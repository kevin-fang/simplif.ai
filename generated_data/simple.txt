constitution||there are three branches||they are the executive branch the legislative branch and the judicial branch||state governments and the federal government work in very similar ways||each state has its own executive legislative and judicial branches||the executive branch of a state government is led by a governor instead of a president.||the executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law||members of the u.s||electoral college elect a president who is the leader of the executive branch as well as the leader of the armed forces||the president may veto a bill that the congress has passed so it does not become a law||the president may also make executive orders to ensure that people follow the law||the president is in charge of many departments that control much of the day-to-day actions of government||for example department of commerce makes rules about trade||the president chooses the heads of these departments and also nominates federal judges||however the senate part of the legislative branch must agree with all of the people the president chooses||the president may serve two -year terms.||the legislative branch makes laws||the legislative branch is called the united states congress||congress is divided into two houses||one house is the house of representatives||the representatives are each elected by voters from a set area within a state||the number of representatives a state has is based on how many people live there||representatives serve two-year terms||the total number of representatives today is ||the leader of the house of representatives is the speaker of the house||the other house is the senate||in the senate each state is represented equally by two senators||because there are states there are senators||the president's treaties or appointments of officials need the senate's approval||senators serve six-year terms||the vice president of the united states serves as president of the senate||in practice the vice president is usually absent from the senate and a senator serves as president pro tempore or temporary president of the senate||representatives and senators propose laws called bills in their respective houses||a bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group known as a committee which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house||if one house votes to pass a bill the bill then gets sent to the other house if both houses vote for it it is then sent to the president who may sign the bill into law or veto it||if the president vetoes the bill it is sent back to congress||if congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two-thirds majority the bill becomes law and cannot be vetoed by the president||under the american system of federalism congress may not make laws that directly control the states instead congress may use the promise of federal funds or special circumstances such as national emergencies to encourage the states to follow federal law||this system is both complex and unique.||the judicial branch is the part of government that interprets what the law means||the judicial branch is made up of the supreme court and many lower courts||if the supreme court decides that a law is not allowed by the constitution the law is said to be struck down and is no longer a valid law||the supreme court is made up of nine judges called justices who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate||one of these justices called the chief justice heads the court||a supreme court justice serves until he or she dies or resigns quits in the middle of his or her term||when that happens the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left||if the senate agrees with that choice the person becomes a justice||if the senate does not agree with the president's choice then the president must nominate someone else||famous court cases such as marbury v madison which was decided in have firmly established that the supreme court is the ultimate interpreter of the united states constitution and has the power to strike down any law that conflicts with it.||the united states of america consists of states territories and district washington d.c.||states can make laws about things inside the state but federal law is about things dealing with more than one state or dealing with other countries||in some areas if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws people must follow the federal law because the state law is not a law any more||each state has a constitution of its own different from the federal national constitution||each of these is like the federal constitution because they say how each state's government is set up but some also talk about specific laws||the federal and most state governments are dominated by two political parties: the republicans and the democrats||there are many smaller parties the largest of these are the libertarian party and the green party||people help in political campaigns that they like||they try to persuade politicians to help them this is called lobbying||all americans are allowed to do these things but some have and spend more money than others or in other ways do more in politics||some people think this is a problem and lobby for rules to be made to change it||since the president is a republican and congress is also republican-controlled so the republicans have more power in the federal government||there are still many powerful democrats who can try to stop the republicans from doing things that they believe will be bad for the country||also members of a party in power do not always agree on what to do||if enough people decide to vote against republicans in the next election they will lose power||in a republic like the united states no party can do whatever they want||all politicians have to argue compromise and make deals with each other to get things done||they have to answer to the people and take responsibility for their mistakes||the usa's large cultural economic and military influence has made the foreign policy of the united states or relations with other countries a topic in american politics and the politics of many other countries.||the united states conquered and bought new lands over time and grew from the original colonies in the east to the current states of which of them are joined together to make up the contiguous united states||these states called the lower can all be reached by road without crossing a border into another country||they go from the atlantic east to the pacific in the west||there are two other states which are not joined to the lower states||alaska can be reached by passing through british columbia and the yukon both of which are part of canada||hawaii is located in the middle of the pacific ocean and is so far from the rest of the us that it can only be reached by airplane||washington d.c||the national capital is a federal district that was split from the states of maryland and virginia in ||not part of any us state it used to be in the shape of a square with the land west of the potomac river coming from virginia and the land east of the river coming from maryland||in virginia took back its part of the land||some people living in dc want it to become a state or for maryland to take back its land so that they can have the right to vote in congress.||the united states consists of sixteen lands that are not states many of which are colonial territories||none of them have any land borders with the rest of the us||people live in five of these places which are de facto american: puerto rico american samoa guam u.s||virgin islands northern mariana islandsthe philippines was a possession of the united states||palau the federated states of micronesia and other pacific island nations were governed by the united states as a united nations trust territory||all of these places

country had a communist revolution.||all the states are divided into administrative subdivisions||most of them are called counties but louisiana uses the word parish and alaska uses the word borough||there are many cities in the united states||one city in each state is the state capital where the government of the state meets and the governor works||this city is not always the largest in its state||for example the city with the most people living in it is new york city in new york state but the state capital is albany||some other big cities are los angeles california chicago illinois

blue stands for justice||the white represents peace and cleanliness||the stripes represent the original colonies..||one of the differences between using bitcoin and using regular money online is that bitcoin can be used without having an internet connection to link any sort of real-world identity to it||unless someone chooses to link their name to a bitcoin address it is hard to tell who owns the address||bitcoin does not keep track of users it keeps track of addresses where the money is||each address has two important pieces of cryptographic information or keys: a public one and a private one||the public key which is what the bitcoin address is created from is similar to an email address anyone can look it up and send bitcoins to it||the private address or private key is similar to an email password only with it can the owner send bitcoins from it||because of this it is very important that this private key is kept secret||to send bitcoins from an address you prove to the network that you own the private key that corresponds to the address without revealing the private key||this is done with a branch of mathematics known as public key cryptography.||a public key is what determines the ownership of bitcoins and is very similar to an id number||if someone wanted to send you bitcoins all you would need to do is supply them your bitcoin address which is a version of your public key that is easier to read and type||for example if bob has bitcoin at the bitcoin address abc and alice has no bitcoins at the bitcoin address def bob can send ||bitcoins to def||as soon as the transaction is processed alice and bob both have ||bitcoins||anyone using the system can see how much money abc has and how much money def has but they cannot tell anything about who owns the address.||in the example above abc and def are the bitcoin addresses of bob and alice||but bob and alice each have a second key which only they individually know||this is the private key and it is the other half of a bitcoin address||the private key is never shared and allows the owner of the bitcoins to control them||however if the private key is not kept secret then anyone who sees it can also control and take the bitcoins there||this happened on live tv when bloomberg's matt miller accidentally showed a private key to viewers||the money was taken immediately||the person who took it told others about it later saying i'll send it back once matt gives me a new address since someone else can sweep [empty] out the old one.||sites or users using the bitcoin system are required to use a global database called the blockchain||the blockchain is a record of all transactions that have taken place in the bitcoin network||it also keeps track of new bitcoins as they are generated||with these two facts the blockchain can keep track of who has how much money at all times.||to generate a bitcoin a miner must solve a math problem||however the difficulty of the math problem depends on how many people are mining for bitcoin at the moment||because of how complicated the math problems usually are they must be calculated with very powerful processors||these processors can be found in cpus graphics cards or specialized machines called asics||the process of generating the bitcoins is called mining||people who use these machines to mine bitcoins are called miners||miners either compete with one another or work together in groups to solve a mathematical puzzle||the first miner or group of miners to solve the particular puzzle are rewarded with new bitcoins||the puzzle is determined by the transactions being sent at the time and the previous puzzle solution||this means the solution to one puzzle is always different from the puzzles before||attempting to change an earlier transaction maybe to fake bitcoins being sent or change the number of someone's bitcoins requires solving that puzzle again which takes a lot of work and also requires solving each of the following puzzles which takes even more work||this means a bitcoin cheater needs to outpace all the other bitcoin miners to change the bitcoin history||this makes the bitcoin blockchain very safe to use.||a popular image associated with bitcoin is a qr code||qr codes are a group of black and white boxes that are similar to barcodes||barcodes are a row of lines and qr codes are a grid of squares||bitcoin uses qr codes because they can store more information in a small space and a camera such as a smartphone can read them||the two qr codes on the bitcoin note are the public and private addresses and can be scanned with a number of online tools.||everyone in the bitcoin network is considered a peer and all addresses are created equal||all transactions can take place solely from peer to peer but a number of sites exist to make these transactions simpler||these sites are called exchanges||exchanges provide tools for dealing in bitcoin||some allow the purchase of bitcoin from external accounts and others allow trading with other cryptography-based currencies like bitcoin||most exchanges also provide a basic wallet service.||wallets provide a handy way to keep track of all of a user's public and private addresses||because addresses are pseudo-anonymous anyone can have as many addresses as they want||this is useful for dealing with multiple people but it can get complicated to manage multiple accounts||a wallet holds all of this information in a convenient place just like a real wallet would||a backup of a wallet prevents 'losing' the bitcoins.||bitcoin adoption and use continues to grow a lot every year||since bitcoin has gained the attention of the mainstream media one way is the wannacry ransomware created in may ||adoption growth has not only happened for consumers but also for many companies who are looking to make use of all of the advantages of bitcoin||among millennials cryptocurrencies were a popular choice to invest in in a recent survey of americans.specifically the survey found that ||of millennials - would invest the in cryptocurrencies compared to ||of generation xers - and ||of baby boomers .what’s more interesting is that bitcoin remains by far the most popular choice followed by ethereum and litecoin||specifically of the millennials in the survey said that they would invest the in bitcoin in ethereum and in litecoin||although the real time price and trading in bitcoin varies with market demand.||bitcoin has often been criticized for its unstable price its network's high electricity consumption and for

controversies have been about people being able to see personal information that other people post and others are about companies and advertisers being able to see users' personal

the more time people spent on facebook over a two-week period the worse they subsequently felt||on the surface facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection||rather than enhancing well-being however these findings suggest that facebook may undermine it.||obama was born on august in kapiʻolani medical center for women and children called

the age of eighteen he went to athens to continue his education at plato's academy||aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years not leaving until after plato's death in bc||he then traveled with xenocrates to asia minor||while in asia aristotle traveled with theophrastus to the island of lesbos where they researched the botany and zoology of the island||soon after hermias' death aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander the great in b.c.aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon||during that time he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings: ptolemy and cassander||aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards persia was ethnocentric||in one famous example he advises alexander to be 'a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants'.pby bc he had returned to athens starting his own school there known as the lyceum||aristotle taught courses at the school for the next twelve years||it is during this period in athens from to when aristotle is believed to have written many of his works||aristotle wrote many dialogues only fragments of which survived||the works that have survived are in fairly rough form||they are generally thought to be lecture notes for his students.aristotle's combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of greek knowledge||it has been suggested that aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time.near the end of alexander's life he began to suspect plots and threatened aristotle in letters||aristotle was vocal about his dislike for alexander's claim of divinity and the king executed aristotle's grandnephew callisthenes as a traitor||alexander died in babylon in without ever having returned to his native land||upon alexander's death anti-macedonian sentiment in athens once again flared up and aristotle fled the city||however he died in euboea of natural causes that same year bc.||the three greatest ancient greek philosophers were aristotle plato and socrates||socrates taught plato then plato taught aristotle||these three thinkers turned early greek philosophy into the beginnings of western philosophy as it is today||aristotle taught alexander the great who later conquered the entire middle east||plato's main ideas were that knowledge from the senses was always confused and not pure||true knowledge can be gotten from the thinking soul that turns away from the world||only the soul can have knowledge of forms the real way things are||the world is only a copy of these forms and is not perfect||aristotle thought differently||he thought that knowledge from the senses was more important||these thoughts became some of the roots of the scientific method after hundreds of years||most of the things aristotle wrote that we still have today are notes from his speaking and teaching||some of his important writings are physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics de anima on the soul and poetics||he also had problems with the atomic theory||he did not believe in democritus' theories about the atomic theory||he believed that all matter was continuous whereas democritus stated the all matter was made up of tiny indivisible things called atoms||democritus was proved right by physicist john dalton in .||aristotle created a form of logic||his logic is called sentential logic because it uses sentences for the syllogism||aristotle's logic influenced the history of western thought||it was aristotle's logic which was copied and used in the arabic and latin mediaeval traditions||it was dominant for two and a half thousand years until the late th century||then modern logic was started by gottlob frege charles sanders peirce and others.||aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail||he certainly did research on the natural history of lesbos and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas||the works history of animals generation of animals and parts of animals have observations and interpretations along with some myths and mistakes||the most striking passages are about the sea-life round lesbos||as well as live observation he got specimens from the catches of fishermen||his observations on catfish electric fish torpedo and angler-fish are detailed||his writing on cephalopods such as octopus sepia cuttlefish and the paper nautilus argonauta argo are accurate||his description of the hectocotyl arm used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the th century||he separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selachē selachimorpha.another good example of his methods comes from the generation of animals in which aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated||he gave accurate descriptions of ruminants' four-chambered fore-stomachs and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark mustelus mustelus.||the works are traditionally listed in this sequence: logiccategories terms on interpretation propositions truth prior analytics syllogistic logic posterior

poetrythe constitution of the athenians fragments||aristotle is still one of the most influential people who ever lived||he contributed to almost every kind of knowledge in his day and he started many new fields||it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did.aristotle was the founder of formal logicp pioneered the study of zoology and helped to develop scientific method.pdespite these achievements aristotle's errors are thought by some such as peter medawar to have held back science considerably||bertrand russell notes that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine||russell also refers to aristotle's ethics as repulsive and calls his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy||russell says these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembers what an advance he made on his predecessors.the immediate influence of aristotle's work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school of philosophers||aristotle's influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition biologists and researchers.||list of biologists||the first known statistics are census data||the babylonians did a census around bc the egyptians around bc and the ancient chinese around bc.||before we can describe the world with statistics we must collect data||the data that we collect in statistics are called measurements||after we collect data we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement||for example suppose we want to find out how popular a certain tv show is||we can pick a group of people called a sample out of the total population of viewers||then we ask each viewer in the sample how often they watch the show||the sample is data that you can see and the population is data that you cannot see since you did not ask every viewer in the population||for another example if we want to know whether a certain drug can help lower blood pressure we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after.||numbers that describe data that you can see are called descriptive statistics||numbers that make predictions about data that you can't see are called inferential statistics||descriptive statistics involves using numbers to describe features of data||for example the average height of women in the united states is a descriptive statistic that describes a feature average height of a population women in the united states||once the results have been summarized and described they can be used for prediction||this is called inferential statistics||as an example the size of an animal is dependent on many factors||some of these factors are controlled by the environment but others are by inheritance||a biologist might therefore make a model that says that there is a high probability that the offspring will be small in size if the parents were small in size||this model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random||testing whether a certain drug can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those of people who are given a placebo.||most often we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments||for example an opinion poll is one kind of survey||we pick a small number of people and ask them questions||then we use their answers as the data||the choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important as it directly influences the statistics||when the statistics are done it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken||suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake||if we take samples next to the waste drain we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far away hard to reach spot of the lake||there are two kinds of problems which are commonly found when taking samples: if there are many samples the samples will likely be very close to what they are in the real population||if there are very few samples however they might be very different from what they are in the real population||this error is called a chance error see errors and residuals in statistics||the individuals for the samples need to be chosen carefully usually they will be chosen randomly||if this is not the case the samples might be very different from what they really are in the total population||this is true even if a great number of samples is taken||this kind of error is called bias.||we can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly||however sometimes large random samples are hard to take||and bias can happen if different people are not asked or refuse to answer our questions or if they know they are getting a fake treatment||these problems can be hard to fix||see also standard error.||the middle of the data is called an average||the average tells us about a typical individual in the population||there are three kinds of average that are often used: the mean the median and the mode||the examples below use this sample data: name a b c d e f g h i j --------------------------------------------- score ||the formula for the mean is x ¯ = n ∑ i = n x i = x x ⋯ x n n \displaystyle \bar x=\frac n\sum _i=nx_i=\frac x_x_\cdots x_nn where x x … x n \displaystyle x_x_\ldots x_n are the data and n \displaystyle n is the population size||see sigma notation||this means that you add up all the values and then divide by the number of values||in our example x ¯ = / = ||\displaystyle \bar x=/=||the problem with the mean is that it does not tell anything about how the values are distributed||values that are very large or very small change the mean a lot||in statistics these extreme values might be errors of measurement but sometimes the population really does contain these values||for example if in a room there are people who make /day and who makes /day||the mean of the data is /day||even though it is the average amount the mean in this case is not the amount any single person makes thus is useless for some purposes||this is the arithmetic mean||other kinds are useful for some purposes.||the median is the middle item of the data||to find the median we sort the data from the smallest number to the largest number and then choose the number in the middle||if there is an even number of data there will not be a number right in the middle so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean||in our example there are items of data the two middle ones are and so the median is / = .||another example like the income example presented for the mean consider a room with people who have incomes of and the median is because is the average of the two middle numbers and ||if the extreme value of is ignored the mean is ||in this case the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out||the median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the definition of mean above.||the mode is the most frequent item of data||for example the most common letter in english is the letter e||we would say that e is the mode of the distribution of the letters||for example if in a room there are people with incomes of and the mode is because occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times||there can be more than one mode||for example if in a room there are people with incomes of and the modes are and ||this is bi-modal or has two modes||bi-modality is very common and often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups||for instance the average height of all adults in the u.s||has a bi-modal distribution||this is because males and females have separate average heights of ||m ft ⁄ in for men and ||m ft in for women||these peaks are apparent when both groups are combined||the mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order.||another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is||a common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the standard deviation||if the standard deviation of a set of data is small then most of the data is very close to the average||if the standard deviation is large though then a lot of the data is very different from the average||if the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution then it is very useful to know the standard deviation||if the data follows this pattern we would say the data is normally distributed about of every pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation||not only that but about of every measurements will be off the average by less that two times the standard deviation and about in will be closer to the average than three standard deviations.||we also can use statistics to find out that some percent percentile number or fraction of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain category||for example social scientists used statistics to find out that of people in the world are males||== references ==||before people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold but no one managed to do that||this was called alchemy||alchemists separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it||they also processed special minerals from a mine in sweden to get rare earth metals||radioactivity was also discovered||today chemists have discovered different elements||some are very common like oxygen||many are very rare and expensive like platinum||some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs like rutherfordium||since the the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists' theories about chemical reactions||with smaller and faster computers chemists have built better tools for analyzing substances||these tools have been sent to study chemicals on mars||police also use those tools to study evidence from crime scenes.||there are several types of chemistry||analytical chemistry looks at which chemicals are in things||for example looking at how much arsenic is in food||organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them||for example making acetylene||inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them||one example is making an integrated circuit||a large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry||this looks at plastics||one example is making nylon||because plastics are made of carbon polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry||another area is biochemistry||this looks at the chemistry of living things||an example would be seeing how arsenic poisons people||biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry||there are many other small branches of chemistry.||the basic unit of an element is called an atom||an atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down turning into a lighter element for example through nuclear fission or radioactive decay||a chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements||in a compound two or more atoms are joined together to form a molecule||the tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules||mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted||an example would be mixing sand and salt||this can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately||chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction||an example would be heating sodium bicarbonate common baking soda||it will make water carbon dioxide and sodium carbonate||this reaction cannot be undone||one very important concept in chemistry is that different atoms interact with one another in very specific proportions||for example two hydrogen atoms interacting with one oxygen atom lead to the water molecule ho||this relationship is known as the law of constant proportions and leads to the idea of stoichiometry a term that refers to the ratios of different atoms in chemical compounds||for example in water there are always exactly hydrogen atoms to oxygen atom||in carbon dioxide there are exactly oxygen atoms for carbon atom||these relationships are described using chemical formulas such as ho two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom and co one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms.||because atoms of different elements react with one another in very specific proportions but atoms of different elements have different weights chemists often describe the amount of different elements and compounds in terms of the number of moles||a mole of any element contains the same number of atoms: atoms||the atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole||for example the atomic mass of copper is about .||that means about ||grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms||the atomic mass of chlorine is about .||that means ||grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it||moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds too||copperii chloride is an example||cucl is its chemical formula||there is one copper atom ||and two chlorine atoms ||· = .||add all the molar masses of the elements together to get the molar mass of the chemical compound ||= .||that means in ||grams of copperii chloride there is one mole of copperii chloride molecules||this concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants chemicals that are reacted should be left||if too much reactant is used there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction.||acids and bases are common chemicals||acids release h ions when in water and bases release oh− ions when in water||acids can react with bases||the h ion is taken from the acid by the base||this makes water ho||a salt is also made when an acid and a base react together||an example would be reacting hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh||hydrochloric acid releases h and cl- ions in water||the base releases na and oh- ions||the h and the oh- react to make water||there is a solution of sodium chloride nacl left||sodium chloride is a salt.||chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science||most objects are made by chemists people who do chemistry||chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances||chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we use every day.||many chemicals are harmless but there are some chemicals that are dangerous||for example mercuryii chloride is very toxic||chromates can cause cancer||tinii chloride pollutes water easily||hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns||some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire||to stay safe chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab||they use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained||the chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly.||periodic table list of common elements common chemical apparatus laboratory techniques chemical techniques glycerol

sanskrit word for the military||the gupta chess pieces were divided like their military into the infantry cavalry elephants and chariots||in time these pieces became the pawn knight bishop and rook||the english words chess and check both come from the persian word shāh meaning king.the earliest written evidence of chess is found in three romances epic stories written in sassanid persia

greatly between about to ||the rules of the older game were changed in the west so that some of the pieces queen bishop had more scope development of the pieces was faster and the game more exciting||the new game formed the basis of modern international chess||historians of chess consider this as the most important change since the game was invented.||the rules of chess are governed by the world chess federation which is known by the initials fide meaning fédération internationale des échecs||the rules are in the section laws of chess of the fide handbook||fide also give rules and guidelines for chess tournaments.||chess is played on a square board divided into eight rows of squares called ranks and eight columns called files with a dark square in each player's lower left corner||this is altogether squares||the colors of the squares are laid out in a checker chequer pattern in light and dark squares||to make speaking and writing about chess easy each square has a name||each rank has a number from to and each file a letter from a to h||this means that every square on the board has its own label such as g or f||the pieces are in white and black sets||the players are called white and black and at the start of a game each player has pieces||the pieces are one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns||in this game out can get up to a quadruple pon king knight queen and also the king although it is very rare.||definitions: vertical lines are files horizontal lines are ranks lines at ° are diagonals||each piece has its own way of moving around the board||the x marks the squares where the piece can move||the knight is the only piece that can jump over another piece||no piece may move to a square occupied by a piece of the same color||all pieces capture the same way they move except pawns||the king's move is one square in any direction||the king k for short may not move to any square where it is threatened by an opposing piece||however the king can move to a square that is occupied by an opponent's piece and capture the piece taking it off the board||the queen q can move any distance in any direction on the ranks files and diagonals||the rooks r move any distance on the ranks or files||the bishops b move diagonally on the board||since a bishop can only move diagonally it will always be on the same color square||the knights kt or n move in an l shape||each move must be either two squares along a rank and one square along a file or two squares along a file and one square along a rank||it is the only piece that can jump over other pieces||like the other pieces it captures an opposing piece by landing on its square||the pawns can only move up the board||on its first move a pawn may move either one or two squares forward||a pawn captures one square diagonally not as it moves: see white circles on its diagram||besides in some situations pawns can capture opponent's pawns in a special way called en passant which means in passing in french see below.||most pieces capture as they move||if a piece lands on an opponent's piece the opposing piece is taken off the board||there are three special cases: the king cannot be taken see check and checkmate||no piece can be taken while castling see below||pawns take one square diagonally.||if a move is made which attacks the opposing king that king is said to be 'in check'||the player whose king is checked must make a move to remove the check||the options are: moving the king capturing the threatening piece or moving another piece between the threatening piece and the king||if the player whose king is in danger cannot do any of these things it is checkmate and the player loses the game.||once in every game each king can make a special move known as castling||when the king castles it moves two squares to the left or right||when this happens the rook is moved to stand on the opposite side of the king||castling is only allowed if all of these rules are kept:p neither piece doing the castling may have been moved during the game||there must be no pieces between the king and the rook||the king may not be currently in check nor may the king pass through any square attacked by the opponent||as with any move castling is not allowed if it would place the king in check.||en passant 'in passing' in french is a special capture||it is only available when a pawn moves forward two squares past an opposing pawn on an adjacent file||the opposing pawn must be on the th rank from its own side||then the opponent's pawn can capture the double-mover as if it had only moved one square forward||this option is open on the next move only.for example if the black pawn has just moved up two squares from g to g then the white pawn on f can take it by en passant on g||the en passant rule was developed when pawns were allowed to make their double move||the rule made it more difficult for players to avoid pawn exchanges and blockade the position||it kept the game more open.||when a pawn moves to its eighth rank it must be changed for a piece: a queen rook bishop or knight of the same color player's choice||normally the pawn is queened but in some advantageous cases another piece is chosen called 'under-promotion'.||checkmates are rare in competitive chess||the most common ends are decisions made by one or both players.||checkmate||when a king is in check and cannot get out of it||resignation||a player may resign at any time usually because his/her position is hopeless||a losing player is able to resign by placing their king on its side on the chessboard||out of time||if player's clock time is over exceeding the time control||strictly speaking this is not part of the rules of the game but part of the rules of tournament and match chess where chess clocks are used.chapter ||draw agreed||a game may end in a draw at any time if one player offers a draw and the other accepts||dead position||a position where no series of legal moves could lead to a mate example: kb vs k||the game is drawn.p stalemate||if a player cannot make a move and the player's king is not in check this is also a draw||this kind of draw is called a stalemate and is rare||-move rule||a game will also end in a draw if no piece is captured and no pawn has moved after fifty moves||this is called the fifty-move rule and happens late in the game||threefold repetition||if the exactly same position is repeated three times during a game with the same player to move each time the player next to move may claim a draw||the game is now drawn||this is called a draw by threefold repetition.||the fide rules for competitive chess include all the above rules plus several others.p et seq||if players wish to adjust a piece on the board they must first say j'adoube i adjust or the equivalent||apart from that if a piece is touched it must be moved if possible||this is the 'touch and move' law.p if no legal move is possible with the touched piece the player must make a legal move with another piece.section p et seq when a player's hand leaves a piece after moving it then the move is over and may not be changed if the move was legal||there are a few famous cases where players appeared to break this rule without being punished||the most famous example was by the then world champion garry kasparov against judit polgar in a top-class tournament.||competitive games of chess must be played with special chess clocks which time a player only when it is his/her turn to move||the essence is that a player has to make a certain number of moves in a certain total time||after moving the player presses a button on the clock||this stops the player's clock and start's the opponent's clock||usually the clocks are mechanical but some are electronic.article p et seq electronic clocks can be set to various programs and they can count moves made.chapter ||the moves of a chess game are written down by using a special chess notation||this is compulsory for any competitive game.article appendix e usually algebraic chess notation is used||in algebraic notation each square has one and only one name whether you are looking from white's side of the board or black's||here moves are written in the format of: initial of piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved||for example qg means queen moves to the g-file and th rank that is to the square g||if there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square one more letter or number is added to show the file or rank from which the piece moved e.g||ngf means knight from the g-file moves to the square f||the letter p showing a pawn is not used so that e means pawn moves to the square e||if the piece makes a capture x is written before the square in which the capturing piece lands on||example: bxf means bishop captures on f||when a pawn makes a capture the file from which the pawn left is used in place of a piece initial||for example: exd means pawn captures on d||if a pawn moves to its eighth rank getting a promotion the piece chosen is written after the move for example eq or e=q||castling is written by the special notations - for kingside castling and -- for queenside||a move which places the opponent's king in check normally has the notation added||checkmate can be written as or ||at the end of the game - means white won - means black won and ½-½ is a draw||in print figurines like those in diagrams but smaller are used for the pieces rather than initials||this has the advantage of being language-free whereas the initials of pieces are different in every language||typefaces which include figurines can be purchased by chess authors||also basic notes can be added by using a system of well-known punctuation marks and other symbols||for example: means a good move means a very good move ? means a bad move ?? a very bad move sometimes called a blunder ? a creative move that may be good and ? a doubtful move||the purpose of these methods is to make publications readable in a wider range of countries||for example one kind of a simple trap known as the scholar's mate as in the diagram to the right may be recorded: ||e e ||qh? nc ||bc nf?? ...qe would prevent the mate with ...nf next move ||qxf - with figurines in place of the initials this would be understood by players everywhere.||players may not smoke in the playing area but only in areas designated by the organiser||mobile phones may not be used or even switched on||players may not use any sources of advice and may not analyse on any device||these and other matters are covered by the fide laws on the conduct of the players.article ||chess is an easy game to learn the moves but a difficult game to master||strategy is an important part of the game||first of all comes the openings about which a great deal is now known||the best-known move the king's pawn opening is the white player moving his king's pawn on e forward two spaces to e||black can reply to that move in various ways.||the first moves of a chess game are called the opening||a chess opening is a name given to a series of opening moves||recognized patterns of opening moves are openings and have been given names such as the ruy lopez or sicilian defence||they are listed in reference works such as the encyclopaedia of chess openings||there are dozens of different openings||they range from gambits where a pawn say is offered for fast development e.g||the king's gambit to slower openings which lead to a manoeuvring type of game e.g||the réti opening||in some opening lines the sequence thought best for both sides has been worked out to – moves but most players avoid such lines||expert players study openings throughout their chess career as opening theory keeps on developing||the basic aims of the opening phase are: development: to place develop the pieces mostly bishops and knights on useful squares where they will have the most powerful impact on the game||control of the center: the center is the most important part of the board||the player who controls the center can move his/her pieces around freely||his/her opponent on the other hand will find his/her pieces cramped and difficult to move about||king safety: keeping the king safe from danger||castling see section above can often do this||pawn structure: pawns can be used to control the center||players try to avoid making pawn weaknesses such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and pawn islands – and to force such weaknesses in the opponent's position.players think and chess databases prove that white by virtue of the first move begins the game with a better chance||black normally tries to equalise or to get some counterplay.||the middlegame is the part of the game after most pieces have been developed||it is where most games are won and lost||many games will end in resignation even before an endgame takes place.a middlegame position has a structure||that structure is determined by the opening||the simplest way to learn the middlegame is to select an opening and learn it well see examples in english opening and french defence||these are some things to look for when looking at a middlegame position: material: changes in the balance of material are critical||to lose a piece for nothing is enough to lose a game||if the players are evenly matched then a rough material balance of pieces is normal||material balance is often quite static: it does not change for many moves||development: the opening may have left one player with a lead in development||that player has the initiative and may attack before the opponent can get his pieces out||it is a temporary asset: if a lead in development is not used effectively it will disappear||the centre: in the centre pieces have their greatest effect and some such as the knight attack more squares in the centre than at the sides||the player who controls the centre will almost always have the advantage||mobility: a position is mobile if the pieces can get where they need to||almost all middle game positions have some limitations to mobility||look for open files for the rooks and open diagonals for the bishops||outposts are what knights need places where they can not easily be dislodged||king safety: where is the king? ideally a king should be castled and kept behind a screen of pawns||many other things may happen in practice||if a king is weak it may be put under direct attack||pawns: they provide the skeleton of a position||they move slowly and may become blocked for many moves||everything takes place round the pawns||different openings produce different pawn structures||in this way openings influence the whole game philidor: pawns are the soul of chess||here is an example from the borderline between opening and middlegame||in the diagram to the left white will operate mainly on the q-side and black on the k-side||white to play may wish to cope with black playing ...nf||he can do this by playing .g or by playing .re so that if ...nf .bf will preserve the bishop in this position an important defensive piece||or maybe white will plough ahead with .c the key move on the q-side||chessbase shows that the number of tournament games with these choices were: .re .g .c the data base also shows that the overall results were significantly better for .re||what the player does is note the features on the board and formulate a plan which takes the features into account||then the player works out a sequence of moves||of course in practice the opponent is interfering with the plan at every step||the endgame or end game or ending is the part of the game when there are few pieces left on the board||there are three main strategic differences between earlier parts of the game and endgame: pawns: during the endgame pawns become more special||in the endgame one thing players try to do is to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank||kings: may become strong pieces in the endgame||the king may be brought towards the center of the board||there it can support its own pawns attack the opponent's pawns and oppose the opponent's king||draws: in the endgame a game may be drawn because there are too few pieces on the board to allow a player to win||this is one of the main reasons for games to be drawn.all endgame positions can be put into two camps||on the one hand are positions which may be won by force||on the other hand are positions which are drawn or which should be drawn||the ones that are drawn for certain may be legally drawn mate could not happen or drawn by chess experience no sane defence could lose||all endgames in master chess revolve around the borderline between winning and drawing||generally once a 'textbook' drawn position is reached the players will agree a draw otherwise they play on||endgames can be studied according to the types of pieces that remain on board||for example king and pawn endgames have only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns||other endings are studied according to the pieces on board other than kings e.g||rook and pawn versus rook endgame.||basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces enough to checkmate the opponent's king||they are usually learned at the beginner stage||examples are mate with kq v k kr v k kb v k kbn v k this one is quite difficult.||there are two types of chess programs||one is to play against you the other is to help you become a better player by learning more||the two types can be made to work together though they have different functions.||chess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents||quite a number have been devised they can play at master level though their processes are quite different from a human being.p||fritz is a german chess program by frans morsch and mathias feist published by chessbase||it is the current market leader||there is also a different kind of fritz called deep fritz that is made for multi-processing||the latest kinds of the consumer products are deep fritz and fritz ||they came with reviews by josh waitzkin who said that fritz is like a woman that you can't get with||it just drives makes you to think in ways you've never thought before.||shredder also a chessbase product is claimed to be the strongest engine at present.||rybka a product by vasik rajlich is shredder's main rival.||chess databases do not actually play||they give access to the recorded history of master chess||there are two components||first there is the software which lets one search and organise the database material||then there is the actual database typically one to four million games||in practice databases are used for two purposes||first for a player to train his/her ability at specific openings||second to look up specific opponents to see what they play and prepare against them beforehand||the existence of chess databases is one of the reasons young players can achieve mastery at an early age.||chessbase is the biggest database and widely used by masters||although it can be used online most users download the software and data onto their computer||if that computer happens to be a laptop then they might take the laptop to tournaments to help prepare for games||players may not use computers or any other aid during games but much preparation goes on behind the scenes||chessbase has to be purchased and it is not cheap.||this is a dutch magazine for advanced players which runs an on-line database called nicbase as part of its services||nicbase is free and has over a million games.||chessgames.com runs an on-line database of games||it is partly free but requires registration||full access to all its facilities is by a fairly modest subscription||it has over half a million games on its database.||there are websites which a player can join for a fee and play on line||in this case the subscriber will play against other subscribers not a computer||all standards of players are amongst the members and various events are on offer at different rates of play||the two leaders in this market are: internet chess club playchess||list of world chess champions list of chess terms chess olympiad chess master titles middlegame shogi ==

other libraries available that make it possible for the python language to do more things||these libraries make it a powerful language it can do many different things||some things that python is often used for are: web development game programming desktop guis scientific programming network programming.||this is a small example of a python program||it shows hello world on the screen||python also does something called dynamic variable assignment||this means that when a number or word is made in a program the user does not have to say what type it is||this makes it easier to reuse variable names making fast changes simpler||an example of this is shown below||this code will make both a number and a word and show them both using only one variable||in a statically typed language like c a programmer would have to say whether x was a number or a word before c would let the programmer set up x and after that c would not allow its type to change from a number to a word.||the ancient greeks had comedies which were presented in competitions at the festival of dionysia||one of the best-known comedy authors of the time was aristophanes about – bc||one of his works the clouds was performed bc||the work did not survive completely but a later version did survive||it is a satire against socrates and pictures the great philosopher as a swaggering con artist||some of the accusations were re-used at socrates' trial twenty years later||typical for satire are that the author criticizes society and living people.||another type of ancient greek theatre was the satyr play||this was mock drunkenness brazen sexuality including phallic props pranks sight gags and general merriment||the modern equivalent would be knock-about comedy.||humour or 'new comedy' is not about criticizing people or ideas but rather about showing characters in funny situations||the most important greek playwright of this type was probably menander||the best known roman comedy writer was plautus||he often used greek comedies for his plays||many comedy plays were written in the by the british writer william shakespeare||shakespeare's comedy plays include: all’s well that ends well the comedy of errors a midsummer nights dream and twelfth night||in shakespeare's day a comedy did not mean a play that would make people laugh or that had a lot of jokes||instead it was a play in which all the problems work out all right in the end||this was unlike a tragedy where the problems do not work out usually resulting in someone's death||the two masks one was smiling the other crying often associated with theatre represent comedy and tragedy.||there are different types of comedy||one type of comedy is called slap stick comedy||in slap stick comedy people do silly things such as tripping falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh||slap stick comedy can be used in comedy movies or comedy television shows||slap stick comedy was used a lot in silent no sound movies from the s||a comedian who acted in the silent movies who used a lot of slapstick comedy was charlie chaplin||in the and comedian jerry lewis also used silly slap stick comedy in his comedy movies.||a comedy is a very popular type of movie||some comedy movies have slapstick comedy in which people just do silly things such as tripping falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh||other comedy movies show funny stories or situations in which people are behaving in a silly manner||some comedies make the audience laugh by showing strange or unusual images or situations that do not make sense.||a parody or spoof movie imitates or exaggerates another person or movie to make them seem silly dumb or just plain out of it.||some types of comedy movies mix comedy with other types of movies||there is a type of movie called a dramedy which is a mix of a drama movie and a comedy movie||there is also a type of movie called a romantic comedy sometimes called a rom-com||in romantic comedies there is a love story about a couple who fall in love along with silly or funny comedy parts.||comedy shows are very popular on television||comedy shows on television

idea of human rights started in the european enlightenment||in the th century some people started suggesting that everyone had the religious and political right to choose their religion and their leaders||this sort of thinking was important in the english civil war||after the war the philosopher john locke argued that people should have these rights he was one of the first people to call them human rights||these ideas were also important in the american revolution and the french revolution in the th century||in the th century john stuart mill was an important philosopher who also thought about human rights||he said that people should be able to control their own bodies and minds||he talked about three special ideas: freedom of speech freedom of assembly freedom to do what a person wishes if it does not harm others even if other people think it is badhegel was a philosopher who talked about the idea of free will||he also talked about what makes a person free: that a person has to have certain relations with other people to have true freedom||a person has to be able to: own property make contracts with other people make moral promises to people live with anyone get protection from laws have a voice in government||because people believe that human rights are important countries make laws to protect them||these laws say that governments cannot take away people's basic rights||they make sure people who take away other people's rights are punished||some major political organizations have made statements that promote human rights||these are not laws but they affect us anyway||if groups or countries do not follow these statements others will condemn them say that they are very bad and then people may not talk with them do business with them or help them||some of the important places that human rights laws are written is in constitutions||the united states constitution and constitution of france are two of the oldest set of laws based on human rights||in the united nations made the universal declaration of human rights||this is a widely respected document that says what the united nations believes are human rights||it is not a law but is the basis on which two important agreements are written: the international covenant on civil and political rights the international covenant on economic social and cultural rightsthese are united

treaties and documents made by united nations and other international organizations||those treaties and documents are called international human rights law.||not everyone agrees on what the basic human rights are||it is very clear that few countries permit all these rights||also there are countries in which the rights are not illegal but nothing is done to promote them||here is a list of some of the most recognized rights:||right to live to be a citizen of a country right to housing to own property||safety from violence physical mental and sexual to seek asylum if a country treats you badly fair trial and to be considered innocent until proven guilty||the right to get an education health care medical care to believe and practice the religion a person wants||right to marriage and

along similarly also keeping in count the universal rights||human rights abuse happens when a person is hurt in a way that violates goes against his/her human rights||human rights abuses are also often called human rights violations||examples of human rights abuses or violations are:putting a person in jail because they said that the government is doing bad things or because they are religious or not religious||taking a person's home because they are from a different country not letting someone who is a citizen of a country vote because he or she has the wrong kind of attribute as mentioned on top of article||violence toward someone because they have a or any religion or a different religion to the one of the abuser.many people groups and countries think protecting human rights is very important||but not everyone in the world believes in human rights||if people who do not believe in human rights have political power they can hurt many people||even if these people have no political power they can be violent to other people||there are many people who work to protect everyone's human rights some of these are government groups and some are not with any government||they are sometimes called human rights organizations||amnesty international and human rights watch are examples of human rights organizations.||united nations human rights council united nations high

something to them||most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience||however if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well then the art work may become publicly successful.||there are sculptures cave painting and rock art dating from the upper paleolithic era||all of the great ancient civilizations such as ancient egypt india china greece rome and

parasitic worms and over species of protozoa some derived from our primate ancestors and some acquired from the animals we have domesticated or come in contact with during our relatively short history on earth||our knowledge of parasitic infections extends into antiquity.||when the above definition is applied many organisms which eat plants can be seen as parasites because they feed largely or wholly on one individual plant||examples would include many herbivorous insects: the hemiptera or true bugs leafhoppers froghoppers aphids scale insects and whiteflies||the larvae of lepidoptera usually feed and mature on a single individual of the host plant species and what they eat accounts for most of the food for their complete life span||moreover caterpillars can and often do serious damage to the host's foliage||other orders also have many parasitic herbivores: thysanoptera thrips coleoptera beetles diptera flies||parasites of larger animals account for much research done for veterinarian and medical purposes||these parasites include viruses bacteria protozoa flatworms flukes and tapeworms nematodes roundworms arthropods crustacea insects mites||parasitic wasps and flies are of great interest to the entomologist and may be used in biological control||on the other hand many blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes have only brief contact with a host and so perhaps should not be regarded as parasites.pa huge number of species are parasitic||a survey of the feeding habits of british insects showed that about were parasites on plants and slightly more were parasites on animals||that means that nearly of insects in britain are parasitic||since british insects are better known than those elsewhere because of the length of time they have been studied this means that the majority of insect species throughout the world are parasitic||also there are several other invertebrate phyla which are wholly or largely parasitic||flatworms and roundworms are found in virtually every wild species of vertebrate||protozoan parasites are also ubiquitous||hence parasitism is almost certainly the most common feeding method on earth||it is clear that parasitism as a way of life is more common than all other feeding strategies combined.p||ectoparasites live on the outside of a plant or animal||endoparasites live inside a plant or animal||intracellular parasites live inside cells intercellular parasites live in the spaces between cells||parasitoids are organisms whose larval development takes place within another organism's body resulting in the death of the host||there are twelve superfamilies of wasps which are entirely or mainly parasitoid such as the ichneumonoid wasps whose species number over ||the interaction between the parasitoid and the host is fundamentally different from true parasites and their host and shares some characteristics with predation||a vector is a third party that carries the parasite to the host||thus with malaria the mosquito is the vector the plasmodium protozoan is the parasite and the mammal is the host||the mosquito is an ectoparasite as well as a vector||an epiparasite is one that feeds on another parasite||kleptoparasites steal food from other species||brood parasites such as the cuckoo induce other species to raise their young||the cowbird is another brood parasite||social parasites take advantage of interactions between members of social organisms such as ants or termites.||parasites are adapted to small separated habitats||for a parasite each host is an island surrounded by a hostile environment||for a small organism the distances between hosts or groups of hosts is a hazard||adaptations to bridge this hazard are: mass production of spores or eggs||dispersal of fertile females||dispersal by attaching to a larger organism many ectoparasites||extreme longevity of resting stages spores or cysts||for example plant parasitic nematodes may remain quiescent for years||parthenogenesis and inbreeding among offspring of a single female are common in parasites.so parasites exist in small genetically similar groups with little flow of genes between them||in consequence they have adaptations to solve their problems of dispersal and reproduction.||parasites face an environment which varies in time and space||consequently both local geographic races and polymorphism occur||both may occur in the same species||parasites are very specialised feeders: many species have only one host at any stage of their life cycle||a few use more than two host species.||many parasites have complex life-cycles||tremadodes the flukes are a parasitic class of flatworms platyhelminths with over species||most of them infect molluscs in the first part of the life-cycle and vertebrates in the second part||the biology of scrub typhus is even more complex||it involves these factors: ||the pathogen bacterium rickettsia||chiggers which are ectoparasitic mites||small mammals especially rats||scrubby vegetation with moist conditions ||humans passing through patches where the above are present.the occurrence of all these factors together would be limited in space and brief in time||this is typical of the ecology of parasitic infections.||both evolutionary rates and speciation rates can be high||sibling species are very common in the bug erythroneura in which about transfers from one host to another has resulted in about species in the genus.the clearest evidence comes from the large size of many parasitic families||even though some parasitic taxa evolved much later than predatory taxa families of parasites on plants are on average almost eight times larger than those of predators and families of parasites on animals are over ten times larger.psometimes there is good evidence of the speed of speciation||for example five or more species of the moth hedylepta must have evolved within years in hawaii because they are specific to banana which was only introduced then.||adaptive radiation in parasites is extensive||its development in each taxon group depends on: the diversity of the hosts||how many species there are in the group being parastised and how different they are from each other||the size of the host target: body size population geographical distribution||the evolutionary time available for colonisation of hosts||the selective pressure for evolutionary modification.diversity of hosts is a big factor||if many related species of host are available then many related species of parasite will evolve||mites on lepidoptera families or fleas on mammals and birds are good examples||eichler's rule goes as follows: when a large group of hosts consisting of a wide variety of species is compared with an equivalent group consisting of few representatives the larger group has the greater diversity of parasitic fauna.the two british oaks support some species of parasite directly and indirectly many hundred more which parasitise these parasites||it would certainly be an underestimate to say that the two british species of oak are the primary products for a thousand species of parasite.p obviously the large size of these trees is a factor in the number of parasite species||in general this holds whether the host is a plant or an animal||a larger bird will harbour more species of ectoparasite than a small bird.||one of the reasons large trees have so many parasites is that they may have lived a long time in a particular area compared with other types of plant||they have had longer to accumulate parasites||parasites can be most useful in sorting out the phylogenetic relationships of their hosts||sibling host species have been discovered when their parasites diverged||common ancestors of present-day parasites were themselves parasites of the common ancestors of present-day hosts.||as the host evolves defences so the parasite evolves to cope with this||this is co-evolution||consider two families of host plants the umbellifers fennel cumin parsley hemlock and the gramineae grasses||the umbellifers have many aromatic species and are chemically diverse and pharmaceutically interesting||their resins and oils are defences against herbivory and parasitism||on the other hand grasses have one big defence to herbivores: their stony inclusions in their cells wear down the teeth of herbivorous mammals but they have few chemical defences||both families are attacked by leaf-miner flies||there are four times as many grass species as there are umbellifers but there are twice as many leaf-miner species on the umbellifers||this is apparently because the chemical diversity of potential hosts within the umbelliferae has forced specialisation of the parasites||eighty-two percent of the species of leaf-miner attack only one genus each.||this is speciation which does not require geographical isolation||ernst mayr the chief exponent of geographical speciation admitted that host races of phytophagous animals constitute the only known case indicating the possible occurrence of incipient sympatric speciation.||wikipedia began as a related project

was launched on january ||it was launched as an english-language edition at www.wikipedia.com and announced by sanger on the nupedia mailing list||wikipedia's policy of neutral point-of-view was codified in its initial months and was similar to nupedia's earlier nonbiased policy||otherwise there were not very many rules initially and wikipedia operated independently of nupedia.wikipedia gained early contributors from nupedia slashdot and also from search engines||it grew to about articles and languages by the end of ||by late it had languages by the end of and by the end of ||nupedia and wikipedia both existed until nupedia's servers were stopped in ||after this its text was incorporated into wikipedia||the english wikipedia passed the million-article mark on september making it

project would constitute documents if they were discovered to contain alien communication.||what most people understand when they speak of a document one can see from the connotations and denotations that appear in a search for document||from these usages one can infer the following typical connotations: writing that provides information especially information of an official nature anything serving as a representation of a person's thinking by means of symbolic marks a written account of ownership or obligation to record in detail the parents documented every step of their child's development a digital file in a particular format to support or supply with references can you document your claims? an artifact that meets a legal notion of document for purposes of discovery in litigation||technology to manage documents has developed with documents themselves||of particular importances are practices concerning the preservation archival destruction and management of documents||these together are called the document life cycle physical preservation: documents in both traditional physical forms and in digital physical forms such as magnetic media must be physically preserved||this aspect of document management deals with such issues as the aging of paper the innovation of acid-free paper is an advance in preservation and obsolescence of magnetic media.storage: this aspect includes management of scarce resources such as shelf space and disk space and associated technologies such as optimal space utilization||modern libraries such as the university of nevada and the university of michigan often use complex space-saving technologies such as robotic retrieval systems for stacks and moving bookshelves||in the digital realm the entire discipline of compression technologies can be viewed as concerned with the storage of documents.cultural preservation: this function traditionally ascribed to librarians involves the selection arrangement and storage of documents in safe places||the importance of this part of document life cycle management can be seen in the impact of historical events such as the burning of the library of alexandria||today library and information science has developed into an important academic discipline.bibliometrics: this aspect of document management involves functions of indexing generating statistics and taxonomies and improving the usability of large collections of documents||the modern history of this management technology dates back to melvil dewey and the dewey decimal system||today the science of bibliometrics is largely concerned with managing the impact of electronic technologies||this aspect must also deal with isbn numbers library of congress data and other standards.digital content management: the explosion of digital content has resulted in technologies to manage large collections of digital information generated by organizations||such systems must manage access control and privileges multiple electronic format interface with printing infrastructures and enable collaborative workflows around documents.digital-physical interaction management: as long as both paper and digital documents continue to have value the modern management technologies to manage their interaction will continue||key to this management is the management of large scale and systematic scanning of physical documents such as the google book scanning project.destruction: with the increased cost of identity theft corporate scandals and privacy concerns the destruction of both paper and electronic documents has become increasingly important to manage||technologies such as shredders play a role as do verifiable processes of destruction of electronic documents to ensure compliance with privacy laws.security: shannon's information theory has led to an entire discipline that concerns itself with the security of documents and associated technologies such as encryption as well as more physical security features such as watermarks and making currency documents safe from counterfeiting.transportation: the entire postal system as well as modern courier systems is largely built on the need to move documents physically from one location to the other.||book illuminated manuscript seal device typewriter||there are two main kinds of book text: fiction and non-fiction.||these books are novels about stories that did not happen and have been imagined by the author||some books are based on real events from history but the author has created imaginary characters or dialogue for the events.||books of non-fiction are about true facts or things that have really happened||some examples are dictionaries cookbooks textbooks for learning in school or a biography someone's life story.||between the written manuscript and the book lie several inventions||manuscripts are hand-made but books are now industrial products.||a common type of manuscript was the scroll which was a long sheet rolled up||the sheet could have been made of papyrus made by the egyptians by weaving the inner stems of the papyrus plant and then hammering them together or parchment or vellum very thin animal skin first used by the ancient greeks or paper made from plant fibers invented by the chinese||manuscripts of this kind lasted to the th century and beyond||turning the manuscript into a book required several developments.||the romans were the first people to put separate pieces of manuscript between covers to form a codex||this was more convenient to handle and store than scrolls but was not yet a book as we understand it.||scrolls and codices were written and copied by hand||the chinese invented woodblock printing where shapes are carved out of a block of wood then ink is applied to the carved side and the block is pressed onto paper||this woodcut method was slow because the symbols and pictures were made by cutting away the surrounding wood||johannes gutenberg was the first to invent a machine for printing the printing press in the th century||this involved more than just a press it involved the production of movable metal type suitable for the machine process||initially the machines were slow and needed a printer to work with them||fast and automatic machines did not arrive until the th century.||paper had been invented in china in the th century but it was kept secret for a long time||in europe hand-made paper was available from about ||it was expensive and the early printing was a slow process||therefore books remained rare||in the first machines for making paper from wood pulp were invented||new kinds of inks were also invented for various purposes and machines were driven by steam engines and later by electricity.the common cheap supply of paper fed the faster printing machines and books became cheaper||at the same time in america britain and continental europe more people learnt to read||so in the th century many ordinary people could afford to buy books and could actually read them||also in the th century came public libraries so poorer people could get access to the best books.||printing was done on large sheets of paper which were then folded guillotined cut and sewn in sections and finally placed into the covers||all these processes were done by machines during the th century.||today some of the technologies have been changed especially those involving illustration and typography||however books look much the same as they did with more illustration in colour but basically the same||that is because experience has shown that readers need certain things for pleasurable reading||graphic design and typography are the practical arts used to make books attractive and useful to readers.||literature reading||composition music||the word “classic” tends to mean: an art which is so good that it will always be enjoyed by future generations||it is something that has become a model for future artists||the period of ancient greece and rome is known as the classical period because many centuries later people looked back to those ancient civilizations and thought they were perfect||in recent european history the th century was known as the classical period because musicians artists writers and philosophers were inspired by the art forms of the classical period of ancient greece and rome||something that is a “classic” is therefore something that will always be remembered as something great||famous books such as the novels of charles dickens are called classics||“classical music” therefore tends to mean music that will not be forgotten soon after it is written but is likely to be enjoyed by many future generations.||although people sometimes think of classical music as the opposite of pop music it can still be very popular||like all kinds of music classical music can be in many different moods: happy sad scary peaceful thoughtful simple etc||mozart wrote his serenades and divertimentos to entertain people at parties||classical pieces of music can be quite short but they can also be very long like a big musical story||a symphony by mahler or shostakovich can last for nearly an hour and an opera is a whole evening’s entertainment||classical music is also different from jazz because true jazz is improvised||however the differences are not always obvious||classical music has often been inspired by jazz and jazz by classical music||george gershwin wrote music which is both jazz and classical||classical music too can be improvised||the great composers bach mozart and beethoven often improvised long pieces of music on the organ harpsichord or piano||sometimes they wrote these improvistions down||they were in effect compositions which were composed in one go.||in western countries a vast amount of music was written for christian worship in churches and cathedrals||this is called “sacred” religious music||all other music is “secular” music||the word “secular” means things that are not sacred||sacred and secular music have influenced one another in many ways during the course of music history||secular music was largely influenced by dance and this in turn changed the style of scared music||for example: the church music of the th century composer giovanni da palestrina has nothing to do with dance music but both the sacred and secular music of johann sebastian bach two centuries later is full of dance rhythms||at some times in music history there have been different styles of composing for sacred and for secular music||claudio monteverdi uses two different styles for his church and for his non-church music||when composers were experimenting with new ways of writing music they usually did this with secular music and sacred music caught up later.||the term classical music was not used until the early th century||people then started talking about classical music in order to praise the great composers such as bach mozart and beethoven||in the th century many different ways of composing were used including music played by electronic instruments or very modern music using strange sounds experimental or avant garde music for example the music of john cage||some people feel that this kind of music cannot really be described as classical music.||classical music can be for instruments or for the voice||the symphony orchestra is the most common group of instruments for the playing of classical music||it has four families of instruments: the string instruments which include the violins violas cellos and piano the woodwind instruments which include flutes oboesclarinets and bassoons together with related instruments of different sizes the brass instruments: trumpet trombone tuba and french horn and percussion instruments which nearly always includes timpani as well as many other possible instruments which are hit or shaken||this is very different from a typical rock band which has a drummer a guitarist one or two singers and an electric bass and keyboard||instruments that play classical music are not normally amplified electronically||the same applies to the voice||singers may be sopranos altos tenors or basses depending on their vocal range||their voices are not amplified||opera singers in particular have to develop very powerful voices which will be heard over the orchestra and project right to the back of an opera house||the instruments used in classical music developed at different times||some of the earliest were known in medieval music||the trombone and the triangle have hardly changed for hundreds of years but the violin family developed from folk instruments such as fiddles and gradually replaced the viols to form the basis of the modern orchestra||this was happening by the beginning of the th century which was the time when opera was invented||in general musical instruments have become louder as concert halls have become bigger||violins are louder than viols||modern violins are louder than the early th century violins largely because of they have metal strings instead of gut strings||the piano developed from the clavichord which was very quiet indeed||woodwind instruments developed from renaissance instruments while the clarinet was invented in the middle of the th century and the saxophone and tuba came even later||modern trumpets sound much brighter than the straight trumpets of the th century.||most popular music is based on song form but classical music has many different forms some of which can be used over a long time span to make big compositions||classical music can have many forms including the symphony concerto oratorio opera sonata fugue or any combination of dance movements such as suites||in many of the longer compositions short tunes are developed and changed during the course of the piece||beethoven’s fifth symphony is a good example of a piece which develops from just four notes into a large piece lasting about half an hour.||people who want to be good at performing classical music have to practice hard for many years||they normally have formal training at a music college or conservatoire and have lessons from well-known music teachers||classical musicians often spend a lot of time thinking carefully about pieces of music especially about pieces of music that they perform||they study such things as harmony and counterpoint to help them understand the way that the composers were thinking when they put the piece together||when they look at pieces of music in this way this is called “musical analysis”||people who specialize in thinking and writing about music may become professors or lecturers of music at universities||classical music is often heard in popular culture||it is used as background music for movies television programs advertisements and even for mobile phone ringing tones||most people in the western world recognize many classical tunes possibly without even realizing it||some classical pieces of music have become enormously popular e.g||the song nessun dorma from giacomo puccini's opera turandot which was sung by the three tenors luciano pavarotti plácido domingo and josé carreras and used as the theme tune for the soccer world cup||this made many people who had never been interested in opera start to become curious about it.||the history of classical music really started in the late middle ages||music written for the church was almost always vocal singing because instruments were thought to be wicked||this is because the devil played them and because they were used for dancing||there was a lot of dance music but most of it is lost because it was never written down||medieval composers who are remembered today include léonin pérotin and guillaume de machaut||the renaissance was from the th century until the th century||this period saw a massive increase in the composition of music both sacred and secular||many great cathedrals had been built in europe and composers wrote music for them mostly vocal music||secular music also became extremely popular especially songs and madrigals which would sometimes be accompanied by instruments||the greatest composers of this period include: giovanni da palestrina orlando di lasso thomas tallis and william byrd.||the baroque period was from about the th century until the mid-th century||this was the time when the modern orchestra was formed more or less as we know it||it was also the time when opera was invented||most musicians worked either for the church or for rich people who had their own orchestras||many of them also started to work for opera houses||the greatest composers of this time include: claudio monteverdi heinrich schütz henry purcell antonio vivaldi george frideric handel johann sebastian bach domenico scarlatti and georg philipp telemann||the years between - was known as the classical period||composers thought a lot about the forms of their pieces and were influenced by the classical art of the ancient greeks and romans||the symphony was invented and various forms of chamber music including the string quartet||the greatest composers include: joseph haydn wolfgang amadeus mozart christoph willibald gluch and ludwig van beethoven.||from to was known as the romantic period||composers continued to use the forms that had been invented in the th century but they also thought that personal feeling and emotion were very important||music for orchestra sometimes told a story programme music||musicians who played their instruments brilliantly such as paganini were worshipped like heroes||beethoven and schubert belong in many ways to this period as well as to the classical period||it was a time when there were a lot of changes in society||after the wars that napoleon had waged there were not so many ruling aristocratic families||there was a lot of feeling of nationalism as countries united||th century music is often nationalistic: composers wrote music that was typical of their own country||some of the greatest composers include: ludwig van beethoven franz schubert hector berlioz frédéric chopin robert schumann felix mendelssohn anton bruckner johannes brahms pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky edward elgar gustav mahler and richard strauss.||what is known as th century classical music or “modern music” is music from about onwards||at this time many composers felt that everything had already been done by the composers of the past so they wanted to find new ways of composing||claude debussy arnold schoenberg and igor stravinsky in particular found new ways of writing music which was not necessarily tonal in any particular key||classical music was influenced by jazz especially with american composers||later in the century people such as pierre boulez and karlheinz stockhausen experimented in many other ways including with electronic music tape recorders etc.||today’s composers have combined some of these ideas to develop their own styles||some of the most important composers are: claude debussy jean sibelius maurice ravel arnold schoenberg igor stravinsky béla bartók aaron copland benjamin britten dmitri shostakovich leonard bernstein philip glass dmitri kabalevsky james macmillan judith weir peter maxwell davies||it has never been possible to say exactly what is meant by “classical music”||many different kinds of music influence one another||since it has been even harder to make clear dividing lines between rock pop classical folk jazz and world music||this shows that classical music like other kinds of music continues to develop and reflect the society from which it comes.||nocturne||a computer is a programmable electronic device designed to accept data perform prescribed mathematical and logical

them||here are a few of the computers they built: konrad zuse's electromechanical z machines||the z was the first working machine that used binary arithmetic||binary arithmetic means using yes and no||to add numbers together||you could also program it||in the z was proved to be turing complete||turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is

through and is sometimes called the first general purpose electronic computer since konrad zuse's z of used electromagnets instead of electronics||at first however the only way to reprogram eniac was by rewiring it.several developers of eniac saw its problems||they invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it and a way to change what it remembered||this is known as stored

machine ssem or baby while the edsac completed a year after ssem was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design||shortly afterwards the machine originally described by von neumann's paper—edvac—was completed but was not ready for two years||nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture||it has become the main concept which defines a modern computer||the technologies used to build computers have changed since the but many current computers still use the von-neumann architecture||in the computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes||transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the because they were smaller and cheaper||they also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes||in the technologies were based on integrated circuits||microprocessors such as the intel made computers smaller cheaper faster and more reliable||by the microcontrollers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like washing machines||the also saw home computers and personal computers||with the evolution of the internet personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in

carry around||both laptops and desktops are called personal computers because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music surfing the web or playing video games||there are bigger computers that many people at a time can use||these are called mainframes and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work||you can think of a personal computer like this: the personal computer is like your skin: you can see it other people can see it and through your skin you feel wind water air and the rest of the world||a mainframe is more like your internal organs: you never see them and you barely even think about them but if they suddenly went missing you would have some very big problems||an embedded computer also called embedded system is a computer that does one thing and one thing only and usually does it very well||for example an alarm clock is an embedded computer: it tells the time||unlike your personal computer you cannot use your clock to play tetris||because of this we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed because you cannot install more programs on your clock||some mobile phones automatic teller machines microwave ovens cd

the internet watching tv and movies listening to music communicating with other people downloading sending e-mail using internet recording calculating editing video photo taking pictures photography drawing study purposes||word processing spreadsheets excel powerpoint presentations photo editing photoshop gimp e-mail video editing/rendering/encoding audio recording system management||computers store data and the instructions as numbers because computers can do things with numbers very quickly||these data are stored as binary symbols and s||a or a symbol stored by a computer is called a bit which comes from the words binary digit||computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use||a list of instructions is called a program and is stored on the computer's hard disk||computers work through the program by using a central processing unit and they use fast memory called ram as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this||when the computer wants to store the results of the program for later it uses the hard disk because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off||an operating system tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do how to do these jobs and how to tell people the results||millions of computers may be using the same operating system while each computer can have its own application programs to do what its user needs||using the same operating systems makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things||a user who needs to use a computer for something different can learn how to use a new application program||some operating systems can have simple command lines or a fully user-frendly gui.||one of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication||communication is how people share information||computers have helped people move forward in science medicine business and learning because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information||they also let other people communicate with each other do their jobs almost anywhere learn about almost anything or share their opinions with each other||the internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers.||a computer is now almost always an electronic device||it usually contains materials that will become electronic waste when discarded||when a new computer is bought in some places laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for||this is called product stewardship||computers can become obsolete quickly depending on what programs the user runs||very often they are thrown away within two or three years because some newer programs require a more powerful computer||this makes the problem worse so computer recycling happens a lot||many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly as most people do not need to run new programs||some computer parts such as hard drives can break easily||when these parts end up in the landfill they can put poisonous chemicals like lead into the ground water||hard drives can also contain secret information like credit card numbers||if the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away an identity thief can get the information from the hard drive even if the drive doesn't work and use it to steal money from the previous owner's bank account.||computers come in different forms but most of them have a common design||all computers have a cpu||all computers have some kind of data bus which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment||all computers have some form of memory||these are usually chips integrated circuits which can hold information||many computers have some kind of sensors which lets them get input from their environment||many computers have some kind of display device which lets them show output||they may also have other peripheral devices connected.a computer has several main parts||when comparing a computer to a human body the cpu is like a brain||it does most of the 'thinking' and tells the rest of the computer how to work||the cpu is on the motherboard which is like the skeleton||it provides the basis for where the other parts go and carries the nerves that connect them to each other and the cpu||the motherboard is connected to a power supply which provides electricity to the entire computer||the various drives cd drive floppy drive and on many newer computers usb flash drive act like eyes ears and fingers and allow the computer to read different types of storage in the same way that a human can read different types of books||the hard drive is like a human's memory and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer||most computers have a sound card or another method of making sound which is like vocal cords or a voice box||connected to the sound card are speakers which are like a mouth and are where the sound comes out||computers might also have a graphics card which helps the computer to create visual effects such as d environments or more realistic colors and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images in the same way a well trained artist can..||the president of the united states is elected by the electoral college||some other countries choose a president this way||in some the parliament does it||some countries have direct elections to choose a president||many countries have a monarch instead of a president and some have neither||companies have presidents||they are elected by the people who own part of the company||in some companies the people who are workers for the company elect vote for their company president.||the president of a country is not the same thing as a prime minister||a prime minister is part of a parliament but a president is not||in some countries such as the united states or france the president has more power and responsibility than anyone else||such a president is often called the nation's chief executive||as chief executive the president must take an active role in all phases of government||in other countries such as the republic of ireland or israel to be president is more of an honor or a symbol and the position has no real power||this kind of president is often called head of state||most countries that have a king or queen as their monarch have no president||the american president is restricted by the written united states constitution which can be changed but only if two-thirds of congress as well as the president and three-fourths of the states agree to it||the american constitution was created to make sure that the american executive never became as powerful as the british system it had broken away from||the british prime minister is part of both the legislature and executive whereas the american president is the head of the executive||the american governmental system shows a clear separation of powers unlike the british system||all the president's ministerial appointments have to be vetted by congress parliament and congress may have an opposition majority||the president does not have the ability to introduce and influence legislation in the same way as the british prime minister||congress has much greater control over the budget and foreign policy than the british parliament||there are broad areas of american life such as education crime and punishment over which the president has virtually no influence at all||the president even has very limited control over the economy.so despite having a large nuclear arsenal the american president can not carry out policy and introduce legislation as freely as the british prime minister.||monarch||contract law sets rules on agreements to buy and sell items and services||medical law sets rules and guidelines for medical professionals it also states a patient's own medical rights||physician-patient privilege protects the patient's private conversations with a medical physician doctor this also extends to their personal information like their contact details shared with medical personnel||property law states the rights and obligations that a person has when they buy sell or rent homes and land called real property or realty and objects called personal property||intellectual property ip law involves the rights people have over things they create such as art music and literature||this is called copyright||it also protects inventions that people make by a kind of law called patent||it also covers the rights people have to the names of a company or a distinctive mark or logo||this is called trademark||trust law business law sets out the rules for money that is put into an investment such as pension funds that people save up for their retirement||it involves many different types of law including administrative and property law||tort law helps people to make claims for compensation repayment when someone hurts them or hurts their property||criminal law is used by the government to prevent people from breaking laws and punish people who do break them||constitutional law deals with the important rights of the government and its relationship with the people||it mainly involves the interpretation of a constitution including things like the separation of powers of the different branches of government||a court order is an official proclamation by a judge that defines and authorizes the carrying out of certain steps for one or more parties to a case||administrative law is used by ordinary citizens who want to challenge decisions made by governments||it also involves things like regulations and the operation of the administrative agencies||international law is used to set out rules on how countries can act in areas such as trade the environment or military action||the geneva conventions on the conduct of war and the roerich pact are examples of international law||custom and tradition are practices that are widely adopted and agreed upon in a society thought often not in a written form||custom and tradition can be enforced in courts and are sometimes considered as part of the legal reasoning in matters decided in courts||in some societies and cultures all law is or was custom and tradition though this is increasingly rare although there are some parts of the world where custom tradition are still binding or even the predominant form of law for example tribal lands or failed states.||civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today||civil law is based on legislation that is found in constitutions or statutes passed by government||the secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom||in civil law governments judges do not generally have much power and most of the laws and legal precedent are created by members of parliament||common law is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases||it comes from england and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to the british empire except malta scotland the u.s||state of louisiana and the canadian province of quebec||it is also the predominant form of law in the united states where many laws called statutes are written by congress but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts||common law had its beginnings in the middle ages when king john was forced by his barons to sign a document called the magna carta.||religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books||examples include the jewish halakha islamic sharia and christian canon law||until the sharia law was the main legal system throughout the muslim world||in some muslim countries such as saudi arabia and iran the whole legal systems still base their law on sharia law||islamic law is often criticised because it often has harsh penalties for crimes||a serious criticism is the judgement of the european court that sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy.the turkish refah party's sharia-based plurality of legal systems grounded on religion was ruled to contravene the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms||the court decided refah's plan would do away with the state's role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms and infringe the principle of non-discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy.||the history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilizations||ancient egyptian law developed in bc||in bc king hammurabi took ancient babylonian law and organized it and had it chiseled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace||these laws became known as the code of hammurabi||the torah from the old testament is an old body of law||it was written around bc||it has moral rules such as the ten commandments which tell people what things are not permitted||sometimes people try to change the law||for example if prostitution is illegal they try to make it legal.||in democracies the people in a country usually choose people called politicians to represent them in a legislature||examples of legislatures include the houses of parliament in london the congress in washington d.c||the bundestag in berlin the duma in moscow and the assemblée nationale in paris||most legislatures have two chambers or houses a 'lower house' and an 'upper house'||to pass legislation a majority of members of parliament must vote for a bill in each house||the legislature is the branch of government that writes laws and votes on whether they will be approved.||the judiciary is a group of judges who resolve people's disputes and determine whether people who are charged with crimes are guilty||in some jurisdictions the judge does not find guilt or innocence but instead directs a jury how to interpret facts from a legal perspective but the jury determines the facts based on evidence presented to them and finds the guilt or innocences of the charged person||most countries of common law and civil law systems have a system of appeals courts up to a supreme authority such as the supreme court or the high court||the highest courts usually have the power to remove laws that are unconstitutional which go against the constitution.||the executive is the governing center of political authority||in most democratic countries the executive is elected from people who are in the legislature||this group of elected people is called the cabinet||in france the us and russia the executive branch has a president which exists separately from the legislature||the executive suggests new laws and deals with other countries||as well the executive usually controls the military the police and the bureaucracy||the executive selects ministers or secretaries of state to control departments such as the health department or the department of justice||in many jurisdictions the head of state does not take part in the day-to-day governance of the jurisdiction and takes a largely ceremonial role||this is the case in many commonwealth nations where the head of state usually a governor almost exclusively acts on the advice of the head of the executive e.g||the prime minister first minister or premier||the primary legal role of the head of state in these jurisdictions is to act as a check or balance against the executive as the head of state has the rarely exercised power to dissolve the legislature call elections and dismiss ministers.||the police enforce the criminal laws by arresting people suspected of breaking the law||bureaucrats are the government workers and government organizations that do work for the government||bureaucrats work within a system of rules and they make their decisions in writing||lawyers are people who have learned about laws||lawyers give people advice about their legal rights and duties and represent people in court||to become a lawyer a person has to complete a two- or three-year university program at a law school and pass an entrance examination||lawyers work in law firms for the government for companies or by themselves||civil society is the people and groups that are not part of government that try to protect people against human rights abuses and try to protect freedom of speech and other individual rights||organizations that are part of civil society include political parties debating clubs trade unions human rights organizations newspapers and charities||corporations are among the organizations that use the legal system to further their goals||like the others they use means such as campaign donations and advertising to persuade people that they are right||corporations also engage in commerce and make new things such as automobiles vaporisers/e-cigarettes and unmanned aerial vehicles i.e||drones that the old laws are not well equipped to deal with||corporations also makes use of a set of rules and regulations to ensure their employees remain loyal to them usually presented in a legal contract and that any disobedience towards these rules are considered uncivilized and therefore given grounds for immediate dismissal.||constitution ethics legal rights parliament physical law political economy||plato listed five kinds of government in the republic:||the most common type of government in the western world is called democracy||in democracies people in a country can vote during elections for representatives or political parties that they prefer||the people in democracies can elect representatives who will sit on legislatures such as the parliament or congress||political parties are organizations of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed||different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems||democracy is the government of the people by the people and for the people||however many countries have forms of democracy which limit freedom of choice by the voters||one of the most common ways is to limit which parties who can for parliament or limit the parties access to mass media such as television||another way is to rig the voting system by removing votes from opposition voters and substituting votes for the party in power||few countries are textbook democracies and the differences between them has been much studied.||a monarchy is a government ruled by a king or a queen who inherits their position from their family which is often called the royal family||there are two types of monarchies: absolute monarchies and constitutional monarchies||in an absolute monarchy the ruler has no limits on their wishes or powers||in a constitutional monarchy a ruler's powers are limited by a document called a constitution||in modern times monarchies still exist in great britain and the commonwealth the netherlands spain japan saudi arabia and thailand along with several other countries||a monarch may have one of several titles: king or queen emperor or empress or emir.||an aristocracy is a government by the best people usually people who come from wealthy families families with a particular set of values or people who come from a particular place||a person who rules in an aristocracy is an aristocrat||aristocracy is different from nobility in that nobility means that one bloodline would rule an aristocracy would mean that a few or many bloodlines would rule or that rulers be chosen in a different manner.||under a dictatorship the government is run by one person who has all the power over the people in a country||originally the roman republic made dictators to lead during time of war||the roman dictators and greek tyrants were not always cruel or unkind but they did hold on to power all by themselves rather than sharing power with the people||the roman dictators only held power for a short period of time||in modern times a dictator's rule is not stopped by any laws constitutions or other social and political institutions and can last many years or even decades||after world war ii many governments in latin america asia and africa were ruled by dictators||examples of dictators include josef stalin adolf hitler augusto pinochet idi amin muammar al-qaddafi and gamal abdul nasser||the rules of these dictators continued from when they took power until when they died because they would not allow any other person or law to take power from them||there is no evidence of a woman serving as a dictator in modern times.||an oligarchy is a government ruled by a small group of powerful people||these people may spread power equally or not equally||an oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things||an oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or passed down from father to son||an oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several powerful people||some past examples of oligarchy are the former union of soviet socialist republics and apartheid south africa||a fictional example is the dystopian society of oceania in the book nineteen eighty-four||some critics of representative democracy think of the united states as an oligarchy||this view is shared by anarchists.||the simplest idea of government is those who rule over people and land||this may be as small as a community or village or as big as a continent like australia and india||the people who rule can allow others to own land||it is a deed by government that gives this right in the way that laws describe||some think they have the right to hold land without government permission||this view is called libertarianism||others think they can do without government||this view is called anarchism||almost every place on earth is connected to one and only one government||places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules small border disputed areas and the continent of antarctica because almost no people live there||for every other place on earth there is a government that claims 'sovereign control' over it||the word sovereign is old and means control by a king sovereign||governments of villages cities counties and other communities are subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist and then to that of the country||it is from kings and feudalism that modern governments and nation states came||the capital of a country for instance is where the king kept his assets||from this we get the modern idea of capital in economics||a government may regulate trade as well as to rule over land||governments also control people and decide things about what morality to accept or punish||in many countries there are strict rules about sexual intercourse and drugs which are part of law and offenders are punished for disobeying them||tax is how government is paid for in most countries||people who buy sell import invest own a house or land or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government||there are many theories of how to organize government better||these are called theories of civics||many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy||that way they can be replaced at election||many governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power||there are many theories of how to run a government better and keep people from hurting each other||these theories are part of politics.||constitution constitutional economics law legal rights political economy local government

inmates can often travel out of the prison||these are used for prisoners who have been convicted of minor crimes or who will soon be released||the united nations made the standard minimum rule for human treatment for prisoners in ||also the article of international covenant on civil and political rights also affirm the treatment with humanity for them in prison||in some prisons people imprisoned for child sexual abuse are separated from other prisoners for their own safety.||there are four main ideas about what prisons should be used for: rehabilitation: prisons should be places that turn the prisoners into good people||deterrence: people should be scared by the thought of going to prison so they will not want to commit crimes||incapacitation: locking criminals up stops them from committing more crimes||retribution: by forcing them to spend time in prison society is taking revenge against people who break the law.||a person who has been charged with a crime but has not yet been convicted for it in a court may be sent to prison if: the court thinks that the person may not come to their trial the court thinks that the person may be a danger to the community or mainly in the us the court has asked for bail money but the person cannot pay the amount.in some parts of the us a person who is arrested may be held at a county jail until they decide whether to charge or release the person||in other places a person who is arrested will be held at a police station not a prison.||male and female inmates are usually kept in separate locations and often in separate prisons||there are special prisons for people under the age of who commit crimes||these inmates are called young offenders or juvenile offenders||these places will not always have the word prison in their name instead having names like young offenders' institution.||prisons are a controversial topic that people have different views about||people who think that we should have prisons say that removing people who commit crimes from society prevents them from committing more crimes and punishes them for their behavior||they also say that putting people in prison may also prevent others who are likely to commit similar crimes from committing them.people who think that we should not put people in prisons say that being put in prison makes people more violent and angry||people who commit minor crimes that are sent to prison meet violent criminals||as well when people are sent to prison they cannot see their family or children which can cause problems for their family||sometimes people are put in prison who have done nothing wrong||an american theory that is critical of prisons is called the prison industrial complex||people who believe in the prison industrial complex think that private prison companies want lots of people to be put in prison in order to make money.||as of there are currently nine million people in prison in the world||the united states currently has the most

certain medical procedures||anaesthesiologists also provide pre-operative assessments ensuring the patient is safe during the operation and successfully awakens from anaesthesia after the operation||they assess for medical conditions and suitability for anaesthesia||they screen for risk factors prior to surgery and try to optimize the operative environment for the patient and the surgeon||they are the doctors who give epidurals during labor and delivery provide spinal blocks local nerve blocks and general anaesthesia for procedures||they are the doctors who are especially trained in intubation putting a tube into the lungs to help a person artificially breathe when the person is paralyzed and asleep during surgery||hence due to their skill in intubation they are often the first line responders for emergencies||they help people who are in distress with their breathing who have lost their airway or when their airway has become obstructed.||a cardiologist is a doctor with special training on the heart||the doctor in this field ensures the heart is healthy and functions properly||the heart is a vital organ whose role is to pump blood to the rest of the body||the purpose of blood is to deliver oxygen to the tissues||without the heart functioning well our tissues and organs would die and not function properly||cardiologists treat heart attacks sudden cardiac arrests arrhythmias rhythm issues related to a faulty electrical system of the heart heart failure where the heart fails to pump blood forward properly and many other heart related illnesses||they specialize in life saving procedures like cardiac stents and cardiac ablation||there is a subspecialty within cardiology called interventional cardiology||these are cardiologists who specialize in interventions or procedures to save the function of the heart such as cardiac stenting or angiography.||this specialty consists of well trained doctors who practice cardiac surgery||they are best known for their role in cardiac bypass surgeries||in cardiac bypass the surgeon restores blood flow to the area of the heart that was deficient due to a blocked coronary artery||this is usually done by taking a vein most commonly the saphenous vein from the leg to create a pathway of blood flow to the heart region that needs it.||emergency room doctors are in charge of sudden important or life-threatening emergencies||in addition to dealing with heart attacks strokes traumas issues that require immediate medical attention or surgeries they also deal with a wide range of other health conditions such as mental health and drug overdoses||their training is broad and diverse as anyone can walk through the door seeking help||they see patients of all ages and walks of life||however unlike a general practitioner or family doctor their immediate goal is to make sure the patient is stable and exclude any serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.||a family doctor otherwise known as general practitioner is trained to provide medical service to people of all ages demographics and walks of life||their training is diverse to deal with a variety of conditions including all non surgical specialties||they also follow the patient from birth to death and are trained to treat an individual as a whole in the context of their social setting and also their family situation and mental health||unlike specialists who mainly deal with problems of one organ or system family doctors deal with all parts of the body and synthesize this information for the patient's general health||they provide a global perspective of the person's health in the patient's unique life situation||they are an individual's regular doctor who knows the patient in their social and family context||they can refer to specialists for issues that require more detailed or specialized treatments unavailable to them as an outpatient or beyond their expertise.||gastroenterologists are doctors who specialize in the gastrointestinal gi tract and upper abdominal organs||the gi tract is consists of the esophagus all the way down to the anus||the upper abdominal organs include the liver gallbladder pancreas and spleen||in addition to dealing with medical conditions associated with these organs doctors in this speciality also perform endoscopies||this is where a camera is placed to visualize the esophagus and stomach upper endoscopy or the colon lower endoscopy or colonoscopy||gastroenterologists that specialize in the liver is called a hepatologist||they are responsible for treating patients with liver failure or cirrhosis||they also treat patients with viral hepatitis abc and many other forms of liver disease.||doctors in this specialty are trained to recognize and treat a variety of different conditions involving the internal organs||they have wide knowledge in a number of specialties including but not limited to: respirology nephrology gastroenterology cardiology||doctors who practice broadly in this field are known as general internists or general internal medicine doctors||internists can go to receive further training beyond residency in a particular field||for example gastroenterologists are internists that have chosen to specialize in gi medicine||internal medicine doctors are in charge of inpatient units when patients are admitted for a general reason||unlike family doctors and emergency doctors although their training is diverse and they have broad knowledge in many organ systems they do not treat or manage children babies or pregnant women||those patients are instead cared for by pediatricians and obstetrics/gynecology respectively.||doctors in this field abbreviated obgyn or obs/gyn specialize in women's health covering conditions of the female reproductive organs and pregnancy care and delivery||some examples of gynecological issues they deal with include contraceptive medicine fertility workup and treatments

field also practice obstetrical medicine specialising in maternal fetal care and deliveries complications related to deliveries assisted deliveries such as vacuum and forceps deliveries and caesarian sections.||this medical specialty consists of well trained doctors who recognize and treat medical conditions associated with the eyes.||health||a disease can be caused by many things||sometimes germs enter our body through food water or air||a person can be infected by infectious agents like bacteria viruses or fungus||disease can also be caused by eating bad or old foods||there are small germs in old foods that can cause diseases||sometimes the germs produce chemicals or toxins which causes the disease||one of the most common causes of disease is poor sanitation and lack of clean water||some deadly diseases like malaria in tropical parts of the world are spread by a mosquito||animals that spread disease are called vectors||there are many vectors including snails ticks and fleas||some people are born with 'genetic diseases'||these are diseases because of an error or mutation in a person's dna||an example of a mutation is cancer||living or working in an unhealthy environment can also be a cause for diseases||diseases are more common in older people.||some diseases can be helped with medicine||infections can often be cured by antibiotics though resistance to antibiotics is a problem||some disease may be helped by surgery||not every disease can be helped with medicine or surgery though||some diseases must be treated during the whole life they are chronic long-lasting diseases||an example of a chronic disease is diabetes mellitus||diabetes can be treated made better but it can not yet be cured made to totally go away||people who usually treat diseases are called doctors or physicians.||some diseases that are common or very bad are tested for even in people who are healthy||if these diseases are found early they can be treated before they cause problems||an example would be checking a woman for cervical cancer with a test called a pap smear||if cervical cancer is found early it can be cured||if it is found later it usually causes death||another example is immunization||the basic of it is to make the body ready for a disease||the body has its own defense against disease called the immune system||one special characteristic of the immune system is its ability to remember||if a person had been sick before and had recovered the immune system produce a substance called antibodies which fight the disease if it comes back to the person||the antibody is specific to a particular disease or antigen||an example of this is measles which is a virus||a person usually a child who had never been sick with measles is given a milder form of the virus this cause the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus||if this person is exposed to the same virus in the future the person's immune system will remember and will fight the virus||for general prevention to be useful: the disease must be found and stopped in early stage||the disease should be common or be easy to recognize||the test for the disease should be easy work all the time and not hurt people||the society is well-trained and can recognize most common symptoms on some diseases||the treatment for the disease should be safe and be easy for people to get.||epidemiology is the study of the cause of disease||some diseases are more popular for people with common characteristics like similar origins sociological background food or nationality||without good epidemiological research some diseases can be hard to track and to name||some diseases can be taken for something else||this is why epidemiology takes a huge part in understanding how to protect ourselves against viruses toxins and bacteria.||health healthy lifestyle viruses == references ==||there is no easy way to be sure when clothing was first developed because it was prehistoric and clothing is perishable||some information comes from studying lice||the body louse lives in clothing and diverged from head lice about years ago||this suggests that clothing existed at that time||another theory is that modern humans are the only survivors of several species of primates who may have worn clothes and that clothing may have been used as long ago as thousand years ago||other louse-based estimates

item was||the items that had higher value and low weight travelled the farthest gold silk etc..||and items that were heavier and worth less would travel mostly short distances||food for example would mostly travel only within a few villages||during the high middle ages wealth began to return and consumers began to demand luxuries again||silk porcelain spices incense gold and gems all travelled thousands of miles across deserts mountains and plains||glass was in turn imported from europe to east||trade was greatly interrupted several times during the crusades - due to the aggression between muslims and europeans and because of mongolian invasions and later because of the black plague||it is thought that the mongols brought the plague with them from asia and devastated the world population from -||almost a third of the world's population was killed by the plague at this time although the americas were not touched by the disease at all.||buddhism is a non-theistic religion in other words buddhists don't believe in a god that is based on philosophy||it began in india but is almost entirely gone from that area now||muslim invaders of the mughal dynasty drove out this system

kingdom||when biologists look at animals they find things that certain animals have in common||they use this to group the animals in a biological classification||they think several million species exist but they have only identified about one million||animals can mainly be divided into two main groups: the invertebrates and the vertebrates||vertebrates have a backbone or spine invertebrates do not||vertebrates are: fish or 'fishes': both ways are correct amphibians reptiles birds mammalssome invertebrates are: insects spiders crustaceans molluscs like a snail or squid worms jellyfishin scientific usage humans are considered animals in everyday nonscientific usage humans are often not considered to be animals.||the animal mode of nutrition is called heterotrophic because they get their food from other living organisms||some animals eat only plants they are called herbivores||other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores||animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores||the environments animals live in vary greatly||by the process of evolution animals adapt to the habitats they live in||a fish is adapted to its life in water and a spider is adapted to a life catching and eating insects||a mammal living on the savannahs of east africa lives quite a different life from a sea mammal like a dolphin or porpoise catching fish in the sea||the fossil record of animals goes back about million years to the ediacaran period or somewhat earlier||during the whole of this long time animals have been constantly evolving so that the animals alive on earth today are very different from those on the edges of the sea-floor in the ediacaran||the study of ancient life is called palaeontology.||list of animal phyla == references ==||in fiction there are always characters||there is usually a protagonist or hero||sometimes this is a group of people not one person||you usually support the hero or heroes||the protagonist has to face some kind of enemy usually another character called the antagonist||the fight between the protagonist and their enemy is called the conflict.||plot is a literary term||it is the events that make up a story particularly as they relate to one another||the events may form a pattern||that pattern may be a sequence through cause and effect or how the reader views the story or simply by coincidence.||in his poetics aristotle considered plot mythos the most important element of drama—more important than character for example||a plot must have aristotle says a beginning a middle and an end and the events of the plot must causally relate to one another as being either necessary or probable||of the utmost importance to aristotle is the plot's ability to arouse emotion in the psyche of the audience||in tragedy the emotions are fear and pity emotions which he considers in his rhetoric.||gustav freytag considered plot a narrative structure that divided a story into five parts like the five acts of a play||these parts are: exposition of the situation rising action through conflict climax or turning point falling action and resolution.||the climax is the most dangerous and exciting part of the plot||for example if you were on a rollercoaster the highest part would be the climax||the climax usually near to the end of the story because the whole story has been building up to it rising action||in an action drama it is the point when the hero or heroine looks like s/he is about to lose and is in the greatest danger.||conflict is very important in fiction||every work of fiction needs a conflict or problem||there are five basic types of conflict||in modern times a new one person vs||technology has been used.||person vs||self is when a character is facing his own fears confusion or philosophy||sometimes the character tries to find out who he or she is and comes to realize it or change it||sometimes the character struggles to find out what is right or wrong||although the enemy is inside the character they can be influenced by outside forces||the struggle of the human being to come to a decision is the base of this type of conflict.||person vs||person is when the hero is fighting another person||there is usually more than one time that the hero meets the enemy||for example if a child is being bullied that is person vs||person conflict||an example is the conflict between judah and messala in ben-hur.||person vs||society is when the hero's main source of conflict is traditions or ideas||the protagonist is basically fighting what is wrong with the world he lives in||society itself is often treated as a single character just as another person is in person vs||person conflict||an example in literature would be wuthering heights by emily brontë.||person vs||nature is when a character is fighting against forces of nature||many films focus on this theme||it is also found in stories about trying to survive in places far away from humans like jack london's short story to build a fire.||person vs||supernatural is when a character is battling supernatural forces||sometimes this force is inside themselves it is internal||such stories are sometimes used to represent or criticize freud's theory of id vs||superego||bram stoker's dracula is a good example of this as well as frankenstein by mary shelley and christabel by samuel coleridge||it is also very common in comic books.||person vs||machine/technology places a character against robot forces with artificial intelligence||i robot and the terminator series are good examples of this conflict||== references ==||the prime purpose of a library is to provide access to knowledge and information||to fulfil this mission libraries preserve a valuable record of culture||then they pass

wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to address the definition of the word game||in his philosophical investigations wittgenstein demonstrated that the elements parts of games such as play rules and competition all fail to correctly define what games are||he concluded that people apply the term game to a range of different human activities that are only related a little bit.||french sociologist roger caillois in his book les jeux et les hommes games and men said that a game is an activity which is these things: fun: the activity is fun to do separate: the activity cannot happen everywhere or all the time uncertain: the people doing the activity do not know how it will end non-productive: doing the activity does not make or do anything useful governed by rules: the activity has rules that are different from everyday life fictitious: the people doing the activity know that the game is not reality||computer game designer chris crawford tried to define the word game using a series of comparisons: something creative is art if it was made because it is beautiful and entertainment if it was made for money||this is the least rigid of his definitions||crawford acknowledges that he often chooses a creative path over conventional business wisdom which is why only one of his games is a sequel||something that is entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive||movies and books are entertainment but not interactive||if a plaything does not have any goals to complete it is a toy||crawford notes that by his definition a a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules and b the sims and simcity are toys not games||if a plaything has goals it is a challenge||if a challenge does not have an enemy it is a puzzle||if it has an enemy or enemies it is a conflict||crawford admits that this is a subjective test||video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in pac-man||if the player can only do better at something than an enemy and cannot hurt the enemy or slow him down the conflict is a competition||racing and figure skating are competitions||however if attacks are allowed then the conflict qualifies as a game.crawford's definition of a game is: an interactive goal-oriented activity with enemies to play against and where players and enemies can interfere with each other.||homo ludens playing man is a book written in by dutch historian johan huizinga||it discusses the importance of the play element in culture and

of lydia demonstrated patience and hoped that the good times of plenty would return||but when things failed to get better the people of lydia thought up a strange solution for their problem||the path they took to fight their natural need to eat – the hungry times caused by the unusually hard climate - was to play games for one entire day so that they would not think about food||on the next day
