differences of opinion regarding the slavery of africans and african americans ultimately led to the american civil war,complex
initially states entering the union had alternated between slave and free states keeping a sectional balance in the senate while free states outstripped slave states in population and in the house of representatives,complex
but with additional western territory and more free-soil states tensions between slave and free states mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories whether and how to expand or restrict slavery,complex

youtube was founded by chad hurley steve chen and jawed karim who were all early employees of paypal,complex
hurley had studied design at indiana university of pennsylvania and chen and karim studied computer science together at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign,complex
according to a story that has often been repeated in the media hurley and chen developed the idea for youtube during the early months of after they had experienced difficulty sharing videos that had been shot at a dinner party at chen 's apartment in san francisco,complex
karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred but chen commented that the idea that youtube was founded after a dinner party was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible,complex
karim said the inspiration for youtube first came from janet jackson 's role in the super bowl incident when her breast was exposed during her performance and later from the indian ocean tsunami,complex
karim could not easily find video clips of either event online which led to the idea of a video sharing site,complex

in general the details of aristotle 's life are not well-established,complex
the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points,complex
aristotle whose name means the best purpose in ancient greek was born in bc in stagira chalcidice about km miles east of modern-day thessaloniki,complex
his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon,complex
both of aristotle 's parents died when he was about thirteen and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian,complex
although little information about aristotle 's childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy,complex
at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato 's academy,complex
he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in / bc,complex
the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy 's direction after control passed to plato 's nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the anti-macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died,complex
aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor,complex
after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon,complex
while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermias 's adoptive daughter or niece,complex
she bore him a daughter whom they also named pythias,complex
in bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander,complex
aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon,complex
during aristotle 's time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings : ptolemy and cassander,complex
aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotle 's own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric,complex
in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants,complex
by bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum,complex
aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years,complex
while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him a son whom he named after his father nicomachus,complex
according to the suda he also had an erômenos palaephatus of abydus,complex
this period in athens between and bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works,complex
he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived,complex
those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students,complex
his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics on the soul and poetics,complex
aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre,complex
near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander 's relationship with persia and persians,complex
a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexander 's death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death,complex
following alexander 's death anti-macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled,complex
in bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mother 's family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated : i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy – a reference to athens 's trial and execution of socrates,complex
he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife,complex
,complex
with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until th-century advances in mathematical logic,complex
kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion,complex
what we today call aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism methods of logical argument aristotle himself would have labelled analytics,complex
the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics,complex
most of aristotle 's work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers,complex
the logical works of aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the organon around bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers,complex
the books are : categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutationsthe order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle 's writings,complex
it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations,complex
the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu : the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning,complex
the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics,complex
like his teacher plato aristotle 's philosophy aims at the universal,complex
aristotle 's ontology places the universal katholou in particulars kath ' hekaston things in the world whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate,complex
this means that aristotle 's epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these,complex
for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in a particular substance,complex
aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies on deduction from a priori principles,complex
in aristotle 's terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences,complex
aristotle 's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry,complex
aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science,complex
note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method,complex
for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics b,complex
his practical science includes ethics and politics his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics,complex
the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotle 's works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics,complex
aristotle called it first philosophy and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science physics as the contemplative theoretikē philosophy which is theological and studies the divine,complex
he wrote in his metaphysics a : if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge but if there is some motionless independent thing the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy and it is universal in just this way because it is first,complex
and it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being,complex
aristotle examines the concepts of substance ousia and essence to ti ên einai the what it was to be in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form a philosophical theory called hylomorphism,complex
in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed,complex
for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc,complex
or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely 'covering for bodies and chattels ' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house,complex
the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form,complex
with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption b–a he distinguishes the coming to be from : growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality,complex
the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property,complex
in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form,complex
referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else,complex
for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become a plant,complex
potentially beings can either 'act ' poiein or 'be acted upon ' paschein which can be either innate or learned,complex
for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate – being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise – acting,complex
actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality,complex
some definitions are : merriam-webster dictionary defines statistics as a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection analysis interpretation and presentation of masses of numerical data,complex
statistician arthur lyon bowley defines statistics as numerical statements of facts in any department of inquiry placed in relation to each other,complex
statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection analysis interpretation or explanation and presentation of data or as a branch of mathematics,complex
some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics,complex
while many scientific investigations make use of data statistics is concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty,complex
mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics,complex
mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis linear algebra stochastic analysis differential equations and measure-theoretic probability theory,complex
in applying statistics to a problem it is common practice to start with a population or process to be studied,complex
populations can be diverse topics such as all persons living in a country or every atom composing a crystal,complex
ideally statisticians compile data about the entire population an operation called census,complex
this may be organized by governmental statistical institutes,complex
descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the population data,complex
numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for continuous data types like income while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data like race,complex
when a census is not feasible a chosen subset of the population called a sample is studied,complex
once a sample that is representative of the population is determined data is collected for the sample members in an observational or experimental setting,complex
again descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data,complex
however the drawing of the sample has been subject to an element of randomness hence the established numerical descriptors from the sample are also due to uncertainty,complex
to still draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population inferential statistics is needed,complex
it uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented accounting for randomness,complex
these inferences may take the form of : answering yes/no questions about the data hypothesis testing estimating numerical characteristics of the data estimation describing associations within the data correlation and modeling relationships within the data for example using regression analysis,complex
inference can extend to forecasting prediction and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied it can include extrapolation and interpolation of time series or spatial data and can also include data mining,complex
,complex
when full census data can not be collected statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples,complex
statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models,complex
the idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid-s in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life insurance,complex
to use a sample as a guide to an entire population it is important that it truly represents the overall population,complex
representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole,complex
a major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative,complex
statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures,complex
there are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population,complex
sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory,complex
probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and more generally the properties of statistical procedures,complex
the use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method,complex
the difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is roughly that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples,complex
statistical inference however moves in the opposite direction—inductively inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population,complex
a common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables,complex
there are two major types of causal statistical studies : experimental studies and observational studies,complex
in both types of studies the effect of differences of an independent variable or variables on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed,complex
the difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted,complex
each can be very effective,complex
an experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements,complex
in contrast an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation,complex
instead data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated,complex
while the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies they are also applied to other kinds of data—like natural experiments and observational studies—for which a statistician would use a modified more structured estimation method e,complex
g,complex
difference in differences estimation and instrumental variables among many others that produce consistent estimators,complex
the basic steps of a statistical experiment are : planning the research including finding the number of replicates of the study using the following information : preliminary estimates regarding the size of treatment effects alternative hypotheses and the estimated experimental variability,complex
consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary,complex
statisticians recommend that experiments compare at least one new treatment with a standard treatment or control to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects,complex
design of experiments using blocking to reduce the influence of confounding variables and randomized assignment of treatments to subjects to allow unbiased estimates of treatment effects and experimental error,complex
at this stage the experimenters and statisticians write the experimental protocol that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the primary analysis of the experimental data,complex
performing the experiment following the experimental protocol and analyzing the data following the experimental protocol,complex
further examining the data set in secondary analyses to suggest new hypotheses for future study,complex
documenting and presenting the results of the study,complex
experiments on human behavior have special concerns,complex
the famous hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the hawthorne plant of the western electric company,complex
the researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers,complex
the researchers first measured the productivity in the plant then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity,complex
it turned out that productivity indeed improved under the experimental conditions,complex
however the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness,complex
the hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome in this case worker productivity changed due to observation itself,complex
those in the hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed,complex
an example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer,complex
this type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis,complex
in this case the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers perhaps through a cohort study and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group,complex
a case-control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest e,complex
g,complex
lung cancer are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected,complex
various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement,complex
the psychophysicist stanley smith stevens defined nominal ordinal interval and ratio scales,complex
nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values and permit any one-to-one transformation,complex
ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values but have a meaningful order to those values and permit any order-preserving transformation,complex
interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined but the zero value is arbitrary as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in celsius or fahrenheit and permit any linear transformation,complex
ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined and permit any rescaling transformation,complex
because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements can not be reasonably measured numerically sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables which can be either discrete or continuous due to their numerical nature,complex
such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the boolean data type polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating point computation,complex
but the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented,complex
other categorizations have been proposed,complex
for example mosteller and tukey distinguished grades ranks counted fractions counts amounts and balances,complex
nelder described continuous counts continuous ratios count ratios and categorical modes of data,complex
see also chrisman van den berg,complex
the issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions,complex
the relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations,complex
whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer hand p,complex

consider independent identically distributed iid random variables with a given probability distribution : standard statistical inference and estimation theory defines a random sample as the random vector given by the column vector of these iid variables,complex
the population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters,complex
a statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample but not a function of unknown parameters,complex
the probability distribution of the statistic though may have unknown parameters,complex
consider now a function of the unknown parameter : an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function,complex
commonly used estimators include sample mean unbiased sample variance and sample covariance,complex
the word chemistry comes from alchemy which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry metallurgy philosophy astrology astronomy mysticism and medicine,complex
it is often seen as linked to the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold though in ancient times the study encompassed many of the questions of modern chemistry being defined as the study of the composition of waters movement growth embodying disembodying drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies by the early th century greek-egyptian alchemist zosimos,complex
an alchemist was called a 'chemist ' in popular speech and later the suffix -ry was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as chemistry,complex
the modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the arabic word al-kīmīā الكیمیاء,complex
in origin the term is borrowed from the greek χημία or χημεία,complex
this may have egyptian origins since al-kīmīā is derived from the greek χημία which is in turn derived from the word kemet which is the ancient name of egypt in the egyptian language,complex
alternately al-kīmīā may derive from χημεία meaning cast together,complex
the current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model,complex
traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles atoms molecules substances metals crystals and other aggregates of matter,complex
this matter can be studied in solid liquid or gas states in isolation or in combination,complex
the interactions reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together,complex
such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory,complex
the chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware,complex
however glassware is not central to chemistry and a great deal of experimental as well as applied/industrial chemistry is done without it,complex
a chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances,complex
the basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms,complex
it can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation which usually involves atoms as subjects,complex
the number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal,complex
when the number of atoms on either side is unequal the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay,complex
the type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules known as chemical laws,complex
energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies,complex
chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure phase as well as their chemical compositions,complex
they can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis e,complex
g,complex
spectroscopy and chromatography,complex
scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists,complex
most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines,complex
several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry some of them are :,complex
in chemistry matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume it takes up space and is made up of particles,complex
the particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest mass such as the photon,complex
matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances,complex
the atom is the basic unit of chemistry,complex
it consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud,complex
the nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons together called nucleons while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus,complex
in a neutral atom the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons,complex
the nucleus is dense the mass of a nucleon is appromixately times that of an electron yet the radius of an atom is about times that of its nucleus,complex
the atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element such as electronegativity ionization potential preferred oxidation states coordination number and preferred types of bonds to form e,complex
g,complex
metallic ionic covalent,complex
a chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms known as the atomic number and represented by the symbol z,complex
the mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus,complex
although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number they may not necessarily have the same mass number atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes,complex
for example all atoms with protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of or,complex
the standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic table which orders elements by atomic number,complex
the periodic table is arranged in groups or columns and periods or rows,complex
the periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends,complex
a compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element,complex
the properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements,complex
the standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac,complex
organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system,complex
the names for inorganic compounds are created according to the inorganic nomenclature system,complex
when a compound has more than one component then they are divided into two classes the electropositive and the electronegative components,complex
in addition the chemical abstracts service has devised a method to index chemical substances,complex
in this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its cas registry number,complex
a molecule is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties that is its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances,complex
however this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules which is not true of many substances see below,complex
molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by covalent bonds such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in lone pairs,complex
thus molecules exist as electrically neutral units unlike ions,complex
when this rule is broken giving the molecule a charge the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion,complex
however the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer,complex
charged polyatomic collections residing in solids for example common sulfate or nitrate ions are generally not considered molecules in chemistry,complex
some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons creating radicals,complex
most radicals are comparatively reactive but some such as nitric oxide no can be stable,complex
the inert or noble gas elements helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way,complex
identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water air and many organic compounds like alcohol sugar gasoline and the various pharmaceuticals,complex
however not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust mantle and core of the earth are chemical compounds without molecules,complex
these other types of substances such as ionic compounds and network solids are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se,complex
instead these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance,complex
examples of such substances are mineral salts such as table salt solids like carbon and diamond metals and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite,complex
one of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure,complex
while the structure of diatomic triatomic or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial linear angular pyramidal etc,complex
the structure of polyatomic molecules that are constituted of more than six atoms of several elements can be crucial for its chemical nature,complex
a chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties,complex
a collection of substances is called a mixture,complex
examples of mixtures are air and alloys,complex
the mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance also called chemical amount,complex
the mole is defined as the number of atoms found in exactly,complex
kilogram or grams of carbon- where the carbon- atoms are unbound at rest and in their ground state,complex
the number of entities per mole is known as the avogadro constant and is determined empirically to be approximately,complex
× mol−,complex
molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution and is commonly reported in mol/dm,complex
in addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications chemicals can exist in several phases,complex
for the most part the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications however some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties,complex
a phase is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties over a range of conditions such as pressure or temperature,complex
physical properties such as density and refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase,complex
the phase of matter is defined by the phase transition which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system instead of changing the bulk conditions,complex
sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary in this case the matter is considered to be in a supercritical state,complex
when three states meet based on the conditions it is known as a triple point and since this is invariant it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions,complex
the most familiar examples of phases are solids liquids and gases,complex
many substances exhibit multiple solid phases,complex
for example there are three phases of solid iron alpha gamma and delta that vary based on temperature and pressure,complex
a principal difference between solid phases is the crystal structure or arrangement of the atoms,complex
another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the aqueous phase which is the state of substances dissolved in aqueous solution that is in water,complex
less familiar phases include plasmas bose–einstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials,complex
while most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems which has received attention for its relevance to systems in biology,complex
atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another,complex
according to the online etymology dictionary the word monkey may originate in a german version of the reynard the fox fable published circa,complex
the rules of chess are published by fide fédération internationale des échecs chess 's international governing body in its handbook,complex
rules published by national governing bodies or by unaffiliated chess organizations commercial publishers etc,complex
may differ,complex
fide 's rules were most recently revised in,complex
chess is played on a square board of eight rows called ranks and denoted with numbers to and eight columns called files and denoted with letters a to h,complex
the colors of the squares alternate and are referred to as light and dark squares,complex
the chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand end of the rank nearest to each player,complex
by convention the game pieces are divided into white and black sets and the players are referred to as white and black respectively,complex
each player begins the game with pieces of the specified color which consist of one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns,complex
the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo with each queen on a square of its own color the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark,complex
the player with the white pieces always moves first,complex
after the first move players alternately move one piece per turn except for castling when two pieces are moved,complex
pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent 's piece which is captured and removed from play,complex
with the sole exception of en passant all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent 's piece occupies,complex
a player may not make any move that would put or leave the player 's own king under attack,complex
a player can not pass at each turn one must make a legal move this is the basis for the finesse called zugzwang,complex
if the player to move has no legal move the game is over it is either a checkmate a loss for the player with no legal moves if the king is under attack or a stalemate a draw if the king is not,complex
each chess piece has its own way of moving,complex
in the diagrams the dots mark the squares where the piece can move if there are no intervening pieces of either color,complex
the king moves one square in any direction,complex
the king also has a special move called castling that involves also moving a rook,complex
the rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file but can not leap over other pieces,complex
along with the king a rook is involved during the king 's castling move,complex
the bishop can move any number of squares diagonally but can not leap over other pieces,complex
the queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank file or diagonal but can not leap over other pieces,complex
the knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank file or diagonal thus the move forms an l-shape : two squares vertically and one square horizontally or two squares horizontally and one square vertically,complex
the knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces,complex
the pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied black dots in the diagram or the pawn can capture an opponent 's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file by moving to that square black xs,complex
a pawn has two special moves : the en passant capture and promotion,complex
once in every game each king is allowed to make a special move known as castling,complex
castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook which is on the player 's first rank and then placing the rook on the last square that the king has just crossed,complex
castling is permissible under the following conditions : neither the king nor the rook have previously moved during the game,complex
there can not be any pieces between the king and the rook,complex
the king can not be in check nor can the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces or move to a square where it would result in a check,complex
note that castling is permissible if the rook is attacked or if the rook crosses a square that is attacked,complex
when a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and there is an opponent 's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square then the opponent 's pawn can capture it en passant in passing and move to the square the pawn passed over,complex
this can only be done on the very next move otherwise the right to do so is forfeit,complex
for example in the animated diagram the black pawn advances two squares from g to g and the white pawn on f can take it via en passant on g but only on white 's next move,complex
when a pawn advances to the eighth rank as a part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player 's choice of queen rook bishop or knight of the same color,complex
usually the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen but in some cases another piece is chosen this is called underpromotion,complex
in the animated diagram the pawn on c can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted to an allowed piece,complex
there is no restriction placed on the piece that is chosen on promotion so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game for example two queens,complex
when a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent 's pieces it is said to be in check,complex
a response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack that is not in check,complex
this can involve capturing the checking piece interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen rook or bishop and there is a square between it and the king or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack,complex
castling is not a permissible response to a check,complex
the object of the game is to checkmate the opponent this occurs when the opponent 's king is in check and there is no legal way to remove it from attack,complex
it is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player 's own king in check,complex
in casual games it is common to announce check when putting the opponent 's king in check but this is not required by the rules of the game and is not usually done in tournaments,complex
,complex
games can be won in the following ways : checkmate : the player whose turn it is to move is in check and has no legal move to escape check,complex
resignation : either player may resign conceding the game to the opponent,complex
it is usually considered poor etiquette to play on in a truly hopeless position and for this reason high-level games rarely end in checkmate,complex
win on time : in games with a time control a player wins if the opponent runs out of time even if the opponent has a much superior position as long as the player still has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent,complex
forfeit : a player who cheats or violates the rules of the game or violates the rules specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited,complex
in high-level tournaments players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game even by a matter of seconds receiving a call or text on a cell phone refusing to undergo a drug test refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices and unsporting behavior such as refusing to shake the opponent 's hand,complex
there are several ways games can end in a draw : draw by agreement : draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players,complex
the correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw make a move then start the opponent 's clock,complex
traditionally players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game occasionally even without playing a move in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty,complex
stalemate : the player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in check,complex
threefold repetition of position : this most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage,complex
in this situation either player can claim a draw this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged,complex
the three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid,complex
fide rules make no mention of perpetual check this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition,complex
fifty-move rule : if during the previous moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made either player can claim a draw,complex
there are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than moves before a pawn move or capture is made examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops,complex
historically fide has sometimes revised the -move rule to make exceptions for these endgames but these have since been repealed,complex
some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fifty-move rule,complex
fivefold repetition of position : similar to the threefold-repetition rule but in this case neither player needs to claim the draw thus a tournament director can intervene and declare the game to be drawn,complex
this is a relatively recent addition to the fide rules,complex
seventy-five-move rule : similar to the fifty-move rule however if the final move in the sequence resulted in checkmate this takes precedence,complex
as with the fivefold-repetition rule this applies independently of claims by the players and allows a tournament director to intervene,complex
this rule likewise is a recent addition to the fide rules,complex
insufficient material : if neither player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent for example if a player has only the king and a knight left and the opponent has only the king left checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule,complex
on the other hand if both players have a king and a knight left there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate so this rule does not apply,complex
draw on time : in games with a time control the game is drawn if a player is out of time and the opponent has no theoretical possibility to checkmate the player,complex
chess games may also be played with a time control,complex
if a player 's time runs out before the game is completed the game is automatically lost provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate,complex
the duration of a game ranges from long or classical games which can take up to seven hours even longer if adjournments are permitted to bullet chess under minutes per player for the entire game,complex
intermediate between these are rapid chess games lasting between minutes and two hours per game a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments,complex
time is controlled using a chess clock that has two displays one for each player 's remaining time,complex
analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks which allow for time controls with increments,complex

chess is believed to have originated in eastern india c,complex
– in the gupta empire where its early form in the th century was known as chaturaṅga sanskrit : चतुरङ्ग literally four divisions [ of the military ] – infantry cavalry elephants and chariotry represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn knight bishop and rook respectively,complex
thence it spread eastward and westward along the silk road,complex
the earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby sassanid persia around where the game came to be known by the name chatrang,complex
chatrang was taken up by the muslim world after the islamic conquest of persia – where it was then named shatranj with the pieces largely retaining their persian names,complex
in spanish shatranj was rendered as ajedrez al-shatranj in portuguese as xadrez and in greek as ζατρίκιον zatrikion which comes directly from the persian chatrang but in the rest of europe it was replaced by versions of the persian shāh king which was familiar as an exclamation and became the english words check and chess,complex
the oldest archaeological chess artifacts ivory pieces were excavated in ancient afrasiab today 's samarkand in uzbekistan central asia and date to about with some of them possibly older,complex
the oldest known chess manual was in arabic and dates to – written by al-adli ar-rumi – a renowned arab chess player titled kitab ash-shatranj book of the chess,complex
this is a lost manuscript but referenced in later works,complex
the eastern migration of chess into china and southeast asia has even less documentation than its migration west,complex
the first reference to chess called xiang qi in china comes in the xuán guaì lù 玄怪录 record of the mysterious and strange dating to about,complex
alternatively some contend that chess arose from chinese chess or one of its predecessors although this has been contested,complex
the game reached western europe and russia by at least three routes the earliest being in the th century,complex
by the year it had spread throughout europe,complex
introduced into the iberian peninsula by the muslims in the th century it was described in a famous th-century manuscript covering shatranj backgammon and dice named the libro de los juegos,complex
around the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern europe and around several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today,complex
these modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in italy and spain,complex
pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities,complex
the queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece towards the end of the th century and by the th century had become the most powerful piece consequently modern chess was referred to as queen 's chess or mad queen chess,complex
castling derived from the kings leap usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety was introduced,complex
these new rules quickly spread throughout western europe,complex
the rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early th century,complex
also in the th century the convention that white moves first was established formerly either white or black could move first,complex
finally the rules around castling were standardized – variations in the castling rules had persisted in italy until the late th century,complex
the resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as western chess or international chess particularly in asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent,complex
since the th century the only rule changes have been technical in nature for example establishing the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition,complex
writings about the theory of how to play chess began to appear in the th century,complex
the repetición de amores y arte de ajedrez repetition of love and the art of playing chess by spanish churchman luis ramirez de lucena was published in salamanca in,complex
lucena and later masters like portuguese pedro damiano italians giovanni leonardo di bona giulio cesare polerio and gioachino greco and spanish bishop ruy lópez de segura developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple endgames,complex
the romantic era was characterized by opening gambits sacrificing pawns or even pieces daring attacks and brazen sacrifices,complex
many elaborate and beautiful but unsound move sequences called combinations were played by the masters of the time,complex
the game was played more for art than theory,complex
a profound belief that chess merit resided in the players ' genius rather than inherent in the position on the board pervaded chess practice,complex
in the th century the center of european chess life moved from the southern european countries to france,complex
the two most important french masters were françois-andré danican philidor a musician by profession who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy and later louis-charles mahé de la bourdonnais who won a famous series of matches with the irish master alexander mcdonnell in,complex
centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major european cities like café de la régence in paris and simpson 's divan in london,complex
as the th century progressed chess organization developed quickly,complex
many chess clubs chess books and chess journals appeared,complex
there were correspondence matches between cities for example the london chess club played against the edinburgh chess club in,complex
chess problems became a regular part of th-century newspapers bernhard horwitz josef kling and samuel loyd composed some of the most influential problems,complex
in von der lasa published his and bilguer 's handbuch des schachspiels handbook of chess the first comprehensive manual of chess theory,complex
chess was occasionally criticised in the th century as a waste of time,complex
the first modern chess tournament was organized by howard staunton a leading english chess player and was held in london in,complex
it was won by the german adolf anderssen who was hailed as the leading chess master,complex
his brilliant energetic attacking style was typical for the time,complex
sparkling games like anderssen 's immortal game and evergreen game or morphy 's opera game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art,complex
deeper insight into the nature of chess came with two younger players,complex
american paul morphy an extraordinary chess prodigy won against all important competitors except staunton who refused to play including anderssen during his short chess career between and,complex
morphy 's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks,complex
prague-born wilhelm steinitz beginning in described how to avoid weaknesses in one 's own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent 's position,complex
the scientific approach and positional understanding of steinitz revolutionized the game,complex
steinitz was the first to break a position down into its components,complex
before steinitz players brought their queen out early did not completely develop their other pieces and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king which either succeeded or failed,complex
the level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan,complex
in addition to his theoretical achievements steinitz founded an important tradition : his triumph over the leading german master johannes zukertort in is regarded as the first official world chess championship,complex
steinitz lost his crown in to a much younger player the german mathematician emanuel lasker who maintained this title for years the longest tenure of all world champions,complex
after the end of the th century the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew,complex
some sources state that in the title of chess grandmaster was first formally conferred by tsar nicholas ii of russia to lasker capablanca alekhine tarrasch and marshall but this is a disputed claim,complex
the tradition of awarding such titles was continued by the world chess federation fide founded in in paris,complex
in the women 's world chess championship was established the first to hold the title was czech-english master vera menchik,complex
it took a prodigy from cuba josé raúl capablanca world champion – who loved simple positions and endgames to end the german-speaking dominance in chess he was undefeated in tournament play for eight years until,complex
his successor was russian-french alexander alekhine a strong attacking player who died as the world champion in,complex
he briefly lost the title to dutch player max euwe in and regained it two years later,complex
between the world wars chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called hypermodernists like aron nimzowitsch and richard réti,complex
they advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawns which become objects of attack,complex
after the death of alekhine a new world champion was sought,complex
fide which has controlled the title since then except for one interruption ran a tournament of elite players,complex
the winner of the tournament russian mikhail botvinnik started an era of soviet dominance in the chess world,complex
until the end of the soviet union there was only one non-soviet champion american bobby fischer champion –,complex
botvinnik revolutionized opening theory,complex
previously black strove for equality to neutralize white 's first-move advantage,complex
as black botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning,complex
in the previous informal system of world championships the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match,complex
fide set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches,complex
the world 's strongest players were seeded into interzonal tournaments where they were joined by players who had qualified from zonal tournaments,complex
the leading finishers in these interzonals would go on the candidates stage which was initially a tournament and later a series of knockout matches,complex
the winner of the candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title,complex
a champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later,complex
this system operated on a three-year cycle,complex
botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years,complex
he won the world championship tournament in and retained the title in tied matches in and,complex
in he lost to vasily smyslov but regained the title in a rematch in,complex
in he lost the title to the -year-old latvian prodigy mikhail tal an accomplished tactician and attacking player,complex
botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in,complex
following the event fide abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch and the next champion armenian tigran petrosian a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills held the title for two cycles –,complex
his successor boris spassky from russia champion – won games in both positional and sharp tactical style,complex
the next championship the so-called match of the century saw the first non-soviet challenger since world war ii american bobby fischer who defeated his candidates opponents by unheard-of margins and clearly won the world championship match,complex
in however fischer refused to defend his title against soviet anatoly karpov when fide did not meet his demands and karpov obtained the title by default,complex
fischer modernized many aspects of chess especially by extensively preparing openings,complex
karpov defended his title twice against viktor korchnoi and dominated the s and early s with a string of tournament successes,complex
karpov 's reign finally ended in at the hands of garry kasparov another soviet player from baku azerbaijan,complex
kasparov and karpov contested five world title matches between and karpov never won his title back,complex
in garry kasparov and nigel short broke with fide to organize their own match for the title and formed a competing professional chess association pca,complex
from then until there were two simultaneous world champions and world championships : the pca or classical champion extending the steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of many games and the other following fide 's new format of many players competing in a tournament to determine the champion,complex
kasparov lost his classical title in to vladimir kramnik of russia,complex
the world chess championship in which kramnik beat the fide world champion veselin topalov reunified the titles and made kramnik the undisputed world chess champion,complex
in september he lost the title to viswanathan anand of india who won the championship tournament in mexico city,complex
anand defended his title in the revenge match of and,complex
in magnus carlsen beat anand in the world chess championship,complex
he defended his title the following year again against anand,complex
carlsen confirmed his title in against the russian sergey karjakin and in against the north american fabiano caruana in both occasions by a rapid tiebreaker match after equality in games of classical time control and is the reigning world champion,complex
chess games and positions are recorded using a system of notation most commonly algebraic chess notation,complex
abbreviated or short algebraic notation generally records moves in the format abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved,complex
the pieces are identified by their initials,complex
in english these are k king q queen r rook b bishop and n knight n is used to avoid confusion with king,complex
for example qg means queen moves to the g-file and the th rank that is to the square g,complex
chess literature published in other languages may use different initials to indicate the pieces or figurine algebraic notation fan may be used to avoid language difficulties,complex
to resolve ambiguities one more letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved e,complex
g,complex
ngf means knight from the g-file moves to the square f and re means rook on the first rank moves to e,complex
the letter p for a pawn is not used so that e means pawn moves to the square e,complex
if the piece makes a capture x is inserted before the destination square,complex
thus bxf means bishop captures on f,complex
when a pawn makes a capture the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial and ranks may be omitted if unambiguous,complex
for example exd pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d or exd pawn on the e-file captures a piece somewhere on the d-file,complex
particularly in germany some publications have used : rather than x to indicate a capture but this is now rare,complex
some publications omit the capture symbol altogether so that exd would be rendered simply as ed,complex
if a pawn moves to its last rank achieving promotion the piece chosen is indicated after the move for example eq or e=q,complex
castling is indicated by the special notations - for kingside castling and -- for queenside castling,complex
an en passant capture is sometimes marked with the notation e,complex
p,complex
a move that places the opponent 's king in check usually has the notation added,complex
the notation for a double check is considered obsolete,complex
checkmate can be indicated by,complex
at the end of the game – means white won – means black won and ½–½ indicates a draw,complex
chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols,complex
for example indicates a good move an excellent move ? a mistake ? ? a blunder ? an interesting move that may not be best or ? a dubious move not easily refuted,complex
for example one variation of a simple trap known as the scholar 's mate see animated diagram can be recorded :,complex
e e,complex
qh ? nc,complex
bc nf ? ?,complex
qxf –the text-based portable game notation pgn which is understood by chess software is based on short form english language algebraic notation,complex
until about the majority of english language chess publications used a form of descriptive notation,complex
in descriptive notation files are named according to the piece which occupies the back rank at the start of the game and each square has two different names depending on whether it is from white 's or black 's point of view,complex
for example the square known as e in algebraic notation is k king 's rd from white 's point of view and k king 's th from black 's point of view,complex
when recording captures the captured piece is named rather than the square on which it is captured except to resolve ambiguities,complex
thus scholar 's mate is rendered in descriptive notation :,complex
p-k p-k,complex
q-r ? n-qb,complex
b-b n-b ? ?,complex
qxbp –a few players still prefer descriptive notation but it is no longer recognized by fide,complex
another system is iccf numeric notation recognized by the international correspondence chess federation though its use is in decline,complex
squares are identified by numeric coordinates for example a is and h is,complex
moves are described by the from and to squares and captures are not indicated,complex
for example the opening move,complex
e is rendered as,complex
castling is described by the king 's move only for example for white castling kingside for black castling queenside,complex
chess strategy consists of setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game – for example where to place different pieces – while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver,complex
these two parts of the chess-playing process can not be completely separated because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play,complex
a game of chess is normally divided into three phases : opening typically the first moves when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle then middlegame and last the endgame when most of the pieces are gone kings typically take a more active part in the struggle and pawn promotion is often decisive,complex
in chess tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions – so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or by a computer,complex
the possible depth of calculation depends on the player 's ability,complex
in quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical while in tactical positions with a limited number of forced variations strong players can calculate long sequences of moves,complex
simple one-move or two-move tactical actions – threats exchanges of material and double attacks – can be combined into more complicated combinations sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players,complex
theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers for example pins forks skewers batteries discovered attacks especially discovered checks zwischenzugs deflections decoys sacrifices underminings overloadings and interferences,complex
a forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a combination,complex
brilliant combinations – such as those in the immortal game – are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers,complex
a common type of chess exercise aimed at developing players ' skills is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it,complex
chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for the future play,complex
during the evaluation players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board control of the center and centralization the pawn structure king safety and the control of key squares or groups of squares for example diagonals open files and dark or light squares,complex
the most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides,complex
the point values used for this purpose are based on experience usually pawns are considered worth one point knights and bishops about three points each rooks about five points the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange and queens about nine points,complex
the king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined since its checkmate loses the game,complex
but in practical terms in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook,complex
these basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece e,complex
g,complex
advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares coordination between pieces e,complex
g,complex
a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight or the type of position e,complex
g,complex
knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions,complex
another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure sometimes known as the pawn skeleton or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard,complex
since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position,complex
weaknesses in the pawn structure such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and holes once created are often permanent,complex
care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset for example by the possibility of developing an attack,complex
,complex
a chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game the opening moves,complex
recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the ruy lopez or sicilian defense,complex
they are catalogued in reference works such as the encyclopaedia of chess openings,complex
there are dozens of different openings varying widely in character from quiet positional play for example the réti opening to very aggressive the latvian gambit,complex
in some opening lines the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than moves,complex
professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers as opening theory continues to evolve,complex
the fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar : development : this is the technique of placing the pieces particularly bishops and knights on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game,complex
control of the center : control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent,complex
king safety : it is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities,complex
a correctly timed castling can often enhance this,complex
pawn structure : players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and pawn islands – and to force such weaknesses in the opponent 's position,complex
most players and theoreticians consider that white by virtue of the first move begins the game with a small advantage,complex
this initially gives white the initiative,complex
black usually strives to neutralize white 's advantage and achieve equality or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position,complex
the middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening,complex
there is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed,complex
similarly there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame see start of the endgame,complex
because the opening theory has ended players have to form plans based on the features of the position and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position,complex
the middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur,complex
combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain,complex
middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent 's king,complex
some typical patterns have their own names for example the boden 's mate or the lasker–bauer combination,complex
specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which result in a specific type of pawn structure,complex
an example is the minority attack which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside,complex
the study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames,complex
another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame i,complex
e,complex
simplify,complex
minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending,complex
not every reduction of material is good for this purpose for example if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one the transformation into a bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw even with an advantage of a pawn or sometimes even with a two-pawn advantage,complex
the endgame also end game or ending is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board,complex
there are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame : pawns become more important,complex

the word comedy is derived from the classical greek κωμῳδία kōmōidía which is a compound either of κῶμος kômos revel or κώμη kṓmē village and ᾠδή ōidḗ singing it is possible that κῶμος itself is derived from κώμη and originally meant a village revel,complex
the adjective comic greek κωμικός kōmikós which strictly means that which relates to comedy is in modern usage generally confined to the sense of laughter-provoking,complex
of this the word came into modern usage through the latin comoedia and italian commedia and has over time passed through various shades of meaning,complex
the greeks and romans confined their use of the word comedy to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings,complex
aristotle defined comedy as an imitation of men worse than the average where tragedy was an imitation of men better than the average,complex
however the characters portrayed in comedies were not worse than average in every way only insofar as they are ridiculous which is a species of the ugly,complex
the ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others the mask for instance that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain,complex
in the middle ages the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings,complex
it is in this sense that dante used the term in the title of his poem la commedia,complex
as time progressed the word came more and more to be associated with any sort of performance intended to cause laughter,complex
during the middle ages the term comedy became synonymous with satire and later with humour in general,complex
aristotle 's poetics was translated into arabic in the medieval islamic world where it was elaborated upon by arabic writers and islamic philosophers such as abu bischr and his pupils al-farabi avicenna and averroes,complex
they disassociated comedy from greek dramatic representation and instead identified it with arabic poetic themes and forms such as hija satirical poetry,complex
they viewed comedy as simply the art of reprehension and made no reference to light and cheerful events or to the troubling beginnings and happy endings associated with classical greek comedy,complex
after the latin translations of the th century the term comedy gained a more general meaning in medieval literature,complex
in the late th century many scholars preferred to use the term laughter to refer to the whole gamut of the comic in order to avoid the use of ambiguous and problematically defined genres such as the grotesque irony and satire,complex

starting from bce aristophanes a comic playwright and satirical author of the ancient greek theater wrote comedies of which survive,complex
aristophanes developed his type of comedy from the earlier satyr plays which were often highly obscene,complex
the only surviving examples of the satyr plays are by euripides which are much later examples and not representative of the genre,complex
in ancient greece comedy originated in bawdy and ribald songs or recitations apropos of phallic processions and fertility festivals or gatherings,complex
around bce aristotle in his work poetics stated that comedy originated in phallic processions and the light treatment of the otherwise base and ugly,complex
he also adds that the origins of comedy are obscure because it was not treated seriously from its inception,complex
however comedy had its own muse : thalia,complex
aristotle taught that comedy was generally positive for society since it brings forth happiness which for aristotle was the ideal state the final goal in any activity,complex
for aristotle a comedy did not need to involve sexual humor,complex
a comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character,complex
aristotle divides comedy into three categories or subgenres : farce romantic comedy and satire,complex
on the contrary plato taught that comedy is a destruction to the self,complex
he believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning,complex
in the republic he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter his condition provokes a violent reaction,complex
plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state,complex
also in poetics aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of literature,complex
the other three genres are tragedy epic poetry and lyric poetry,complex
literature in general is defined by aristotle as a mimesis or imitation of life,complex
comedy is the third form of literature being the most divorced from a true mimesis,complex
tragedy is the truest mimesis followed by epic poetry comedy and lyric poetry,complex
the genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to aristotle 's definition,complex
comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or reveals the insignificance of the aims,complex

during the american revolution in the thirteen colonies acting through the second continental congress declared political independence from great britain,complex
the new states were independent of each other as nation states and recognized the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the british,complex
congress desired to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy and negotiated the articles of confederation to establish an alliance between the states,complex
under the articles congress was a central authority without any legislative power,complex
it could make its own resolutions determinations and regulations but not any laws and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens,complex

most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers elected annually by the legislature to a single term only sharing power with an executive council and countered by a strong legislature,complex
new york offered the greatest exception having a strong unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter,complex
it was through the closed-door negotiations at philadelphia that the presidency framed in the u,complex

the presentment clause requires that any bill passed by congress must be presented to the president before it can become law,complex
once the legislation has been presented the president has three options : sign the legislation within ten days excluding sundays – the bill becomes law,complex
veto the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of congress from which it originated expressing any objections – the bill does not become law unless both houses of congress vote to override the veto by a two-thirds vote,complex
take no action on the legislation within the above timeframe – the bill becomes law as if the president had signed it unless congress is adjourned at the time in which case it does not become law a pocket veto,complex
in congress attempted to enhance the president 's veto power with the line item veto act,complex
the legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill particularly any new spending any amount of discretionary spending or any new limited tax benefit,complex
congress could then repass that particular item,complex

george herbert walker bush was born at adams street in milton massachusetts on june to prescott sheldon bush and dorothy walker bush,complex
the bush family moved from milton to greenwich connecticut shortly after his birth,complex
growing up he used the nickname poppy,complex
bush began his formal education at the greenwich country day school in greenwich,complex
beginning in he attended phillips academy in andover massachusetts where he held a number of leadership positions that included president of the senior class secretary of the student council president of the community fund-raising group a member of the editorial board of the school newspaper and captain of both the varsity baseball and soccer teams,complex
the united states formally entered world war ii in december following japan 's surprise attack on pearl harbor in hawaii,complex
six months later bush enlisted into the u,complex
navy immediately after he graduated from phillips academy on his eighteenth birthday,complex
he became a naval aviator taking training for aircraft carrier operations aboard uss sable,complex
after completing the -month course he was commissioned as an ensign in the united states naval reserve at naval air station corpus christi on june just three days before his th birthday which made him the youngest naval aviator to that date,complex
in september he was assigned to torpedo squadron vt- as the photographic officer,complex
the following year his squadron was based in uss san jacinto as a member of air group where his lanky physique earned him the nickname skin,complex
during this time the task force was victorious in one of the largest air battles of world war ii : the battle of the philippine sea,complex
after bush 's promotion to lieutenant junior grade on august san jacinto commenced operations against the japanese in the bonin islands,complex
bush piloted one of four grumman tbm avengers of vt- that attacked the japanese installations on chichijima,complex
his crew for the mission which occurred on september included radioman second class john delaney and lt,complex
jg william white,complex
during their attack the avengers encountered intense anti-aircraft fire bush 's aircraft was hit by flak and his engine caught fire,complex
despite the fire in his aircraft bush completed his attack and released bombs over his target scoring several damaging hits,complex
with his engine ablaze bush flew several miles from the island where he and one other crew member of the tbm bailed out the other man 's parachute did not open,complex
bush waited for four hours in an inflated raft while several fighters circled protectively overhead until he was rescued by the submarine uss finback on lifeguard duty,complex
for the next month he remained in finback and participated in the rescue of other aviators,complex
several of those shot down during the attack were executed and their livers were eaten by their captors,complex

the constitution of ireland provides for a parliamentary system of government under which the role of the head of state is largely a ceremonial one,complex
the president is formally one of three parts of the oireachtas national parliament which also comprises dáil éireann the house of representatives or lower house and seanad éireann the senate or upper house,complex
unlike most parliamentary republics the president is not even the nominal chief executive,complex
rather executive authority in ireland is expressly vested in the government cabinet,complex

the demonym that is the name for the people and adjectival form chinese developed later on the model of portuguese chinês and french chinois,complex
portuguese china is thought to derive from persian chīn چین which may be traced further back to sanskrit cīna चीन,complex
cīna was first used in early hindu scripture including the mahābhārata th century bce and the laws of manu nd century bce,complex
in martino martini suggested that the word china is derived ultimately from the name of the qin dynasty – bc a proposal supported by many later scholars although there are also a number of alternative suggestions,complex
the official name of the modern state is the people 's republic of china chinese : 中华人民共和国 pinyin : zhōnghuá rénmín gònghéguó,complex
the shorter form is china zhōngguó 中国 from zhōng central and guó state a term which developed under the western zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne,complex
it was then applied to the area around luoyi present-day luoyang during the eastern zhou and then to china 's central plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the qing,complex
it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the huaxia people from perceived barbarians,complex
the name zhongguo is also translated as middle kingdom in english,complex

chinese proto-writing existed in jiahu around bce damaidi around bce dadiwan from – bce and banpo dating from the th millennium bce,complex
some scholars have suggested that the jiahu symbols th millennium bce constituted the earliest chinese writing system,complex
according to chinese tradition the first dynasty was the xia which emerged around bce,complex
the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at erlitou henan in,complex
it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period,complex
the succeeding shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records,complex
the shang ruled the plain of the yellow river in eastern china from the th to the th century bce,complex
their oracle bone script from c,complex
bce represents the oldest form of chinese writing yet found and is a direct ancestor of modern chinese characters,complex
the shang were conquered by the zhou who ruled between the th and th centuries bce though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords,complex
many independent states eventually emerged from the weakened zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the -year spring and autumn period only occasionally deferring to the zhou king,complex
by the time of the warring states period of the th–rd centuries bce there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now china each with its own king ministry and army,complex
the warring states period ended in bce after the state of qin conquered the other six kingdoms and established the first unified chinese state,complex
king zheng of qin proclaimed himself the first emperor of the qin dynasty,complex
he enacted qin 's legalist reforms throughout china notably the forced standardization of chinese characters measurements road widths i,complex
e,complex
cart axles ' length and currency,complex
his dynasty also conquered the yue tribes in guangxi guangdong and vietnam,complex
the qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after the first emperor 's death as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion,complex
following a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at xianyang was burned the han dynasty emerged to rule china between bce and ce creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the han chinese,complex
the han expanded the empire 's territory considerably with military campaigns reaching central asia mongolia south korea and yunnan and the recovery of guangdong and northern vietnam from nanyue,complex
han involvement in central asia and sogdia helped establish the land route of the silk road replacing the earlier path over the himalayas to india,complex
han china gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world,complex
despite the han 's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the qin philosophy of legalism in favor of confucianism qin 's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the han government and its successors,complex
after the end of the han dynasty a period of strife known as three kingdoms followed whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the four classics of chinese literature,complex
at its end wei was swiftly overthrown by the jin dynasty,complex
the jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally-disabled emperor the five barbarians then invaded and ruled northern china as the sixteen states,complex
the xianbei unified them as the northern wei whose emperor xiaowen reversed his predecessors ' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects largely integrating them into chinese culture,complex
in the south the general liu yu secured the abdication of the jin in favor of the liu song,complex
the various successors of these states became known as the northern and southern dynasties with the two areas finally reunited by the sui in,complex
the sui restored the han to power through china reformed its agriculture and economy constructed the grand canal and patronized buddhism,complex
however they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war with korea provoked widespread unrest,complex

the tang empire returned control of the western regions and the silk road and made the capital chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center,complex
however it was devastated and weakened by the an shi rebellion in the th century,complex
in the tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable,complex
the song dynasty ended the separatist situation in leading to a balance of power between the song and khitan liao,complex
the song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade,complex
between the th and th centuries the population of china doubled in size to around million people mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern china and the production of abundant food surpluses,complex
the song dynasty also saw a revival of confucianism in response to the growth of buddhism during the tang and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity,complex
however the military weakness of the song army was observed by the jurchen jin dynasty,complex
in emperor huizong of song and the capital bianjing were captured during the jin–song wars,complex
the remnants of the song retreated to southern china,complex
the th century brought the mongol conquest of china,complex
in the mongol leader kublai khan established the yuan dynasty the yuan conquered the last remnant of the song dynasty in,complex
before the mongol invasion the population of song china was million citizens this was reduced to million by the time of the census in,complex
a peasant named zhu yuanzhang overthrew the yuan in and founded the ming dynasty as the hongwu emperor,complex
under the ming dynasty china enjoyed another golden age developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture,complex
it was during this period that zheng he led the ming treasure voyages throughout the world reaching as far as africa,complex
in the early years of the ming dynasty china 's capital was moved from nanjing to beijing,complex
with the budding of capitalism philosophers such as wang yangming further critiqued and expanded neo-confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations,complex
the scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements which together with the famines and defense against japanese invasions of korea – and manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasury,complex
in beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by li zicheng,complex
the chongzhen emperor committed suicide when the city fell,complex
the manchu qing dynasty then allied with ming dynasty general wu sangui overthrew li 's short-lived shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of beijing which became the new capital of the qing dynasty,complex
the qing dynasty which lasted from until was the last imperial dynasty of china,complex
its conquest of the ming – cost million lives and the economy of china shrank drastically,complex
after the southern ming ended the further conquest of the dzungar khanate added mongolia tibet and xinjiang to the empire,complex
the centralized autocracy was strengthened to crack down on anti-qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce the haijin sea ban and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition causing social and technological stagnation,complex
in the mid-th century the dynasty experienced western imperialism in the opium wars with britain and france,complex
china was forced to pay compensation open treaty ports allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals and cede hong kong to the british under the treaty of nanking the first of the unequal treaties,complex
the first sino-japanese war – resulted in qing china 's loss of influence in the korean peninsula as well as the cession of taiwan to japan,complex
the qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died especially in the white lotus rebellion the failed taiping rebellion that ravaged southern china in the s and s and the dungan revolt – in the northwest,complex
the initial success of the self-strengthening movement of the s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the s and s,complex

losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the northern chinese famine of – in which between and million people died,complex
the guangxu emperor drafted a reform plan in to establish a modern constitutional monarchy but these plans were thwarted by the empress dowager cixi,complex
the ill-fated anti-foreign boxer rebellion of – further weakened the dynasty,complex
although cixi sponsored a program of reforms the xinhai revolution of – brought an end to the qing dynasty and established the republic of china,complex
on january the republic of china was established and sun yat-sen of the kuomintang the kmt or nationalist party was proclaimed provisional president,complex
however the presidency was later given to yuan shikai a former qing general who in proclaimed himself emperor of china,complex
in the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own beiyang army he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic,complex
after yuan shikai 's death in china was politically fragmented,complex
its beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless regional warlords controlled most of its territory,complex
in the late s the kuomintang under chiang kai-shek the then principal of the republic of china military academy was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings known collectively as the northern expedition,complex
the kuomintang moved the nation 's capital to nanjing and implemented political tutelage an intermediate stage of political development outlined in sun yat-sen 's san-min program for transforming china into a modern democratic state,complex
the political division in china made it difficult for chiang to battle the communist people 's liberation army pla against whom the kuomintang had been warring since in the chinese civil war,complex
this war continued successfully for the kuomintang especially after the pla retreated in the long march until japanese aggression and the xi'an incident forced chiang to confront imperial japan,complex
the second sino-japanese war – a theater of world war ii forced an uneasy alliance between the kuomintang and the pla,complex
japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population in all as many as million chinese civilians died,complex
an estimated chinese were massacred in the city of nanjing alone during the japanese occupation,complex
during the war china along with the uk the us and the soviet union were referred to as trusteeship of the powerful and were recognized as the allied big four in the declaration by united nations,complex
along with the other three great powers china was one of the four major allies of world war ii and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war,complex
after the surrender of japan in taiwan including the pescadores was returned to chinese control,complex
china emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained,complex
the continued distrust between the kuomintang and the communists led to the resumption of civil war,complex
constitutional rule was established in but because of the ongoing unrest many provisions of the roc constitution were never implemented in mainland china,complex
major combat in the chinese civil war ended in with the communist party in control of most of mainland china and the kuomintang retreating offshore reducing the roc 's territory to only taiwan hainan and their surrounding islands,complex
on september communist party chairman mao zedong proclaimed the establishment of the people 's republic of china,complex
this was followed by a mass celebration in tiananmen square on october which became the new country 's first national day,complex

however remaining kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western china throughout the s,complex
in modern us history studies the founding of prc china is often termed as the loss of china as reflected in us state policy documents of the time which thinkers such as noam chomsky call the beginning of mccarthyism,complex
the regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform which resulted in the execution of between and million landlords,complex
china developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons,complex
the chinese population almost doubled from around million to over million,complex
however the great leap forward a large-scale economic and social reform project resulted in an estimated million deaths between and mostly from starvation,complex
in mao and his allies launched the cultural revolution sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval which lasted until mao 's death in,complex
in october the prc replaced the republic of china in the united nations and took its seat as a permanent member of the security council,complex
after mao 's death the gang of four was quickly arrested and held responsible for the excesses of the cultural revolution,complex
deng xiaoping took power in and instituted significant economic reforms,complex
the communist party loosened governmental control over citizens ' personal lives and the communes were gradually disbanded in favor of working contracted to households,complex
this marked china 's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open-market environment,complex
china adopted its current constitution on december,complex
in the violent suppression of student protests in tiananmen square brought sanctions against the chinese government from various countries,complex
jiang zemin li peng and zhu rongji led the nation in the s,complex
under their administration china 's economic performance pulled an estimated million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of,complex
the country formally joined the world trade organization in and maintained its high rate of economic growth under hu jintao and wen jiabao 's leadership in the s,complex
however rapid growth also severely impacted the country 's resources and environment and caused major social displacement,complex
living standards continued to improve rapidly despite the late-s recession but centralized political control remained tight,complex
preparations for a decadal communist party leadership change in were marked by factional disputes and political scandals,complex
during china 's th national communist party congress in november hu jintao was replaced as general secretary of the communist party by xi jinping,complex
under xi the chinese government began large-scale efforts to reform its economy which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing growth,complex
the xi–li administration also announced major reforms to the one-child policy and prison system,complex

strictly speaking there is no term in chinese which directly corresponds to confucianism,complex
in the chinese language the character rú 儒 meaning scholar or learned or refined man is generally used both in the past and the present to refer to things related to confucianism,complex
the character rú in ancient china had diverse meanings,complex
some examples include to tame to mould to educate to refine,complex
several different terms some of which with modern origin are used in different situations to express different facets of confucianism including : chinese : 儒家 pinyin : rújiā – ru school of thought chinese : 儒教 pinyin : rújiào – ru religion in the sense of ru doctrine traditional chinese : 儒學 simplified chinese : 儒学 pinyin : rúxué – ruology or ru learning chinese : 孔教 pinyin : kǒngjiào – confucius ' doctrine chinese : 孔家店 pinyin : kǒngjiādiàn – kong family 's business a pejorative phrase used in the new culture movement and the cultural revolution,complex
three of them use rú,complex
these names do not use the name confucius at all but instead focus on the ideal of the confucian man,complex
the use of the term confucianism has been avoided by some modern scholars who favor ruism and ruists instead,complex
robert eno argues that the term has been burdened,complex
with the ambiguities and irrelevant traditional associations,complex
ruism as he states is more faithful to the original chinese name for the school,complex
according to zhou youguang 儒 rú originally referred to shamanic methods of holding rites and existed before confucius ' times but with confucius it came to mean devotion to propagating such teachings to bring civilisation to the people,complex
the difficulty of deciphering a word depends on the language,complex

one possible interpretation traced to cicero connects lego read i,complex
e,complex
re again with lego in the sense of choose go over again or consider carefully,complex
the definition of religio by cicero is cultum deorum the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods,complex
julius caesar used religio to mean obligation of an oath when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors,complex
the roman naturalist pliny the elder used the term religio on elephants in that they venerate the sun and the moon,complex
modern scholars such as tom harpur and joseph campbell favor the derivation from ligare bind connect probably from a prefixed re-ligare i,complex
e,complex
re again ligare or to reconnect which was made prominent by st,complex
augustine following the interpretation given by lactantius in divinae institutiones iv,complex
the medieval usage alternates with order in designating bonded communities like those of monastic orders : we hear of the 'religion ' of the golden fleece of a knight 'of the religion of avys',complex
in the ancient and medieval world the etymological latin root religio was understood as an individual virtue of worship in mundane contexts never as doctrine practice or actual source of knowledge,complex
in general religio referred to broad social obligations towards anything including family neighbors rulers and even towards god,complex
religio was most often used by the ancient romans not in the context of a relation towards gods but as a range of general emotions such as hesitation caution anxiety fear feelings of being bound restricted inhibited which arose from heightened attention in any mundane context,complex
the term was also closely related to other terms like scrupulus which meant very precisely and some roman authors related the term supertitio which meant too much fear or anxiety or shame to religio at times,complex
when religio came into english around the s as religion it took the meaning of life bound by monastic vows or monastic orders,complex
the compartmentalized concept of religion where religious things were separated from worldly things was not used before the s,complex
the concept of religion was first used in the s to distinguish the domain of the church and the domain of civil authorities,complex
in the ancient greece the greek term threskeia was loosely translated into latin as religio in late antiquity,complex
the term was sparsely used in classical greece but became more frequently used in the writings of josephus in the first century ce,complex
it was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others to cultic practices,complex
it was often contrasted with the greek word deisidaimonia which meant too much fear,complex
the modern concept of religion as an abstraction that entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines is a recent invention in the english language since such usage began with texts from the th century due to the splitting of christendom during the protestant reformation and globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-european languages,complex
some argue that regardless of its definition it is not appropriate to apply the term religion to non-western cultures,complex
others argue that using religion on non-western cultures distorts what people do and believe,complex
the concept of religion was formed in the th and th centuries despite the fact that ancient sacred texts like the bible the quran and others did not have a word or even a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written,complex
for example there is no precise equivalent of religion in hebrew and judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious national racial or ethnic identities,complex
one of its central concepts is halakha meaning the walk or path sometimes translated as law which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life,complex
even though the beliefs and traditions of judaism are found in the ancient world ancient jews saw jewish identity as being about an ethnic or national identity and did not entail a compulsory belief system or regulated rituals,complex
even in the st century ce josephus had used the greek term ioudaismos which some translate as judaism today even though he used it as an ethnic term not one linked to modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs,complex
it was in the th century that jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to christianity,complex
the greek word threskeia which was used by greek writers such as herodotus and josephus is found in the new testament,complex
threskeia is sometimes translated as religion in today 's translations however the term was understood as worship well into the medieval period,complex
in the quran the arabic word din is often translated as religion in modern translations but up to the mid-s translators expressed din as law,complex
the sanskrit word dharma sometimes translated as religion also means law,complex
throughout classical south asia the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions,complex
medieval japan at first had a similar union between imperial law and universal or buddha law but these later became independent sources of power,complex
throughout the americas native americans never had a concept of religion and any suggestion otherwise is a colonial imposition by christians,complex
though traditions sacred texts and practices have existed throughout time most cultures did not align with western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred,complex
in the th and th centuries the terms buddhism hinduism taoism confucianism and world religions first entered the english language,complex
no one self-identified as a hindu or buddhist or other similar terms before the s,complex
hindu has historically been used as a geographical cultural and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the indian subcontinent,complex
throughout its long history japan had no concept of religion since there was no corresponding japanese word nor anything close to its meaning but when american warships appeared off the coast of japan in and forced the japanese government to sign treaties demanding among other things freedom of religion the country had to contend with this western idea,complex
according to the philologist max müller in the th century the root of the english word religion the latin religio was originally used to mean only reverence for god or the gods careful pondering of divine things piety which cicero further derived to mean diligence,complex
max müller characterized many other cultures around the world including egypt persia and india as having a similar power structure at this point in history,complex
what is called ancient religion today they would have only called law,complex
scholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion,complex
there are however two general definition systems : the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical,complex
religion is a modern western concept,complex
parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages,complex
scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition with some giving up on the possibility of a definition,complex
others argue that regardless of its definition it is not appropriate to apply it to non-western cultures,complex
an increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion,complex
they observe that the way we use the concept today is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the west or even in the west until after the peace of westphalia,complex
the macmillan encyclopedia of religions states : the very attempt to define religion to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life is primarily a western concern,complex
the attempt is a natural consequence of the western speculative intellectualistic and scientific disposition,complex
it is also the product of the dominant western religious mode what is called the judeo-christian climate or more accurately the theistic inheritance from judaism christianity and islam,complex
the theistic form of belief in this tradition even when downgraded culturally is formative of the dichotomous western view of religion,complex
that is the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else between the creator and his creation between god and man,complex
the anthropologist clifford geertz defined religion as a [ … ] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful pervasive and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic,complex
alluding perhaps to tylor 's deeper motive geertz remarked that [ … ] we have very little idea of how in empirical terms this particular miracle is accomplished,complex
we just know that it is done annually weekly daily for some people almost hourly and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it,complex
the theologian antoine vergote took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency,complex
he also emphasized the cultural reality of religion which he defined as [ … ] the entirety of the linguistic expressions emotions and actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings,complex
peter mandaville and paul james intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence spirituality/materialism and sacredness/secularity,complex
they define religion as quote [ … ] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence and in which communion with others and otherness is lived as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time space embodiment and knowing,complex
according to the macmillan encyclopedia of religions there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture : [ … ] almost every known culture [ has ] a depth dimension in cultural experiences [ … ] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life,complex
when more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form,complex
religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form completeness and clarity in accordance with the environing culture,complex
friedrich schleiermacher in the late th century defined religion as das schlechthinnige abhängigkeitsgefühl commonly translated as the feeling of absolute dependence,complex
his contemporary georg wilhelm friedrich hegel disagreed thoroughly defining religion as the divine spirit becoming conscious of himself through the finite spirit,complex
edward burnett tylor defined religion in as the belief in spiritual beings,complex
he argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or idolatry and so on would exclude many peoples from the category of religious and thus has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them,complex
he also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies,complex
in his book the varieties of religious experience the psychologist william james defined religion as the feelings acts and experiences of individual men in their solitude so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine,complex
by the term divine james meant any object that is godlike whether it be a concrete deity or not to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity,complex
the sociologist émile durkheim in his seminal book the elementary forms of the religious life defined religion as a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things,complex
by sacred things he meant things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a church all those who adhere to them,complex
sacred things are not however limited to gods or spirits,complex
on the contrary a sacred thing can be a rock a tree a spring a pebble a piece of wood a house in a word anything can be sacred,complex
religious beliefs myths dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them,complex
echoes of james ' and durkheim 's definitions are to be found in the writings of for example frederick ferré who defined religion as one 's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively,complex
similarly for the theologian paul tillich faith is the state of being ultimately concerned which is itself religion,complex
religion is the substance the ground and the depth of man 's spiritual life,complex
when religion is seen in terms of sacred divine intensive valuing or ultimate concern then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms e,complex
the term spirit means animating or vital principle in man and animals,complex
it is derived from the old french espirit which comes from the latin word spiritus soul courage vigor breath and is related to spirare to breathe,complex
in the vulgate the latin word spiritus is used to translate the greek pneuma and hebrew ruah,complex
the term spiritual matters concerning the spirit is derived from old french spirituel c,complex
which is derived from latin spiritualis which comes from spiritus or spirit,complex
the term spirituality is derived from middle french spiritualité from late latin spiritualitatem nominative spiritualitas which is also derived from latin spiritualis,complex
there is no single widely agreed upon definition of spirituality,complex
surveys of the definition of the term as used in scholarly research show a broad range of definitions with limited overlap,complex
a survey of reviews by mccarroll each dealing with the topic of spirituality gave twenty-seven explicit definitions among which there was little agreement,complex
this impedes the systematic study of spirituality and the capacity to communicate findings meaningfully,complex
sarah bernhardt was born henriette-rosine bernard at rue de l'école-de-médicine in the latin quarter of paris on or october,complex
she was the illegitimate daughter of judith bernard also known as julie and in france as youle a dutch jewish courtesan a prostitute with a wealthy or upper-class clientele,complex
the name of her father is not recorded,complex
according to some sources he was probably the son of a wealthy merchant from le havre,complex
bernhardt later wrote that her father 's family paid for her education insisted she be baptized as a catholic and left a large sum to be paid when she came of age,complex
her mother traveled frequently and saw little of her daughter,complex
she placed the child with a nurse in brittany then in a cottage in the paris suburb of neuilly,complex
when sarah was seven her mother sent her to a boarding school for young ladies in the paris suburb of auteuil paid with funds from her father 's family,complex
there she acted in her first theatrical performance in the play clothilde where she had the role of the queen of the fairies and performed her first of many dramatic death scenes,complex
while sarah was in the boarding school her mother rose to the top ranks of parisian courtesans consorting with politicians bankers generals and writers,complex
her patrons and friends included charles de morny duke of morny the half-brother of emperor napoleon iii and president of the french legislature,complex
at the age of with the sponsorship of morny sarah was admitted to grandchamp an exclusive augustine convent school near versailles,complex
at the convent she performed the part of the archangel raphael in the story of tobias and the angel,complex
she declared her intention to become a nun but did not always follow convent rules she was accused of sacrilege when she arranged a christian burial with a procession and ceremony for her pet lizard,complex
in sarah learned that her father had died overseas,complex
her mother summoned a family council including morny to decide what to do with her,complex
morny proposed that sarah should become an actress an idea that horrified sarah as she had never been inside a theater,complex
morny arranged for her to attend her first theater performance at the comedie française in a party which included her mother morny and his friend alexandre dumas père,complex
the play they attended was brittanicus by jean racine followed by the classical comedy amphitryon by plautus,complex
sarah was so moved by the emotion of the play she began to sob loudly disturbing the rest of the audience,complex
morny and others in their party were angry at her and left but dumas comforted her and later told morny that he believed that she was destined for the stage,complex
the name christopher columbus is the anglicisation of the latin christophorus columbus,complex
his name in ligurian is cristòffa cómbo in italian cristoforo colombo and in spanish cristóbal colón,complex
he was born before october in the territory of the republic of genoa now part of modern italy though the exact location remains disputed,complex
his father was domenico colombo a middle-class wool weaver who worked both in genoa and savona and who also owned a cheese stand at which young christopher worked as a helper,complex
his mother was susanna fontanarossa,complex
bartolomeo giovanni pellegrino and giacomo were his brothers,complex
bartolomeo worked in a cartography workshop in lisbon for at least part of his adulthood,complex
he also had a sister named bianchinetta,complex
columbus never wrote in his native language which is presumed to have been a genoese variety of ligurian his name would translate in the th-century genoese language as christoffa corombo ligurian pronunciation : [ kriˈʃtɔffa kuˈɹuŋbu ],complex
in one of his writings he says he went to sea at the age of,complex
in the columbus family moved to savona where domenico took over a tavern,complex
in the same year christopher was on a genoese ship hired in the service of rené of anjou to support his attempt to conquer the kingdom of naples,complex
some modern historians have argued that he was not from genoa but instead from the aragon region of spain or from portugal,complex
these competing hypotheses have generally been discounted by mainstream scholars,complex
in columbus began his apprenticeship as business agent for the important centurione di negro and spinola families of genoa,complex
later he allegedly made a trip to chios an aegean island then ruled by genoa,complex
in may he took part in an armed convoy sent by genoa to carry valuable cargo to northern europe,complex
he docked in bristol england and galway ireland,complex
in he was possibly in iceland,complex
in the autumn of he sailed on a portuguese ship from galway to lisbon where he found his brother bartolomeo and they continued trading for the centurione family,complex
columbus based himself in lisbon from to,complex
he married filipa moniz perestrelo daughter of the porto santo governor and portuguese nobleman of lombard origin bartolomeu perestrello,complex
in or his son diego columbus was born,complex
between and columbus traded along the coasts of west africa reaching the portuguese trading post of elmina at the guinea coast in present-day ghana,complex
some records report that filipa died sometime around while columbus was away in castile,complex
he returned to portugal to settle her estate and take his son diego with him,complex
he had left portugal for castile in where he found a mistress in a -year-old orphan named beatriz enríquez de arana,complex
it is likely that beatriz met columbus when he was in córdoba a gathering site of many genoese merchants and where the court of the catholic monarchs was located at intervals,complex
beatriz unmarried at the time gave birth to columbus 's natural son fernando columbus in july named for the monarch of aragón,complex
columbus recognized the boy as his offspring,complex
columbus entrusted his older legitimate son diego to take care of beatriz and pay the pension set aside for her following his death but diego was negligent in his duties,complex
ambitious columbus eventually learned latin portuguese and castilian,complex
he read widely about astronomy geography and history including the works of claudius ptolemy cardinal pierre d'ailly 's imago mundi the travels of marco polo and sir john mandeville pliny 's natural history and pope pius ii 's historia rerum ubique gestarum,complex
according to historian edmund morgancolumbus was not a scholarly man,complex
yet he studied these books made hundreds of marginal notations in them and came out with ideas about the world that were characteristically simple and strong and sometimes wrong,complex
throughout his life columbus also showed a keen interest in the bible and in biblical prophecies often quoting biblical texts in his letters and logs,complex
for example part of the argument that he submitted to the spanish catholic monarchs when he sought their support for his proposed expedition to reach the indies by sailing west was based on his reading of the second book of esdras ezra : see esdras : which he took to mean that the earth is made of six parts of land to one of water,complex
towards the end of his life he produced a book of prophecies in which his career as an explorer is interpreted in the light of christian eschatology and of apocalypticism,complex
,complex
under the mongol empire 's hegemony over asia the pax mongolica or mongol peace europeans had long enjoyed a safe land passage the silk road to the indies then construed roughly as all of south and east asia and china which were sources of valuable goods such as spices and silk,complex
with the fall of constantinople to the ottoman turks in the land route to asia became much more difficult and dangerous,complex
portuguese navigators tried to find a sea way to asia,complex
in the florentine astronomer paolo dal pozzo toscanelli suggested to king afonso v of portugal that sailing west would be a quicker way to reach the spice islands cathay and cipangu than the route around africa,complex
afonso rejected his proposal,complex
portuguese explorers under the leadership of king john ii then developed the cape route to asia around africa,complex
major progress in this quest was achieved in when bartolomeu dias reached the cape of good hope in what is now south africa,complex
meanwhile in the s the columbus brothers had picked up toscanelli 's suggestion and proposed a plan to reach the indies by sailing west across the ocean sea i,complex
e,complex
the atlantic,complex
however dias 's discovery had shifted the interests of portuguese seafaring to the southeast passage which complicated columbus 's proposals significantly,complex
washington irving 's biography of columbus popularized the idea that columbus had difficulty obtaining support for his plan because many catholic theologians insisted that the earth was flat,complex
in fact nearly all educated westerners had understood at least since the time of aristotle that the earth is spherical,complex
the sphericity of the earth is also accounted for in the work of ptolemy on which medieval astronomy was largely based,complex
christian writers whose works clearly reflect the conviction that the earth is spherical include saint bede the venerable in his reckoning of time written around ad,complex
in columbus 's time the techniques of celestial navigation which use the position of the sun and the stars in the sky together with the understanding that the earth is a sphere had long been in use by astronomers and were beginning to be implemented by mariners,complex
as far back as the rd century bc eratosthenes had correctly computed the circumference of the earth by using simple geometry and studying the shadows cast by objects at two remote locations,complex
in the st century bc posidonius confirmed eratosthenes 's results by comparing stellar observations at two separate locations,complex
these measurements were widely known among scholars but confusion about the old-fashioned units of distance in which they were expressed led to some debate about the size of the earth,complex
from d'ailly 's imago mundi columbus learned of alfraganus 's estimate that a degree of latitude or a degree of longitude along the equator spanned / miles but did not realize that this was expressed in the arabic mile rather than the shorter roman mile with which he was familiar m,complex
he therefore estimated the circumference of the earth to be about km whereas the correct value is km mi,complex
furthermore most scholars accepted ptolemy 's estimate that eurasia spanned ° longitude rather than the actual ° to the chinese mainland or ° to japan at the latitude of spain,complex
columbus for his part believed the even higher estimate of marinus of tyre which put the longitudinal span of the eurasian landmass at ° leaving only ° of water,complex
he also believed that japan which he called cipangu following marco polo was much larger farther to the east from china cathay and closer to the equator than it is and that there were inhabited islands even farther to the east than japan including the mythical antillia which he thought might lie not much farther to the west than the azores,complex
in this he was influenced by the ideas of florentine astronomer paolo dal pozzo toscanelli who corresponded with columbus in and who also defended the feasibility of a westward route to asia,complex
columbus therefore estimated the distance from the canary islands to japan to be about italian miles km or statute miles,complex
the true figure is now known to be vastly larger : about km,complex
no ship in the th century could have carried enough food and fresh water for such a long voyage and the dangers involved in navigating through the uncharted ocean would have been formidable,complex
most european navigators reasonably concluded that a westward voyage from europe to asia was unfeasible,complex
the catholic monarchs however having completed an expensive war in the iberian peninsula were eager to obtain a competitive edge over other european countries in the quest for trade with the indies,complex
columbus 's project though far-fetched held the promise of such an advantage,complex
though columbus was wrong about the number of degrees of longitude that separated europe from the far east and about the distance that each degree represented he did possess valuable knowledge about the trade winds which would prove to be the key to his successful navigation of the atlantic ocean,complex
during his first voyage in the brisk trade winds from the east commonly called easterlies propelled columbus 's fleet for five weeks from the canary islands to the bahamas,complex
the precise first land sighting and landing point was san salvador island,complex
to return to spain against this prevailing wind would have required several months of an arduous sailing technique called beating during which food and drinkable water would probably have been exhausted,complex
instead columbus returned home by following the curving trade winds northeastward to the middle latitudes of the north atlantic where he was able to catch the westerlies that blow eastward to the coast of western europe,complex
there in turn the winds curve southward towards the iberian peninsula,complex
it is unclear whether columbus learned about the winds from his own sailing experience or if he had heard about them from others,complex
the corresponding technique for efficient travel in the atlantic appears to have been exploited first by the portuguese who referred to it as the volta do mar turn of the sea,complex
columbus 's knowledge of the atlantic wind patterns was however imperfect at the time of his first voyage,complex
by sailing directly due west from the canary islands during hurricane season skirting the so-called horse latitudes of the mid-atlantic columbus risked either being becalmed or running into a tropical cyclone both of which by chance he avoided,complex
in columbus presented his plans to king john ii of portugal,complex
he proposed that the king equip three sturdy ships and grant columbus one year 's time to sail out into the atlantic search for a western route to the orient and return,complex
columbus also requested he be made great admiral of the ocean appointed governor of any and all lands he discovered and given one-tenth of all revenue from those lands,complex
the king submitted columbus 's proposal to his experts who rejected it,complex
it was their considered opinion that columbus 's estimation of a travel distance of miles km was in fact far too low,complex
in columbus again appealed to the court of portugal resulting in john ii again inviting him for an audience,complex
that meeting also proved unsuccessful in part because not long afterwards bartolomeu dias returned to portugal with news of his successful rounding of the southern tip of africa near the cape of good hope,complex
with an eastern sea route to asia apparently at hand king john was no longer interested in columbus 's far-fetched project,complex
columbus traveled from portugal to both genoa and venice but he received encouragement from neither,complex
he had also dispatched his brother bartholomew to the court of henry vii of england to inquire whether the english crown might sponsor his expedition but also without success,complex
columbus had sought an audience from the monarchs ferdinand ii of aragon and isabella i of castile who had united several kingdoms in the iberian peninsula by marrying and were ruling together,complex
on may permission having been granted columbus presented his plans to queen isabella who in turn referred it to a committee,complex
after the passing of much time the savants of spain like their counterparts in portugal replied that columbus had grossly underestimated the distance to asia,complex
they pronounced the idea impractical and advised their royal highnesses to pass on the proposed venture,complex
however to keep columbus from taking his ideas elsewhere and perhaps to keep their options open the catholic monarchs gave him an annual allowance of maravedis and in furnished him with a letter ordering all cities and towns under their domain to provide him food and lodging at no cost,complex
after continually lobbying at the spanish court and two years of negotiations he finally had success in january,complex
ferdinand and isabella had just conquered granada the last muslim stronghold on the iberian peninsula and they received columbus in córdoba in the alcázar castle,complex
isabella turned him down on the advice of her confessor,complex
columbus was leaving town by mule in despair when ferdinand intervened,complex
isabella then sent a royal guard to fetch him and ferdinand later claimed credit for being the principal cause why those islands were discovered,complex
in the april capitulations of santa fe king ferdinand and queen isabella promised columbus that if he succeeded he would be given the rank of admiral of the ocean sea and appointed viceroy and governor of all the new lands he could claim for spain,complex
he had the right to nominate three persons from whom the sovereigns would choose one for any office in the new lands,complex
he would be entitled to percent of all the revenues from the new lands in perpetuity,complex
additionally he would also have the option of buying one-eighth interest in any commercial venture with the new lands and receive one-eighth of the profits,complex
columbus was later arrested in and dismissed from his posts,complex
he and his sons diego and fernando then conducted a lengthy series of court cases against the castilian crown known as the pleitos colombinos alleging that the crown had illegally reneged on its contractual obligations to columbus and his heirs,complex
the columbus family had some success in their first litigation as a judgment of confirmed diego 's position as viceroy but reduced his powers,complex
diego resumed litigation in which lasted until and further disputes continued until,complex
between and columbus completed four round-trip voyages between spain and the americas each voyage being sponsored by the crown of castile,complex
on his first voyage he independently discovered the americas and magnetic declination,complex
these voyages marked the beginning of the european exploration and colonization of the american continents and are thus of enormous significance in western history,complex
columbus always insisted in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary that the lands that he visited during those voyages were part of the asian continent as previously described by marco polo and other european travelers,complex
columbus 's refusal to accept that the lands he had visited and claimed for spain were not part of asia might explain in part why the american continent was named after the florentine explorer amerigo vespucci and not after columbus,complex
on the evening of august columbus departed from palos de la frontera with three ships,complex
the largest was a carrack spanish : nao the santa maría ex-gallega galician,complex
the other two were smaller caravels,complex
the name of one is lost : it is known today only by the nickname pinta which in castilian of the time meant painted one,complex
the santa clara was nicknamed affectionately the niña the little one a pun on the name of her owner juan niño of moguer,complex
the monarchs forced the citizens of palos to contribute to the expedition,complex
the santa maría was owned by juan de la cosa and captained by columbus,complex
the pinta and the niña were piloted by the pinzón brothers martín alonso and vicente yáñez,complex
columbus first sailed to the canary islands which belonged to castile,complex
he restocked provisions and made repairs in gran canaria then departed from san sebastián de la gomera on september for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean,complex
at about : in the morning of october october gregorian calendar new style a lookout on the pinta rodrigo de triana also known as juan rodríguez bermeo spotted land and immediately alerted the rest of the crew with a shout,complex
thereupon the captain of the pinta martín alonso pinzón verified the discovery and alerted columbus by firing a lombard,complex
columbus later maintained that he himself had already seen a light on the land a few hours earlier thereby claiming for himself the lifetime pension promised by ferdinand and isabella to the first person to sight land,complex
columbus called the island in what is now the bahamas san salvador meaning holy savior the natives called it guanahani,complex
exactly which island in the bahamas this corresponds to is unresolved,complex
based on primary accounts and on what one would expect from the geographic positions of the islands given columbus 's course the prime candidates are san salvador island so named in on the theory that it was columbus 's san salvador samana cay and plana cays,complex
the indigenous people he encountered the lucayan taíno and arawak were peaceful and friendly,complex
he called the inhabitants of the lands that he visited indios spanish for indians,complex
noting their gold ear ornaments columbus took some of the arawaks prisoner and insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold,complex
yuri gagarin was born march in the village of klushino near gzhatsk renamed gagarin in after his death,complex
his parents worked on a collective farm : alexey ivanovich gagarin as a carpenter and bricklayer and anna timofeyevna gagarina as a milkmaid,complex
yuri was the third of four children : older brother valentin older sister zoya and younger brother boris,complex
like millions of people in the soviet union the gagarin family suffered during nazi occupation in world war ii,complex
klushino was occupied in november during the german advance on moscow and an officer took over the gagarin residence,complex
the family was allowed to build a mud hut approximately by metres by ft inside on the land behind their house where they spent a year and nine months until the end of the occupation,complex
his two older siblings were deported by the germans to poland for slave labour in and did not return until after the war in,complex
in the family moved to gzhatsk where gagarin continued his secondary education,complex
in gagarin entered into an apprenticeship at age as a foundryman at the lyubertsy steel plant near moscow and also enrolled at a local young workers school for seventh grade evening classes,complex
after graduating in from both the seventh grade and the vocational school with honours in moldmaking and foundry work he was selected for further training at the saratov industrial technical school where he studied tractors,complex
while in saratov gagarin volunteered for weekend training as a soviet air cadet at a local flying club where he learned to fly — at first in a biplane and later in a yak- trainer,complex
he also earned extra money as a part-time dock laborer on the volga river,complex
after he graduated from the technical school in the soviet army drafted gagarin,complex
on a recommendation gagarin was sent to the first chkalov air force pilot 's school in orenburg and soloed in a mig- in,complex
after graduation he was assigned to the luostari airbase in murmansk oblast close to the norwegian border where terrible weather made flying risky,complex
he became a lieutenant in the soviet air forces on november on november he received the rank of senior lieutenant,complex
,complex
in after an extensive search and selection process gagarin was chosen with other pilots for the soviet space program,complex
gagarin was further selected for an elite training group known as the sochi six from which the first cosmonauts of the vostok programme would be chosen,complex
gagarin and other prospective candidates were subjected to experiments designed to test physical and psychological endurance he also underwent training for the upcoming flight,complex
the eventual choices for the first launch were gagarin and gherman titov due to their performance during training sessions as well as their physical characteristics — space was limited in the small vostok cockpit and both men were short,complex
gagarin was,complex
metres ft in tall,complex
in august when gagarin was one of possible candidates a soviet air force doctor evaluated his personality as follows : modest embarrasses when his humor gets a little too racy high degree of intellectual development evident in yuriy fantastic memory distinguishes himself from his colleagues by his sharp and far-ranging sense of attention to his surroundings a well-developed imagination quick reactions persevering prepares himself painstakingly for his activities and training exercises handles celestial mechanics and mathematical formulae with ease as well as excels in higher mathematics does not feel constrained when he has to defend his point of view if he considers himself right appears that he understands life better than a lot of his friends,complex
gagarin was also a favoured candidate by his peers,complex
when the candidates were asked to anonymously vote for which other candidate they would like to see as the first to fly all but three chose gagarin,complex
one of these candidates yevgeny khrunov believed that gagarin was very focused and was demanding of himself and others when necessary,complex
gagarin kept physically fit throughout his life and was a keen sportsman,complex
cosmonaut valery bykovsky wrote : service in the air force made us strong both physically and morally,complex
all of us cosmonauts took up sports and pt seriously when we served in the air force,complex
i know that yuri gagarin was fond of ice hockey,complex
he liked to play goal keeper,complex
i do n't think i am wrong when i say that sports became a fixture in the life of the cosmonauts,complex
in addition to being a keen ice hockey player gagarin was also a basketball fan and coached the saratov industrial technical school team as well as being a referee,complex
on april the vostok ka- vostok spacecraft with gagarin aboard was launched from baikonur cosmodrome,complex
gagarin thus became both the first human to travel into space and the first to orbit the earth,complex
his call sign was kedr russian : кедр siberian pine or cedar,complex
the radio communication between the launch control room and gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch : korolev : preliminary stage,complex
,complex
intermediate,complex
,complex
main,complex
,complex
lift off we wish you a good flight,complex
everything is all right,complex
gagarin : поехали poyekhali—let 's go,complex
gagarin 's informal poyekhali became a historical phrase in the eastern bloc used to refer to the beginning of the space age in human history,complex
in his post-flight report gagarin recalled his experience of spaceflight having been the first human in space : the feeling of weightlessness was somewhat unfamiliar compared with earth conditions,complex
here you feel as if you were hanging in a horizontal position in straps,complex
you feel as if you are suspended,complex
following the flight gagarin told the soviet leader nikita khrushchev that during reentry he had whistled the tune the motherland hears the motherland knows russian : родина слышит родина знает,complex
the first two lines of the song are : the motherland hears the motherland knows/where her son flies in the sky,complex
this patriotic song was written by dmitri shostakovich in opus with words by yevgeniy dolmatovsky,complex
some sources have claimed that gagarin commented during the flight i do n't see any god up here,complex
however no such words appear in the verbatim record of his conversations with earth-based stations during the spaceflight,complex
in a interview gagarin 's friend colonel valentin petrov stated that the cosmonaut never said such words and that the quote originated from nikita khrushchev 's speech at the plenum of the central committee of the cpsu about the state 's anti-religion campaign saying gagarin flew into space but did n't see any god there,complex
petrov also said that gagarin had been baptised into the orthodox church as a child and a foma magazine article quoted the rector of the orthodox church in star city saying gagarin baptized his elder daughter yelena shortly before his space flight and his family used to celebrate christmas and easter and keep icons in the house,complex
gagarin 's flight was a triumph for the soviet space program,complex
the announcement on the soviet radio was made by yuri levitan the same speaker who announced all major events in the great patriotic war,complex
gagarin became a national hero of the soviet union and eastern bloc and a worldwide celebrity,complex
newspapers around the globe published his biography and details of his flight,complex
moscow and other cities in the soviet union held mass demonstrations the scale of which was second only to world war ii victory parades,complex
gagarin was escorted in a long motorcade of high-ranking officials through the streets of moscow to the kremlin where in a lavish ceremony he was awarded the title of hero of the soviet union by nikita khrushchev,complex
later on gagarin toured widely abroad,complex
he visited italy germany canada brazil japan egypt and finland to promote the soviet union 's accomplishment of putting the first human in space,complex
archimedes was born c,complex
bc in the seaport city of syracuse sicily at that time a self-governing colony in magna graecia located along the coast of southern italy,complex
the date of birth is based on a statement by the byzantine greek historian john tzetzes that archimedes lived for years,complex
in the sand reckoner archimedes gives his father 's name as phidias an astronomer about whom nothing else is known,complex
plutarch wrote in his parallel lives that archimedes was related to king hiero ii the ruler of syracuse,complex
a biography of archimedes was written by his friend heracleides but this work has been lost leaving the details of his life obscure,complex
it is unknown for instance whether he ever married or had children,complex
during his youth archimedes may have studied in alexandria egypt where conon of samos and eratosthenes of cyrene were contemporaries,complex
he referred to conon of samos as his friend while two of his works the method of mechanical theorems and the cattle problem have introductions addressed to eratosthenes,complex
archimedes died c,complex
bc during the second punic war when roman forces under general marcus claudius marcellus captured the city of syracuse after a two-year-long siege,complex
according to the popular account given by plutarch archimedes was contemplating a mathematical diagram when the city was captured,complex
a roman soldier commanded him to come and meet general marcellus but he declined saying that he had to finish working on the problem,complex
the soldier was enraged by this and killed archimedes with his sword,complex
plutarch also gives a lesser-known account of the death of archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a roman soldier,complex
according to this story archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items,complex
general marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of archimedes as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he must not be harmed,complex
marcellus called archimedes a geometrical briareus,complex
the last words attributed to archimedes are do not disturb my circles a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the roman soldier,complex
this quote is often given in latin as noli turbare circulos meos but there is no reliable evidence that archimedes uttered these words and they do not appear in the account given by plutarch,complex
valerius maximus writing in memorable doings and sayings in the st century ad gives the phrase as,complex
sed protecto manibus puluere 'noli ' inquit 'obsecro istum disturbare ' -,complex
but protecting the dust with his hands said 'i beg of you do not disturb this,complex
' the phrase is also given in katharevousa greek as μὴ μου τοὺς κύκλους τάραττε mē mou tous kuklous taratte,complex
the tomb of archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof consisting of a sphere and a cylinder of the same height and diameter,complex
archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases,complex
in bc years after his death the roman orator cicero was serving as quaestor in sicily,complex
he had heard stories about the tomb of archimedes but none of the locals were able to give him the location,complex
eventually he found the tomb near the agrigentine gate in syracuse in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes,complex
cicero had the tomb cleaned up and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription,complex
a tomb discovered in the courtyard of the hotel panorama in syracuse in the early s was claimed to be that of archimedes but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown,complex
the standard versions of the life of archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of ancient rome,complex
the account of the siege of syracuse given by polybius in his the histories was written around seventy years after archimedes ' death and was used subsequently as a source by plutarch and livy,complex
it sheds little light on archimedes as a person and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city,complex
,complex
the most widely known anecdote about archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape,complex
according to vitruvius a votive crown for a temple had been made for king hiero ii of syracuse who had supplied the pure gold to be used and archimedes was asked to determine whether some silver had been substituted by the dishonest goldsmith,complex
archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its density,complex
while taking a bath he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in and realized that this effect could be used to determine the volume of the crown,complex
for practical purposes water is incompressible so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume,complex
by dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced the density of the crown could be obtained,complex
this density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added,complex
archimedes then took to the streets naked so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress crying eureka greek : εὕρηκα heúrēka meaning i have found [ it ],complex
the test was conducted successfully proving that silver had indeed been mixed in,complex
the story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of archimedes,complex
moreover the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement,complex
maria skłodowska was born in warsaw in congress poland in the russian empire on november the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers bronisława née boguska and władysław skłodowski,complex
the elder siblings of maria nicknamed mania were zofia born nicknamed zosia józef born nicknamed józio bronisława born nicknamed bronia and helena born nicknamed hela,complex
on both the paternal and maternal sides the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in polish national uprisings aimed at restoring poland 's independence the most recent had been the january uprising of –,complex
this condemned the subsequent generation including maria and her elder siblings to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life,complex
maria 's paternal grandfather józef skłodowski had been a respected teacher in lublin where he taught the young bolesław prus who would become a leading figure in polish literature,complex
władysław skłodowski taught mathematics and physics subjects that maria was to pursue and was also director of two warsaw gymnasia for boys,complex
after russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the polish schools he brought much of the laboratory equipment home and instructed his children in its use,complex
he was eventually fired by his russian supervisors for pro-polish sentiments and forced to take lower-paying posts the family also lost money on a bad investment and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house,complex
maria 's mother bronisława operated a prestigious warsaw boarding school for girls she resigned from the position after maria was born,complex
she died of tuberculosis in may when maria was ten years old,complex
less than three years earlier maria 's oldest sibling zofia had died of typhus contracted from a boarder,complex
maria 's father was an atheist her mother a devout catholic,complex
the deaths of maria 's mother and sister caused her to give up catholicism and become agnostic,complex
when she was ten years old maria began attending the boarding school of j,complex
sikorska next she attended a gymnasium for girls from which she graduated on june with a gold medal,complex
after a collapse possibly due to depression she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father and the next year with her father in warsaw where she did some tutoring,complex
unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman she and her sister bronisława became involved with the clandestine flying university sometimes translated as floating university a polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students,complex
maria made an agreement with her sister bronisława that she would give her financial assistance during bronisława 's medical studies in paris in exchange for similar assistance two years later,complex
in connection with this maria took a position as governess : first as a home tutor in warsaw then for two years as a governess in szczuki with a landed family the żorawskis who were relatives of her father,complex
while working for the latter family she fell in love with their son kazimierz żorawski a future eminent mathematician,complex
his parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative and kazimierz was unable to oppose them,complex
maria 's loss of the relationship with żorawski was tragic for both,complex
he soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician becoming a professor and rector of kraków university,complex
still as an old man and a mathematics professor at the warsaw polytechnic he would sit contemplatively before the statue of maria skłodowska which had been erected in before the radium institute that she had founded in,complex
at the beginning of bronisława—who a few months earlier had married kazimierz dłuski a polish physician and social and political activist—invited maria to join them in paris,complex
maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition it would take her a year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds,complex
she was helped by her father who was able to secure a more lucrative position again,complex
all that time she continued to educate herself reading books exchanging letters and being tutored herself,complex
in early she returned home to her father in warsaw,complex
she continued working as a governess and remained there till late,complex
she tutored studied at the flying university and began her practical scientific training – in a chemical laboratory at the museum of industry and agriculture at krakowskie przedmieście near warsaw 's old town,complex
the laboratory was run by her cousin józef boguski who had been an assistant in saint petersburg to the russian chemist dmitri mendeleev,complex
in late she left poland for france,complex
in paris maria or marie as she would be known in france briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a garret closer to the university in the latin quarter and proceeding with her studies of physics chemistry and mathematics at the university of paris where she enrolled in late,complex
she subsisted on her meager resources suffering from cold winters and occasionally fainting from hunger,complex
skłodowska studied during the day and tutored evenings barely earning her keep,complex
in she was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an industrial laboratory of professor gabriel lippmann,complex
meanwhile she continued studying at the university of paris and with the aid of a fellowship she was able to earn a second degree in,complex
skłodowska had begun her scientific career in paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various steels commissioned by the society for the encouragement of national industry société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale [ ],complex
that same year pierre curie entered her life it was their mutual interest in natural sciences that drew them together,complex
pierre curie was an instructor at the school of physics and chemistry the école supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de paris espci,complex
they were introduced by the polish physicist professor józef wierusz-kowalski who had learned that she was looking for a larger laboratory space something that wierusz-kowalski thought pierre curie had access to,complex
though curie did not have a large laboratory he was able to find some space for skłodowska where she was able to begin work,complex
their mutual passion for science brought them increasingly closer and they began to develop feelings for one another,complex
eventually pierre curie proposed marriage but at first skłodowska did not accept as she was still planning to go back to her native country,complex
curie however declared that he was ready to move with her to poland even if it meant being reduced to teaching french,complex
meanwhile for the summer break skłodowska returned to warsaw where she visited her family,complex
she was still laboring under the illusion that she would be able to work in her chosen field in poland but she was denied a place at kraków university because she was a woman,complex
a letter from pierre curie convinced her to return to paris to pursue a ph,complex
d,complex
at skłodowska 's insistence curie had written up his research on magnetism and received his own doctorate in march he was also promoted to professor at the school,complex
a contemporary quip would call skłodowska pierre 's biggest discovery,complex
on july they were married in sceaux seine neither wanted a religious service,complex
curie 's dark blue outfit worn instead of a bridal gown would serve her for many years as a laboratory outfit,complex
they shared two pastimes : long bicycle trips and journeys abroad which brought them even closer,complex

in wilhelm roentgen discovered the existence of x-rays though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood,complex
in henri becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled x-rays in their penetrating power,complex
he demonstrated that this radiation unlike phosphorescence did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself,complex
influenced by these two important discoveries curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis,complex
she used an innovative technique to investigate samples,complex
galileo was born in pisa then part of the duchy of florence italy on february the first of six children of vincenzo galilei a famous lutenist composer and music theorist and giulia née ammannati who had married in,complex
galileo became an accomplished lutenist himself and would have learned early from his father a scepticism for established authority the value of well-measured or quantified experimentation an appreciation for a periodic or musical measure of time or rhythm as well as the results expected from a combination of mathematics and experiment,complex
three of galileo 's five siblings survived infancy,complex
the youngest michelangelo or michelagnolo also became a noted lutenist and composer although he contributed to financial burdens during galileo 's young adulthood,complex
michelangelo was unable to contribute his fair share of their father 's promised dowries to their brothers-in-law who would later attempt to seek legal remedies for payments due,complex
michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions,complex
these financial burdens may have contributed to galileo 's early desire to develop inventions that would bring him additional income,complex
when galileo galilei was eight his family moved to florence but he was left with jacopo borghini for two years,complex
he was educated from to in the vallombrosa abbey about km southeast of florence,complex
the surname galilei derives from the given name of an ancestor galileo bonaiuti a physician university teacher and politician who lived in florence from to his descendants had changed their family name from bonaiuti or buonaiuti to galilei in his honor in the late th century,complex
galileo bonaiuti was buried in the same church the basilica of santa croce in florence where about years later his more famous descendant galileo galilei was also buried,complex
it was common for mid-sixteenth-century tuscan families to name the eldest son after the parents ' surname,complex
hence galileo galilei was not necessarily named after his ancestor galileo bonaiuti,complex
the italian male given name galileo and thence the surname galilei derives from the latin galilaeus meaning of galilee a biblically significant region in northern israel,complex
because of that region the adjective galilaios greek γαλιλαίος latin galilaeus italian galileo which means galilean has been used in antiquity particularly by emperor julian to refer to christ and his followers after this the adjective has been adopted as a name with a meaning similar to jesus or christian,complex
the biblical roots of galileo 's name and surname were to become the subject of a famous pun,complex
in during the galileo affair one of galileo 's opponents the dominican priest tommaso caccini delivered against galileo a controversial and influential sermon,complex
in it he made a point of quoting acts : ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven ?,complex
despite being a genuinely pious roman catholic galileo fathered three children out of wedlock with marina gamba,complex
they had two daughters virginia born in and livia born in and a son vincenzo born in,complex
because of their illegitimate birth their father considered the girls unmarriageable if not posing problems of prohibitively expensive support or dowries which would have been similar to galileo 's previous extensive financial problems with two of his sisters,complex
their only worthy alternative was the religious life,complex
both girls were accepted by the convent of san matteo in arcetri and remained there for the rest of their lives,complex
virginia took the name maria celeste upon entering the convent,complex
she died on april and is buried with galileo at the basilica of santa croce florence,complex
livia took the name sister arcangela and was ill for most of her life,complex
vincenzo was later legitimised as the legal heir of galileo and married sestilia bocchineri,complex
although galileo seriously considered the priesthood as a young man at his father 's urging he instead enrolled in at the university of pisa for a medical degree,complex
in when he was studying medicine he noticed a swinging chandelier which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs,complex
to him it seemed by comparison with his heartbeat that the chandelier took the same amount of time to swing back and forth no matter how far it was swinging,complex
when he returned home he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together,complex
it was not until the work of christiaan huygens almost one hundred years later that the tautochrone nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece,complex
up to this point galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician,complex
however after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine,complex
he created a thermoscope a forerunner of the thermometer and in published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world,complex
galileo also studied disegno a term encompassing fine art and in obtained the position of instructor in the accademia delle arti del disegno in florence teaching perspective and chiaroscuro,complex
being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the renaissance artists galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality,complex
while a young teacher at the accademia he began a lifelong friendship with the florentine painter cigoli who included galileo 's lunar observations in one of his paintings,complex
in he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in pisa,complex
in his father died and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother michelagnolo,complex
in he moved to the university of padua where he taught geometry mechanics and astronomy until,complex
during this period galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science for example kinematics of motion and astronomy as well as practical applied science for example strength of materials and pioneering the telescope,complex
his multiple interests included the study of astrology which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy,complex
cardinal bellarmine had written in that the copernican system could not be defended without a true physical demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun,complex
galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide the required physical proof of the motion of the earth,complex
this theory was so important to him that he originally intended to entitle his dialogue on the two chief world systems the dialogue on the ebb and flow of the sea,complex
the reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the inquisition,complex
for galileo the tides were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the earth 's surface sped up and slowed down because of the earth 's rotation on its axis and revolution around the sun,complex
he circulated his first account of the tides in addressed to cardinal orsini,complex
his theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides he correctly accounted for instance for the negligible tides halfway along the adriatic sea compared to those at the ends,complex
as a general account of the cause of tides however his theory was a failure,complex
if this theory were correct there would be only one high tide per day,complex
galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at venice instead of one about twelve hours apart,complex
galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes including the shape of the sea its depth and other factors,complex
against the assertion that galileo was deceptive in making these arguments albert einstein expressed the opinion that galileo developed his fascinating arguments and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the earth,complex
galileo dismissed the idea held by his contemporary johannes kepler that the moon caused the tides,complex
galileo also took no interest in kepler 's elliptical orbits of the planets,complex
in galileo became embroiled in a controversy with father orazio grassi professor of mathematics at the jesuit collegio romano,complex
marx was born on may to heinrich marx – and henriette pressburg –,complex
born on october nietzsche grew up in the small town of röcken near leipzig in the prussian province of saxony,complex
he was named after king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia who turned on the day of nietzsche 's birth nietzsche later dropped his middle name wilhelm,complex
nietzsche 's parents carl ludwig nietzsche – a lutheran pastor and former teacher and franziska nietzsche – married in the year before their son 's birth,complex
they had two other children : a daughter elisabeth förster-nietzsche born in and a second son ludwig joseph born in,complex
nietzsche 's father died from a brain ailment in ludwig joseph died six months later at age two,complex
the family then moved to naumburg where they lived with nietzsche 's maternal grandmother and his father 's two unmarried sisters,complex
after the death of nietzsche 's grandmother in the family moved into their own house now nietzsche-haus a museum and nietzsche study centre,complex
nietzsche attended a boys ' school and then a private school where he became friends with gustav krug rudolf wagner and wilhelm pinder all of whom came from highly respected families,complex
in he began to attend domgymnasium in naumburg,complex
because his father had worked for the state as a pastor the now-fatherless nietzsche was offered a scholarship to study at the internationally recognized schulpforta the claim that nietzsche was admitted on the strength of his academic competence has been debunked : his grades were nowhere near the top of the class,complex
he transferred and studied there from to becoming friends with paul deussen and carl von gersdorff,complex
he also found time to work on poems and musical compositions,complex
nietzsche led germania a music and literature club during his summers in naumburg,complex
at schulpforta nietzsche received an important grounding in languages—greek latin hebrew and french—so as to be able to read important primary sources he also experienced for the first time being away from his family life in a small-town conservative environment,complex
his end-of-semester exams in march showed a in religion and german a a in greek and latin a b in french history and physics and a lackluster in hebrew and mathematics,complex
while at pforta nietzsche had a penchant for pursuing subjects that were considered unbecoming,complex
he became acquainted with the work of the then almost-unknown poet friedrich hölderlin calling him my favorite poet and composing an essay in which he said that the mad poet raised consciousness to the most sublime ideality,complex
the teacher who corrected the essay gave it a good mark but commented that nietzsche should concern himself in the future with healthier more lucid and more german writers,complex
additionally he became acquainted with ernst ortlepp an eccentric blasphemous and often drunken poet who was found dead in a ditch weeks after meeting the young nietzsche but who may have introduced nietzsche to the music and writing of richard wagner,complex
perhaps under ortlepp 's influence he and a student named richter returned to school drunk and encountered a teacher resulting in nietzsche 's demotion from first in his class and the end of his status as a prefect,complex
after graduation in september nietzsche commenced studies in theology and classical philology at the university of bonn with hope of becoming a minister,complex
for a short time he and deussen became members of the burschenschaft frankonia,complex
after one semester and to the anger of his mother he stopped his theological studies and lost his faith,complex
as early as his essay fate and history nietzsche had argued that historical research had discredited the central teachings of christianity but david strauss 's life of jesus also seems to have had a profound effect on the young man,complex
in addition ludwig feuerbach 's the essence of christianity influenced young nietzsche with its argument that people created god and not the other way around,complex
in june at the age of nietzsche wrote to his sister elisabeth who was deeply religious a letter regarding his loss of faith,complex
this letter contains the following statement : hence the ways of men part : if you wish to strive for peace of soul and pleasure then believe if you wish to be a devotee of truth then inquire,complex
nietzsche subsequently concentrated on studying philology under professor friedrich wilhelm ritschl whom he followed to the university of leipzig in,complex
there he became close friends with his fellow student erwin rohde,complex
nietzsche 's first philological publications appeared soon after,complex
in nietzsche thoroughly studied the works of arthur schopenhauer,complex
alexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient greek month of hekatombaion which probably corresponds to july bc although the exact date is disputed in pella the capital of the kingdom of macedon,complex
he was the son of the king of macedon philip ii and his fourth wife olympias the daughter of neoptolemus i king of epirus,complex
although philip had seven or eight wives olympias was his principal wife for some time likely because she gave birth to alexander,complex
several legends surround alexander 's birth and childhood,complex
according to the ancient greek biographer plutarch on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to philip olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunder bolt that caused a flame to spread far and wide before dying away,complex
sometime after the wedding philip is said to have seen himself in a dream securing his wife 's womb with a seal engraved with a lion 's image,complex
plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams : that olympias was pregnant before her marriage indicated by the sealing of her womb or that alexander 's father was zeus,complex
ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious olympias promulgated the story of alexander 's divine parentage variously claiming that she had told alexander or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious,complex
on the day alexander was born philip was preparing a siege on the city of potidea on the peninsula of chalcidice,complex
that same day philip received news that his general parmenion had defeated the combined illyrian and paeonian armies and that his horses had won at the olympic games,complex
it was also said that on this day the temple of artemis in ephesus one of the seven wonders of the world burnt down,complex
this led hegesias of magnesia to say that it had burnt down because artemis was away attending the birth of alexander,complex
such legends may have emerged when alexander was king and possibly at his own instigation to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception,complex
in his early years alexander was raised by a nurse lanike sister of alexander 's future general cleitus the black,complex
later in his childhood alexander was tutored by the strict leonidas a relative of his mother and by lysimachus of acarnania,complex
alexander was raised in the manner of noble macedonian youths learning to read play the lyre ride fight and hunt,complex
when alexander was ten years old a trader from thessaly brought philip a horse which he offered to sell for thirteen talents,complex
the horse refused to be mounted and philip ordered it away,complex
alexander however detecting the horse 's fear of its own shadow asked to tame the horse which he eventually managed,complex
plutarch stated that philip overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition kissed his son tearfully declaring : my boy you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions,complex
macedon is too small for you and bought the horse for him,complex
alexander named it bucephalas meaning ox-head,complex
bucephalas carried alexander as far as india,complex
when the animal died because of old age according to plutarch at age thirty alexander named a city after him bucephala,complex
when alexander was philip began to search for a tutor and considered such academics as isocrates and speusippus the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the academy to take up the post,complex
in the end philip chose aristotle and provided the temple of the nymphs at mieza as a classroom,complex
in return for teaching alexander philip agreed to rebuild aristotle 's hometown of stageira which philip had razed and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves or pardoning those who were in exile,complex
mieza was like a boarding school for alexander and the children of macedonian nobles such as ptolemy hephaistion and cassander,complex
many of these students would become his friends and future generals and are often known as the 'companions ',complex
as a consequence of roman customs society and personal preference augustus classical latin : [ awˈɡʊstʊs ] was known by many names throughout his life : gaius octavius thurinus : he received his birth name after his biological father in bc,complex
gaius was his praenomen octavius was his nomen and thurinus was his cognomen,complex
later his rival mark antony used the name thurinus as an insult to which augustus replied surprised that using his old name was thought to be an insult,complex
gaius julius caesar : after he was adopted by julius caesar he adopted caesar 's name in accordance with roman naming conventions,complex
while he dropped all references to the octavius family people colloquially added the epithet octavianus to his legal name either to differentiate him from his adoptive father or to highlight his more modest origins,complex
modern historians refer to him using the anglicized form octavian between bc and bc,complex
gaius julius caesar divi filius : two years after his adoption he founded the temple of caesar additionally adding the title divi filius son of the divine to his name in attempt to strengthen his political ties to caesar 's former soldiers following the deification of caesar,complex
imperator caesar divi filius : from bc octavian opted to use imperator the title by which troops hailed their leader after military success,complex
his name is roughly translated as commander caesar son of the divine,complex
imperator caesar divi filius augustus : following his bc defeat of mark antony and cleopatra partly on his own insistence the roman senate granted him the additional name augustus,complex
which he added to his previous names thereafter,complex
historians use this name to refer to him from bc until his death in ad,complex
while his paternal family was from the town of velletri approximately kilometres mi from rome augustus was born in the city of rome on september bc,complex
he was born at ox head a small property on the palatine hill very close to the roman forum,complex
he was given the name gaius octavius thurinus his cognomen possibly commemorating his father 's victory at thurii over a rebellious band of slaves,complex
suetonius wrote : there are many indications that the octavian family was in days of old a distinguished one at velitrae for not only was a street in the most frequented part of town long ago called octavian but an altar was shown there besides consecrated by an octavius,complex
this man was leader in a war with a neighbouring town,complex
due to the crowded nature of rome at the time octavius was taken to his father 's home village at velletri to be raised,complex
octavius only mentions his father 's equestrian family briefly in his memoirs,complex
his paternal great-grandfather gaius octavius was a military tribune in sicily during the second punic war,complex
his grandfather had served in several local political offices,complex
his father also named gaius octavius had been governor of macedonia,complex
his mother atia was the niece of julius caesar,complex
in bc when he was four years old his father died,complex
his mother married a former governor of syria lucius marcius philippus,complex
philippus claimed descent from alexander the great and was elected consul in bc,complex
philippus never had much of an interest in young octavius,complex
because of this octavius was raised by his grandmother julia the sister of julius caesar,complex
julia died in or bc and octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother,complex
from this point his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him,complex
he donned the toga virilis four years later and was elected to the college of pontiffs in bc,complex
the following year he was put in charge of the greek games that were staged in honor of the temple of venus genetrix built by julius caesar,complex
according to nicolaus of damascus octavius wished to join caesar 's staff for his campaign in africa but gave way when his mother protested,complex
in bc she consented for him to join caesar in hispania where he planned to fight the forces of pompey caesar 's late enemy but octavius fell ill and was unable to travel,complex
the ancestors of napoleon descended from minor italian nobility of tuscan origin who had come to corsica from liguria in the th century,complex
his parents carlo maria di buonaparte and maria letizia ramolino maintained an ancestral home called casa buonaparte in ajaccio,complex
napoleon was born there on august their fourth child and third son,complex
a boy and girl were born first but died in infancy,complex
he had an elder brother joseph and younger siblings lucien elisa louis pauline caroline and jérôme,complex
napoleon was baptised as a catholic,complex
although he was born napoleone di buonaparte italian : [ napoleˈoːne di bwɔnaˈparte ] he changed his name to napoléon bonaparte french : [ napoleɔ̃ bɔnɑpaʁt ] when he was in upon his first marriage,complex
napoleon was born the same year the republic of genoa a former commune of italy transferred corsica to france,complex
the state sold sovereign rights a year before his birth in and the island was conquered by france during the year of his birth and formally incorporated as a province in after years under nominal genoese rule and years of independence,complex
napoleon 's parents fought to maintain independence even when maria was pregnant with him,complex
his father was an attorney who went on to be named corsica 's representative to the court of louis xvi in,complex
the dominant influence of napoleon 's childhood was his mother whose firm discipline restrained a rambunctious child,complex
napoleon 's maternal grandmother had married into the swiss fesch family in her second marriage and napoleon 's uncle the cardinal joseph fesch would fulfill a role as protector of the bonaparte family for some years,complex
napoleon 's noble moderately affluent background afforded him greater opportunities to study than were available to a typical corsican of the time,complex
when he turned years old he moved to the french mainland and enrolled at a religious school in autun in january,complex
in may he transferred with a scholarship to a military academy at brienne-le-château,complex
in his youth he was an outspoken corsican nationalist and supported the state 's independence from france,complex
like many corsicans napoleon spoke and read corsican as his mother tongue and italian as the official language of corsica,complex
he began learning french in school at around age,complex
although he became fluent in french he spoke with a distinctive corsican accent and never learned how to spell french correctly,complex
he was routinely bullied by his peers for his accent birthplace short stature mannerisms and inability to speak french quickly,complex
bonaparte became reserved and melancholy applying himself to reading,complex
an examiner observed that napoleon has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics,complex
he is fairly well acquainted with history and geography,complex
this boy would make an excellent sailor,complex
in early adulthood he briefly intended to become a writer he authored a history of corsica and a romantic novella,complex
on completion of his studies at brienne in napoleon was admitted to the école militaire in paris,complex
he trained to become an artillery officer and when his father 's death reduced his income was forced to complete the two-year course in one year,complex
he was the first corsican to graduate from the école militaire,complex
he was examined by the famed scientist pierre-simon laplace,complex
upon graduating in september bonaparte was commissioned a second lieutenant in la fère artillery regiment,complex
he served in valence and auxonne until after the outbreak of the revolution in and took nearly two years ' leave in corsica and paris during this period,complex
at this time he was a fervent corsican nationalist and wrote to corsican leader pasquale paoli in may as the nation was perishing i was born,complex
thirty thousand frenchmen were vomited on to our shores drowning the throne of liberty in waves of blood,complex
such was the odious sight which was the first to strike me,complex
he spent the early years of the revolution in corsica fighting in a complex three-way struggle among royalists revolutionaries and corsican nationalists,complex
he was a supporter of the republican jacobin movement organising clubs in corsica and was given command over a battalion of volunteers,complex
he was promoted to captain in the regular army in july despite exceeding his leave of absence and leading a riot against french troops,complex
he came into conflict with paoli who had decided to split with france and sabotage the corsican contribution to the expédition de sardaigne by preventing a french assault on the sardinian island of la maddalena,complex
bonaparte and his family fled to the french mainland in june because of the split with paoli,complex
in july bonaparte published a pro-republican pamphlet entitled le souper de beaucaire supper at beaucaire which gained him the support of augustin robespierre younger brother of the revolutionary leader maximilien robespierre,complex
with the help of his fellow corsican antoine christophe saliceti bonaparte was appointed artillery commander of the republican forces at the siege of toulon,complex
he adopted a plan to capture a hill where republican guns could dominate the city 's harbour and force the british to evacuate,complex
the assault on the position led to the capture of the city but during it bonaparte was wounded in the thigh,complex
he was promoted to brigadier general at the age of,complex
catching the attention of the committee of public safety he was put in charge of the artillery of france 's army of italy,complex
napoleon spent time as inspector of coastal fortifications on the mediterranean coast near marseille while he was waiting for confirmation of the army of italy post,complex
he devised plans for attacking the kingdom of sardinia as part of france 's campaign against the first coalition,complex
augustin robespierre and saliceti were ready to listen to the freshly promoted artillery general,complex
the french army carried out bonaparte 's plan in the battle of saorgio in april and then advanced to seize ormea in the mountains,complex
from ormea they headed west to outflank the austro-sardinian positions around saorge,complex
after this campaign augustin robespierre sent bonaparte on a mission to the republic of genoa to determine that country 's intentions towards france,complex
some contemporaries alleged that bonaparte was put under house arrest at nice for his association with the robespierres following their fall in the thermidorian reaction in july but napoleon 's secretary bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs,complex
according to bourrienne jealousy was responsible between the army of the alps and the army of italy with whom napoleon was seconded at the time,complex
bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense in a letter to the commissar saliceti and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing,complex
he was released within two weeks and due to his technical skills was asked to draw up plans to attack italian positions in the context of france 's war with austria,complex
he also took part in an expedition to take back corsica from the british but the french were repulsed by the british royal navy,complex
by bonaparte had become engaged to désirée clary daughter of françois clary,complex
désirée 's sister julie clary had married bonaparte 's elder brother joseph,complex
in april he was assigned to the army of the west which was engaged in the war in the vendée—a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in vendée a region in west central france on the atlantic ocean,complex
as an infantry command it was a demotion from artillery general—for which the army already had a full quota—and he pleaded poor health to avoid the posting,complex
he was moved to the bureau of topography of the committee of public safety and sought unsuccessfully to be transferred to constantinople in order to offer his services to the sultan,complex
during this period he wrote the romantic novella clisson et eugénie about a soldier and his lover in a clear parallel to bonaparte 's own relationship with désirée,complex
on september bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for his refusal to serve in the vendée campaign,complex
he faced a difficult financial situation and reduced career prospects,complex
on october royalists in paris declared a rebellion against the national convention,complex
paul barras a leader of the thermidorian reaction knew of bonaparte 's military exploits at toulon and gave him command of the improvised forces in defence of the convention in the tuileries palace,complex
napoleon had seen the massacre of the king 's swiss guard there three years earlier and realised that artillery would be the key to its defence,complex
he ordered a young cavalry officer named joachim murat to seize large cannons and used them to repel the attackers on october — vendémiaire an iv in the french republican calendar royalists died and the rest fled,complex
he had cleared the streets with a whiff of grapeshot according to th-century historian thomas carlyle in the french revolution : a history,complex
the defeat of the royalist insurrection extinguished the threat to the convention and earned bonaparte sudden fame wealth and the patronage of the new government the directory,complex
murat married one of napoleon 's sisters becoming his brother-in-law he also served under napoleon as one of his generals,complex
bonaparte was promoted to commander of the interior and given command of the army of italy,complex
within weeks he was romantically involved with joséphine de beauharnais the former mistress of barras,complex
the couple married on march in a civil ceremony,complex
two days after the marriage bonaparte left paris to take command of the army of italy,complex
he immediately went on the offensive hoping to defeat the forces of piedmont before their austrian allies could intervene,complex
in a series of rapid victories during the montenotte campaign he knocked piedmont out of the war in two weeks,complex
the french then focused on the austrians for the remainder of the war the highlight of which became the protracted struggle for mantua,complex
the austrians launched a series of offensives against the french to break the siege but napoleon defeated every relief effort scoring victories at the battles of castiglione bassano arcole and rivoli,complex
the decisive french triumph at rivoli in january led to the collapse of the austrian position in italy,complex
at rivoli the austrians lost up to men while the french lost about,complex
the next phase of the campaign featured the french invasion of the habsburg heartlands,complex
french forces in southern germany had been defeated by the archduke charles in but the archduke withdrew his forces to protect vienna after learning about napoleon 's assault,complex
in the first encounter between the two commanders napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into austrian territory after winning at the battle of tarvis in march,complex
the austrians were alarmed by the french thrust that reached all the way to leoben about km from vienna and finally decided to sue for peace,complex
the treaty of leoben followed by the more comprehensive treaty of campo formio gave france control of most of northern italy and the low countries and a secret clause promised the republic of venice to austria,complex
bonaparte marched on venice and forced its surrender ending years of independence,complex
he also authorized the french to loot treasures such as the horses of saint mark,complex
his application of conventional military ideas to real-world situations enabled his military triumphs such as creative use of artillery as a mobile force to support his infantry,complex
he stated later in life : i have fought sixty battles and i have learned nothing which i did not know at the beginning,complex
look at caesar he fought the first like the last,complex
bonaparte could win battles by concealment of troop deployments and concentration of his forces on the hinge of an enemy 's weakened front,complex
if he could not use his favourite envelopment strategy he would take up the central position and attack two co-operating forces at their hinge swing round to fight one until it fled then turn to face the other,complex
in this italian campaign bonaparte 's army captured prisoners cannons and standards,complex
the french army fought actions and won pitched battles through superior artillery technology and bonaparte 's tactics,complex
during the campaign bonaparte became increasingly influential in french politics,complex
he founded two newspapers : one for the troops in his army and another for circulation in france,complex
the royalists attacked bonaparte for looting italy and warned that he might become a dictator,complex
all told napoleon 's forces extracted an estimated million in funds from italy during their campaign there another million in precious metals and jewels atop that his forces confiscated more than three-hundred priceless paintings and sculptures,complex
bonaparte sent general pierre augereau to paris to lead a coup d'état and purge the royalists on september—coup of fructidor,complex
this left barras and his republican allies in control again but dependent on bonaparte who proceeded to peace negotiations with austria,complex
these negotiations resulted in the treaty of campo formio and bonaparte returned to paris in december as a hero,complex
he met talleyrand france 's new foreign minister—who served in the same capacity for emperor napoleon—and they began to prepare for an invasion of britain,complex
after two months of planning bonaparte decided that france 's naval power was not yet strong enough to confront the british royal navy,complex
he decided on a military expedition to seize egypt and thereby undermine britain 's access to its trade interests in india,complex
bonaparte wished to establish a french presence in the middle east linking with tipu sultan a muslim enemy of the british in india,complex
napoleon assured the directory that as soon as he had conquered egypt he will establish relations with the indian princes and together with them attack the english in their possessions,complex
the directory agreed in order to secure a trade route to india,complex
in may bonaparte was elected a member of the french academy of sciences,complex
his egyptian expedition included a group of scientists with mathematicians naturalists chemists and geodesists among them,complex
their discoveries included the rosetta stone and their work was published in the description de l'égypte in,complex
en route to egypt bonaparte reached malta on june then controlled by the knights hospitaller,complex
grand master ferdinand von hompesch zu bolheim surrendered after token resistance and bonaparte captured an important naval base with the loss of only three men,complex
general bonaparte and his expedition eluded pursuit by the royal navy and landed at alexandria on july,complex
he fought the battle of shubra khit against the mamluks egypt 's ruling military caste,complex
this helped the french practise their defensive tactic for the battle of the pyramids fought on july about km mi from the pyramids,complex
general bonaparte 's forces of roughly equalled those of the mamluks ' egyptian cavalry,complex
twenty-nine french and approximately egyptians were killed,complex
the victory boosted the morale of the french army,complex
on august the british fleet under sir horatio nelson captured or destroyed all but two french vessels in the battle of the nile defeating bonaparte 's goal to strengthen the french position in the mediterranean,complex
his army had succeeded in a temporary increase of french power in egypt though it faced repeated uprisings,complex
in early he moved an army into the ottoman province of damascus syria and galilee,complex
bonaparte led these french soldiers in the conquest of the coastal towns of arish gaza jaffa and haifa,complex
the attack on jaffa was particularly brutal,complex
bonaparte discovered that many of the defenders were former prisoners of war ostensibly on parole so he ordered the garrison and prisoners to be executed by bayonet or drowning to save bullets,complex
men women and children were robbed and murdered for three days,complex
bonaparte began with an army of men were reported missing died in combat and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague,complex
he failed to reduce the fortress of acre so he marched his army back to egypt in may,complex
to speed up the retreat bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium the number who died remains disputed ranging from a low of to a high of,complex
he also brought out wounded men,complex
back in egypt on july bonaparte defeated an ottoman amphibious invasion at abukir,complex
while in egypt bonaparte stayed informed of european affairs,complex
he learned that france had suffered a series of defeats in the war of the second coalition,complex
on august he took advantage of the temporary departure of british ships from french coastal ports and set sail for france despite the fact that he had received no explicit orders from paris,complex
the army was left in the charge of jean baptiste kléber,complex
unknown to bonaparte the directory had sent him orders to return to ward off possible invasions of french soil but poor lines of communication prevented the delivery of these messages,complex
by the time that he reached paris in october france 's situation had been improved by a series of victories,complex
the republic however was bankrupt and the ineffective directory was unpopular with the french population,complex
the directory discussed bonaparte 's desertion but was too weak to punish him,complex
despite the failures in egypt napoleon returned to a hero 's welcome,complex
he drew together an alliance with director emmanuel joseph sieyès his brother lucien speaker of the council of five hundred roger ducos director joseph fouché and talleyrand and they overthrew the directory by a coup d'état on november the th brumaire according to the revolutionary calendar closing down the council of five hundred,complex
napoleon became first consul for ten years with two consuls appointed by him who had consultative voices only,complex
his power was confirmed by the new constitution of the year viii originally devised by sieyès to give napoleon a minor role but rewritten by napoleon and accepted by direct popular vote in favor opposed,complex
the constitution preserved the appearance of a republic but in reality established a dictatorship,complex
napoleon established a political system that historian martyn lyons called dictatorship by plebiscite,complex
worried by the democratic forces unleashed by the revolution but unwilling to ignore them entirely napoleon resorted to regular electoral consultations with the french people on his road to imperial power,complex
scholars are hesitant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the buddha 's life,complex
most people accept that the buddha lived taught and founded a monastic order during the mahajanapada era during the reign of bimbisara c,complex
– c,complex
bce or c,complex
bce the ruler of the magadha empire and died during the early years of the reign of ajatasatru who was the successor of bimbisara thus making him a younger contemporary of mahavira the jain tirthankara,complex
while the general sequence of birth maturity renunciation search awakening and liberation teaching death is widely accepted there is less consensus on the veracity of many details contained in traditional biographies,complex
the times of gautama 's birth and death are uncertain,complex
most historians in the early th century dated his lifetime as c,complex
bce to bce,complex
more recently his death is dated later between and bce while at a symposium on this question held in the majority of those who presented definite opinions gave dates within years either side of bce for the buddha 's death,complex
these alternative chronologies however have not been accepted by all historians,complex
the evidence of the early texts suggests that siddhārtha gautama was born into the shakya clan a community that was on the periphery both geographically and culturally of the eastern indian subcontinent in the th century bce,complex
one of his usual names was sakamuni or sakyamunī sage of the shakyas,complex
it was either a small republic or an oligarchy and his father was an elected chieftain or oligarch,complex
according to the buddhist tradition gautama was born in lumbini now in modern-day nepal and raised in the shakya capital of kapilvastu which may have been either in what is present day tilaurakot nepal or piprahwa india,complex
he obtained his enlightenment in bodh gaya gave his first sermon in sarnath and died in kushinagar,complex
apart from the vedic brahmins the buddha 's lifetime coincided with the flourishing of influential śramaṇa schools of thought like ājīvika cārvāka jainism and ajñana,complex
brahmajala sutta records sixty-two such schools of thought,complex
in this context a śramaṇa refers to one who labors toils or exerts themselves for some higher or religious purpose,complex
it was also the age of influential thinkers like mahavira pūraṇa kassapa makkhali gosāla ajita kesakambalī pakudha kaccāyana and sañjaya belaṭṭhaputta as recorded in samaññaphala sutta whose viewpoints the buddha most certainly must have been acquainted with,complex
indeed sariputta and moggallāna two of the foremost disciples of the buddha were formerly the foremost disciples of sañjaya belaṭṭhaputta the sceptic and the pali canon frequently depicts buddha engaging in debate with the adherents of rival schools of thought,complex
there is also philological evidence to suggest that the two masters alara kalama and uddaka ramaputta were indeed historical figures and they most probably taught buddha two different forms of meditative techniques,complex
thus buddha was just one of the many śramaṇa philosophers of that time,complex
in an era where holiness of person was judged by their level of asceticism buddha was a reformist within the śramaṇa movement rather than a reactionary against vedic brahminism,complex
historically the life of the buddha also coincided with the achaemenid conquest of the indus valley during the rule of darius i from about / bce,complex
this achaemenid occupation of the areas of gandhara and sindh which was to last for about two centuries was accompanied by the introduction of achaemenid religions reformed mazdaism or early zoroastrianism to which buddhism might have in part reacted,complex
in particular the ideas of the buddha may have partly consisted in a rejection of the absolutist or perfectionist ideas contained in these achaemenid religions,complex
no written records about gautama were found from his lifetime or from the one or two centuries thereafter,complex
in the middle of the rd century bce several edicts of ashoka reigned c,complex
– bce mention the buddha and particularly ashoka 's rummindei minor pillar edict commemorates the emperor 's pilgrimage to lumbini as the buddha 's birthplace,complex
another one of his edicts minor rock edict no,complex
mentions the titles of several dhamma texts establishing the existence of a written buddhist tradition at least by the time of the maurya era,complex
these texts may be the precursor of the pāli canon,complex
sakamuni in also mentionned in the reliefs of bharhut dated to circa bce in relation with his illumination and the bodhi tree with the inscription bhagavato sakamunino bodho the illumination of the blessed sakamuni,complex
the oldest surviving buddhist manuscripts are the gandhāran buddhist texts reported to have been found in or around haḍḍa near jalalabad in eastern afghanistan and now preserved in the british library,complex
they are written in the gāndhārī language using the kharosthi script on twenty-seven birch bark manuscripts and date from the first century bce to the third century ce,complex
on the basis of philological evidence indologist and pali expert oskar von hinüber says that some of the pali suttas have retained very archaic place-names syntax and historical data from close to the buddha 's lifetime including the mahāparinibbāṇa sutta which contains a detailed account of the buddha 's final days,complex
hinüber proposes a composition date of no later than – bce for this text which would allow for a true historical memory of the events approximately years prior if the short chronology for the buddha 's lifetime is accepted but also reminds that such a text was originally intended more as hagiography than as an exact historical record of events,complex
,complex
the sources for the life of siddhārtha gautama are a variety of different and sometimes conflicting traditional biographies,complex
these include the buddhacarita lalitavistara sūtra mahāvastu and the nidānakathā,complex
of these the buddhacarita is the earliest full biography an epic poem written by the poet aśvaghoṣa in the first century ce,complex
the lalitavistara sūtra is the next oldest biography a mahāyāna/sarvāstivāda biography dating to the rd century ce,complex
the mahāvastu from the mahāsāṃghika lokottaravāda tradition is another major biography composed incrementally until perhaps the th century ce,complex
the dharmaguptaka biography of the buddha is the most exhaustive and is entitled the abhiniṣkramaṇa sūtra and various chinese translations of this date between the rd and th century ce,complex
the nidānakathā is from the theravada tradition in sri lanka and was composed in the th century by buddhaghoṣa,complex
from canonical sources come the jataka tales the mahapadana sutta dn and the achariyabhuta sutta mn which include selective accounts that may be older but are not full biographies,complex
the jātakas retell previous lives of gautama as a bodhisattva and the first collection of these can be dated among the earliest buddhist texts,complex
the mahāpadāna sutta and achariyabhuta sutta both recount miraculous events surrounding gautama 's birth such as the bodhisattva 's descent from the tuṣita heaven into his mother 's womb,complex
in the earliest buddhist texts the nikāyas and āgamas the buddha is not depicted as possessing omniscience sabbaññu nor is he depicted as being an eternal transcendent lokottara being,complex
according to bhikkhu analayo ideas of the buddha 's omniscience along with an increasing tendency to deify him and his biography are found only later in the mahayana sutras and later pali commentaries or texts such as the mahāvastu,complex
in the sandaka sutta the buddha 's disciple ananda outlines an argument against the claims of teachers who say they are all knowing while in the tevijjavacchagotta sutta the buddha himself states that he has never made a claim to being omniscient instead he claimed to have the higher knowledges abhijñā,complex
the earliest biographical material from the pali nikayas focuses on the buddha 's life as a śramaṇa his search for enlightenment under various teachers such as alara kalama and his forty-five-year career as a teacher,complex
traditional biographies of gautama generally include numerous miracles omens and supernatural events,complex
the character of the buddha in these traditional biographies is often that of a fully transcendent skt,complex
lokottara and perfected being who is unencumbered by the mundane world,complex
in the mahāvastu over the course of many lives gautama is said to have developed supramundane abilities including : a painless birth conceived without intercourse no need for sleep food medicine or bathing although engaging in such in conformity with the world omniscience and the ability to suppress karma,complex
nevertheless some of the more ordinary details of his life have been gathered from these traditional sources,complex
in modern times there has been an attempt to form a secular understanding of siddhārtha gautama 's life by omitting the traditional supernatural elements of his early biographies,complex
andrew skilton writes that the buddha was never historically regarded by buddhist traditions as being merely human : it is important to stress that despite modern theravada teachings to the contrary often a sop to skeptical western pupils he was never seen as being merely human,complex
for instance he is often described as having the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks or signs of a mahāpuruṣa superman the buddha himself denied that he was either a man or a god and in the mahāparinibbāna sutta he states that he could live for an aeon were he asked to do so,complex
the ancient indians were generally unconcerned with chronologies being more focused on philosophy,complex
buddhist texts reflect this tendency providing a clearer picture of what gautama may have taught than of the dates of the events in his life,complex
these texts contain descriptions of the culture and daily life of ancient india which can be corroborated from the jain scriptures and make the buddha 's time the earliest period in indian history for which significant accounts exist,complex
british author karen armstrong writes that although there is very little information that can be considered historically sound we can be reasonably confident that siddhārtha gautama did exist as a historical figure,complex
michael carrithers goes a bit further by stating that the most general outline of birth maturity renunciation search awakening and liberation teaching death must be true,complex
,complex
the buddhist tradition regards lumbini in present-day nepal to be the birthplace of the buddha,complex
he grew up in kapilavastu,complex
the exact site of ancient kapilavastu is unknown,complex
it may have been either piprahwa uttar pradesh in present-day india or tilaurakot in present-day nepal,complex
both places belonged to the sakya territory and are located only miles apart,complex
gautama was born as a kshatriya the son of śuddhodana an elected chief of the shakya clan whose capital was kapilavastu and who were later annexed by the growing kingdom of kosala during the buddha 's lifetime,complex
gautama was the family name,complex
his mother maya māyādevī suddhodana 's wife was a koliyan princess,complex
legend has it that on the night siddhartha was conceived queen maya dreamt that a white elephant with six white tusks entered her right side and ten months later siddhartha was born,complex
as was the shakya tradition when his mother queen maya became pregnant she left kapilavastu for her father 's kingdom to give birth,complex
however her son is said to have been born on the way at lumbini in a garden beneath a sal tree,complex
the day of the buddha 's birth is widely celebrated in theravada countries as vesak,complex
buddha 's birthday is called buddha purnima in nepal bangladesh and india as he is believed to have been born on a full moon day,complex
various sources hold that the buddha 's mother died at his birth a few days or seven days later,complex
the infant was given the name siddhartha pāli : siddhattha meaning he who achieves his aim,complex
a typical jew in jesus ' time had only one name sometimes supplemented with the father 's name or the individual 's hometown,complex
thus in the new testament jesus is commonly referred to as jesus of nazareth e,complex
g,complex
mark :,complex
jesus ' neighbors in nazareth refer to him as the carpenter the son of mary and brother of james and joses and judas and simon mark : the carpenter 's son matthew : or joseph 's son luke :,complex
in john the disciple philip refers to him as jesus son of joseph from nazareth john :,complex
the name jesus is derived from the latin iesus a transliteration of the greek ἰησοῦς iesous,complex
the greek form is a rendering of the hebrew ישוע‎ yeshua a variant of the earlier name יהושע‎ yehoshua or in english joshua,complex
the name yeshua appears to have been in use in judea at the time of the birth of jesus,complex
the st-century works of historian flavius josephus who wrote in koine greek the same language as that of the new testament refer to at least twenty different people with the name jesus i,complex
e,complex
ἰησοῦς,complex
the etymology of jesus ' name in the context of the new testament is generally given as yahweh is salvation,complex
since early christianity christians have commonly referred to jesus as jesus christ,complex
the word christ was a title or office the christ not a given name,complex
it derives from the greek χριστός christos a translation of the hebrew mashiakh משיח meaning anointed and is usually transliterated into english as messiah,complex
in biblical judaism sacred oil was used to anoint certain exceptionally holy people and objects as part of their religious investiture see leviticus : – and exodus :,complex
christians of the time designated jesus as the christ because they believed him to be the messiah whose arrival is prophesied in the hebrew bible and old testament,complex
in postbiblical usage christ became viewed as a name—one part of jesus christ,complex
the term christian meaning a follower of christ has been in use since the st century,complex
,complex
the four canonical gospels matthew mark luke and john are the foremost sources for the life and message of jesus,complex
however other parts of the new testament also include references to key episodes in his life such as the last supper in corinthians :,complex
acts of the apostles acts : – and acts refers to the early ministry of jesus and its anticipation by john the baptist,complex
acts : – says more about the ascension of jesus also mentioned in timothy : than the canonical gospels do,complex
in the undisputed pauline letters which were written earlier than the gospels the words or instructions of jesus are cited several times corinthians : – : : – corinthians :,complex
some early christian groups had separate descriptions of the life and teachings of jesus that are not included in the new testament,complex
these include the gospel of thomas gospel of peter and gospel of judas the apocryphon of james and many other apocryphal writings,complex
most scholars conclude that these are written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical gospels,complex
the canonical gospels are four accounts each written by a different author,complex
the authors of the gospels are all anonymous attributed by tradition to the four evangelists each with close ties to jesus : mark by john mark an associate of peter matthew by one of jesus ' disciples luke by a companion of paul mentioned in a few epistles and john by another of jesus ' disciples the beloved disciple,complex
one important aspect of the study of the gospels is the literary genre under which they fall,complex
genre is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of writings,complex
whether the gospel authors set out to write novels myths histories or biographies has a tremendous impact on how they ought to be interpreted,complex
some recent studies suggest that the genre of the gospels ought to be situated within the realm of ancient biography,complex
although not without critics the position that the gospels are a type of ancient biography is the consensus among scholars today,complex
not everything contained in the new testament gospels is considered to be historically reliable,complex
views range from their being inerrant descriptions of the life of jesus to their providing little historical information about his life beyond the basics,complex
according to a broad scholarly consensus the synoptic gospels matthew mark and luke and not john are the most reliable sources of information about jesus,complex
according to the marcan priority the first to be written was the gospel of mark written ad – followed by the gospel of matthew ad – the gospel of luke ad – and the gospel of john ad –,complex
furthermore most scholars agree that the authors of matthew and luke used mark as a source when writing their gospels,complex
matthew and luke also share some content not found in mark,complex
to explain this many scholars believe that in addition to mark another source commonly called the q source was used by the two authors,complex
matthew mark and luke are known as the synoptic gospels from the greek σύν syn together and ὄψις opsis view,complex
they are similar in content narrative arrangement language and paragraph structure,complex
scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the synoptic gospels and the gospel of john,complex
while the flow of some events such as jesus ' baptism transfiguration crucifixion and interactions with the apostles are shared among the synoptic gospels incidents such as the transfiguration do not appear in john which also differs on other matters such as the cleansing of the temple,complex
the synoptics emphasize different aspects of jesus,complex
in mark jesus is the son of god whose mighty works demonstrate the presence of god 's kingdom,complex
he is a tireless wonder worker the servant of both god and man,complex
this short gospel records few of jesus ' words or teachings,complex
the gospel of matthew emphasizes that jesus is the fulfillment of god 's will as revealed in the old testament and he is the lord of the church,complex
he is the son of david a king and the messiah,complex
luke presents jesus as the divine-human savior who shows compassion to the needy,complex
he is the friend of sinners and outcasts come to seek and save the lost,complex
this gospel includes jesus ' most beloved parables such as the good samaritan and the prodigal son,complex
the prologue to the gospel of john identifies jesus as an incarnation of the divine word logos,complex
as the word jesus was eternally present with god active in all creation and the source of humanity 's moral and spiritual nature,complex
jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be,complex
he not only speaks god 's word he is god 's word,complex
in the gospel of john jesus reveals his divine role publicly,complex
here he is the bread of life the light of the world the true vine and more,complex
in general the authors of the new testament showed little interest in an absolute chronology of jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age,complex
as stated in john : the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of jesus,complex
the accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early christianity with timelines as a secondary consideration,complex
in this respect it is noteworthy that the gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of the life of jesus in jerusalem referred to as the passion,complex
although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of jesus,complex
jesus was jewish born by mary wife of joseph matthew luke,complex
the gospels of matthew and luke offer two accounts of the genealogy of jesus,complex
matthew traces jesus ' ancestry to abraham through david,complex
luke traces jesus ' ancestry through adam to god,complex
the lists are identical between abraham and david but differ radically from that point,complex
matthew has twenty-seven generations from david to joseph whereas luke has forty-two with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists,complex
various theories have been put forward seeking to explain why the two genealogies are so different,complex
matthew and luke each describe jesus ' nativity or birth especially that jesus was born by a virgin mary in bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy,complex
luke 's account emphasizes events before the birth of jesus and centers on mary while matthew 's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on joseph,complex
both accounts state that jesus was born to joseph and mary his betrothed in bethlehem and both support the doctrine of the virgin birth of jesus according to which jesus was miraculously conceived by the holy spirit in mary 's womb when she was still a virgin,complex
at the same time there is evidence at least in the lukan acts of the apostles that jesus was thought to have had like many figures in antiquity a dual paternity since there it is stated he descended from the seed or loins of david,complex
in matthew joseph is troubled because mary his betrothed is pregnant matthew : – but in the first of joseph 's three dreams an angel assures him not to be afraid to take mary as his wife because her child was conceived by the holy spirit,complex
in matthew : – wise men or magi from the east bring gifts to the young jesus as the king of the jews,complex
herod the great hears of jesus ' birth and wanting him killed orders the murders of male infants in bethlehem,complex
but an angel warns joseph in his second dream and the family flees to egypt—later to return and settle in nazareth,complex
in luke : – mary learns from the angel gabriel that she will conceive and bear a child called jesus through the action of the holy spirit,complex
when mary is due to give birth she and joseph travel from nazareth to joseph 's ancestral home in bethlehem to register in the census ordered by caesar augustus,complex
while there mary gives birth to jesus and as they have found no room in the inn she places the newborn in a manger luke : –,complex
an angel announces the birth to some shepherds who go to bethlehem to see jesus and subsequently spread the news abroad luke : –,complex
after the presentation of jesus at the temple joseph mary and jesus return to nazareth,complex
jesus ' childhood home is identified in the gospels of luke and matthew as the town of nazareth in galilee where he lived with his family,complex
although joseph appears in descriptions of jesus ' childhood no mention is made of him thereafter,complex
his other family members—his mother mary his brothers james joses or joseph judas and simon and his unnamed sisters—are mentioned in the gospels and other sources,complex
the gospel of mark reports that jesus comes into conflict with his neighbors and family,complex
jesus ' mother and brothers come to get him mark : – because people are saying that he is crazy mark :,complex
jesus responds that his followers are his true family,complex
in john mary follows jesus to his crucifixion and he expresses concern over her well-being john : –,complex
jesus is called a τέκτων tektōn in mark : traditionally understood as carpenter but could cover makers of objects in various materials including builders,complex
the gospels indicate that jesus could read paraphrase and debate scripture but this does not necessarily mean that he received formal scribal training,complex
when jesus is presented as a baby in the temple per jewish law a man named simeon says to mary and joseph that jesus shall stand as a sign of contradiction while a sword will pierce your own soul,complex
then the secret thoughts of many will come to light luke : –,complex
several years later when jesus goes missing on a visit to jerusalem his parents find him in the temple sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking questions and the people are amazed at his understanding and answers mary scolds jesus for going missing to which jesus replies that he must be in his father 's house luke : –,complex
the synoptic accounts of jesus ' baptism are all preceded by information about john the baptist,complex
they show john preaching penance and repentance for the remission of sins and encouraging the giving of alms to the poor luke : as he baptizes people in the area of the jordan river around perea and foretells luke : the arrival of someone more powerful than he,complex
later jesus identifies john as the elijah who was to come matthew : mark : – the prophet who was expected to arrive before the great and terrible day of the lord malachi :,complex
likewise luke says that john had the spirit and power of elijah luke :,complex
in mark john baptizes jesus and as he comes out of the water he sees the holy spirit descending to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be god 's son mark : –,complex
this is one of two events described in the gospels where a voice from heaven calls jesus son the other being the transfiguration,complex
the spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by satan mark : –,complex
jesus then begins his ministry after john 's arrest mark :,complex
jesus ' baptism in matthew is similar,complex

john publicly proclaims jesus as the sacrificial lamb of god and some of john 's followers become disciples of jesus,complex
in this gospel john denies that he is elijah john :,complex
before john is imprisoned jesus leads his followers to baptize disciples as well john : – and they baptize more people than john john :,complex
the synoptics depict two distinct geographical settings in jesus ' ministry,complex
the first takes place north of judea in galilee where jesus conducts a successful ministry and the second shows jesus rejected and killed when he travels to jerusalem,complex
often referred to as rabbi jesus preaches his message orally,complex
notably jesus forbids those who recognize him as the messiah to speak of it including people he heals and demons he exorcises see messianic secret,complex
john depicts jesus ' ministry as largely taking place in and around jerusalem rather than in galilee and jesus ' divine identity is openly proclaimed and immediately recognized,complex
scholars divide the ministry of jesus into several stages,complex
the galilean ministry begins when jesus returns to galilee from the judaean desert after rebuffing the temptation of satan,complex
jesus preaches around galilee and in matthew : – his first disciples who will eventually form the core of the early church encounter him and begin to travel with him,complex
this period includes the sermon on the mount one of jesus ' major discourses as well as the calming of the storm the feeding of the walking on water and a number of other miracles and parables,complex
it ends with the confession of peter and the transfiguration,complex
as jesus travels towards jerusalem in the perean ministry he returns to the area where he was baptized about a third of the way down from the sea of galilee along the jordan river john : –,complex
the final ministry in jerusalem begins with jesus ' triumphal entry into the city on palm sunday,complex
in the synoptic gospels during that week jesus drives the money changers from the second temple and judas bargains to betray him,complex
this period culminates in the last supper and the farewell discourse,complex
near the beginning of his ministry jesus appoints twelve apostles,complex
in matthew and mark despite jesus only briefly requesting that they join him jesus ' first four apostles who were fishermen are described as immediately consenting and abandoning their nets and boats to do so matthew : – mark : –,complex
in john jesus ' first two apostles were disciples of john the baptist,complex
the baptist sees jesus and calls him the lamb of god the two hear this and follow jesus,complex
in addition to the twelve apostles the opening of the passage of the sermon on the plain identifies a much larger group of people as disciples luke :,complex
also in luke : – jesus sends seventy or seventy-two of his followers in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit,complex
they are instructed to accept hospitality heal the sick and spread the word that the kingdom of god is coming,complex
in mark the disciples are notably obtuse,complex
they fail to understand jesus ' miracles mark : – mark : his parables mark : or what rising from the dead would mean mark : –,complex
when jesus is later arrested they desert him,complex
in the synoptics jesus teaches extensively often in parables about the kingdom of god or in matthew the kingdom of heaven,complex
the kingdom is described as both imminent mark : and already present in the ministry of jesus luke :,complex
jesus promises inclusion in the kingdom for those who accept his message mark : –,complex
jesus talks of the son of man an apocalyptic figure who would come to gather the chosen,complex
jesus calls people to repent their sins and to devote themselves completely to god,complex
jesus tells his followers to adhere to jewish law although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself for example regarding the sabbath,complex
when asked what the greatest commandment is jesus replies : you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind,complex
and a second is like it : 'you shall love your neighbor as yourself matthew : –,complex
other ethical teachings of jesus include loving your enemies refraining from hatred and lust turning the other cheek and forgiving people who have sinned against you matthew –,complex
john 's gospel presents the teachings of jesus not merely as his own preaching but as divine revelation,complex
john the baptist for example states in john : : he whom god has sent speaks the words of god for he gives the spirit without measure,complex
in john : jesus says my teaching is not mine but his who sent me,complex
he asserts the same thing in john : : do you not believe that i am in the father and the father is in me ? the words that i say to you i do not speak on my own but the father who dwells in me does his works,complex
approximately thirty parables form about one third of jesus ' recorded teachings,complex
the parables appear within longer sermons and at other places in the narrative,complex
they often contain symbolism and usually relate the physical world to the spiritual,complex
common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of god and the perils of transgression,complex
some of his parables such as the prodigal son luke : – are relatively simple while others such as the growing seed mark : – are sophisticated profound and abstruse,complex
when asked by his disciples about why he speaks in parables to the people jesus replies that the chosen disciples have been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven unlike the rest of their people for the one who has will be given more and he will have in abundance,complex
but the one who does not have will be deprived even more,complex
going on to say that the majority of their generation have grown dull hearts and thus are unable to understand matthew : –,complex
in the gospel accounts jesus devotes a large portion of his ministry performing miracles especially healings,complex
the miracles can be classified into two main categories : healing miracles and nature miracles,complex
the healing miracles include cures for physical ailments exorcisms and resurrections of the dead,complex
the nature miracles show jesus ' power over nature and include turning water into wine walking on water and calming a storm among others,complex
jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source,complex
when jesus ' opponents suddenly accuse him of performing exorcisms by the power of beelzebul the prince of demons jesus counters that he performs them by the spirit of god matthew : or finger of god arguing that all logic suggests that satan would not let his demons assist the children of god because it would divide satan 's house and bring his kingdom to desolation furthermore he asks his opponents that if he exorcises by beel'zebub by whom do your sons cast them out ? luke :,complex
in matthew : – he goes on to say that while all manner of sin even insults against god or insults against the son of man shall be forgiven whoever insults goodness or the holy spirit shall never be forgiven he/she carries the guilt of his/her sin forever,complex
in john jesus ' miracles are described as signs performed to prove his mission and divinity,complex
however in the synoptics when asked by some teachers of the law and some pharisees to give miraculous signs to prove his authority jesus refuses saying that no sign shall come to corrupt and evil people except the sign of the prophet jonah,complex
also in the synoptic gospels the crowds regularly respond to jesus ' miracles with awe and press on him to heal their sick,complex
in john 's gospel jesus is presented as unpressured by the crowds who often respond to his miracles with trust and faith,complex
one characteristic shared among all miracles of jesus in the gospel accounts is that he performed them freely and never requested or accepted any form of payment,complex
the gospel episodes that include descriptions of the miracles of jesus also often include teachings and the miracles themselves involve an element of teaching,complex
many of the miracles teach the importance of faith,complex
in the cleansing of ten lepers and the raising of jairus ' daughter for instance the beneficiaries are told that their healing was due to their faith,complex
at about the middle of each of the three synoptic gospels are two significant events : the confession of peter and the transfiguration of jesus,complex
these two events are not mentioned in the gospel of john,complex
in his confession peter tells jesus you are the messiah the son of the living god,complex
jesus affirms that peter 's confession is divinely revealed truth,complex
after the confession jesus tells his disciples about his upcoming death and resurrection matthew : mark : luke : in the transfiguration matthew : – mark : – and luke : – jesus takes peter and two other apostles up an unnamed mountain where he was transfigured before them and his face shone like the sun and his clothes became dazzling white,complex
a bright cloud appears around them and a voice from the cloud says this is my son the beloved with him i am well pleased listen to him matthew : –,complex
the description of the last week of the life of jesus often called passion week occupies about one third of the narrative in the canonical gospels starting with jesus ' triumphal entry into jerusalem and ending with his crucifixion,complex
in the synoptics the last week in jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey through perea and judea that jesus began in galilee,complex
jesus rides a young donkey into jerusalem reflecting the tale of the messiah 's donkey an oracle from the book of zechariah in which the jews ' humble king enters jerusalem this way zechariah :,complex
people along the way lay cloaks and small branches of trees known as palm fronds in front of him and sing part of psalms : –,complex
jesus next expels the money changers from the second temple accusing them of turning it into a den of thieves through their commercial activities,complex
jesus then prophesies about the coming destruction including false prophets wars earthquakes celestial disorders persecution of the faithful the appearance of an abomination of desolation and unendurable tribulations mark : –,complex
the mysterious son of man he says will dispatch angels to gather the faithful from all parts of the earth mark : –,complex
jesus warns that these wonders will occur in the lifetimes of the hearers mark : –,complex
in john the cleansing of the temple occurs at the beginning of jesus ' ministry instead of at the end john : –,complex
jesus comes into conflict with the jewish elders such as when they question his authority and when he criticizes them and calls them hypocrites,complex
judas iscariot one of the twelve apostles secretly strikes a bargain with the jewish elders agreeing to betray jesus to them for silver coins,complex
the gospel of john recounts of two other feasts in which jesus taught in jerusalem before the passion week john : – :,complex
in bethany a village near jerusalem jesus raises lazarus from the dead,complex
this potent sign increases the tension with authorities who conspire to kill him john,complex
mary of bethany anoints jesus ' feet foreshadowing his entombment,complex
jesus then makes his messianic entry into jerusalem,complex
the cheering crowds greeting jesus as he enters jerusalem add to the animosity between him and the establishment,complex
in john jesus has already cleansed the second temple during an earlier passover visit to jerusalem,complex
john next recounts jesus ' last supper with his disciples,complex
the last supper is the final meal that jesus shares with his apostles in jerusalem before his crucifixion,complex
the last supper is mentioned in all four canonical gospels paul 's first epistle to the corinthians : – also refers to it,complex
during the meal jesus predicts that one of his apostles will betray him,complex
despite each apostle 's assertion that he would not betray him jesus reiterates that the betrayer would be one of those present,complex
matthew : – and john : – specifically identify judas as the traitor,complex
in the synoptics jesus takes bread breaks it and gives it to the disciples saying this is my body which is given for you,complex
he then has them all drink from a cup saying this cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood luke : –,complex
the christian sacrament or ordinance of the eucharist is based on these events,complex
although the gospel of john does not include a description of the bread-and-wine ritual during the last supper most scholars agree that john : – the bread of life discourse has a eucharistic character and resonates with the institution narratives in the synoptic gospels and in the pauline writings on the last supper,complex
in all four gospels jesus predicts that peter will deny knowledge of him three times before the rooster crows the next morning,complex
in luke and john the prediction is made during the supper luke : john :,complex
in matthew and mark the prediction is made after the supper jesus also predicts that all his disciples will desert him matthew : – mark : –,complex
the gospel of john provides the only account of jesus washing his disciples ' feet after the meal,complex
john also includes a long sermon by jesus preparing his disciples now without judas for his departure,complex
chapters – of the gospel of john are known as the farewell discourse and are a significant source of christological content,complex
in the synoptics jesus and his disciples go to the garden gethsemane where jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal,complex
then judas comes with an armed mob sent by the chief priests scribes and elders,complex
he kisses jesus to identify him to the crowd which then arrests jesus,complex
in an attempt to stop them an unnamed disciple of jesus uses a sword to cut off the ear of a man in the crowd,complex
after jesus ' arrest his disciples go into hiding and peter when questioned thrice denies knowing jesus,complex
after the third denial peter hears the rooster crow and recalls jesus ' prediction about his denial,complex
peter then weeps bitterly,complex
in john : – jesus does not pray to be spared his crucifixion as the gospel portrays him as scarcely touched by such human weakness,complex
the people who arrest him are roman soldiers and temple guards,complex
instead of being betrayed by a kiss jesus proclaims his identity and when he does the soldiers and officers fall to the ground,complex
the gospel identifies peter as the disciple who used the sword and jesus rebukes him for it,complex
after his arrest jesus is taken to the sanhedrin a jewish judicial body,complex
the gospel accounts differ on the details of the trials,complex
in matthew : mark : and luke : jesus is taken to the house of the high priest caiaphas where he is mocked and beaten that night,complex
early the next morning the chief priests and scribes lead jesus away into their council,complex
john : – states that jesus is first taken to annas caiaphas ' father-in-law and then to the high priest,complex
during the trials jesus speaks very little mounts no defense and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the priests ' questions prompting an officer to slap him,complex
in matthew : jesus ' unresponsiveness leads caiaphas to ask him have you no answer ? in mark : the high priest then asks jesus are you the messiah the son of the blessed one ? jesus replies i am and then predicts the coming of the son of man,complex
this provokes caiaphas to tear his own robe in anger and to accuse jesus of blasphemy,complex
in matthew and luke jesus ' answer is more ambiguous : in matthew : he responds you have said so and in luke : he says you say that i am,complex
the jewish elders take jesus to pilate 's court and ask the roman governor pontius pilate to judge and condemn jesus accusing him of claiming to be the king of the jews,complex
the use of the word king is central to the discussion between jesus and pilate,complex
in john : jesus states my kingdom is not from this world but he does not unequivocally deny being the king of the jews,complex
in luke : – pilate realizes that jesus is a galilean and thus comes under the jurisdiction of herod antipas the tetrarch of galilee and perea,complex
pilate sends jesus to herod to be tried but jesus says almost nothing in response to herod 's questions,complex
herod and his soldiers mock jesus put an expensive robe on him to make him look like a king and return him to pilate who then calls together the jewish elders and announces that he has not found this man guilty,complex
observing a passover custom of the time pilate allows one prisoner chosen by the crowd to be released,complex
he gives the people a choice between jesus and a murderer called barabbas בר-אבא or bar-abbâ son of the father from the common given name abba : 'father ',complex
persuaded by the elders matthew : the mob chooses to release barabbas and crucify jesus,complex
pilate writes a sign in hebrew latin and greek that reads jesus of nazareth the king of the jews abbreviated as inri in depictions to be affixed to jesus ' cross john : – then scourges jesus and sends him to be crucified,complex
the soldiers place a crown of thorns on jesus ' head and ridicule him as the king of the jews,complex
they beat and taunt him before taking him to calvary also called golgotha for crucifixion,complex
jesus ' crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels,complex
after the trials jesus is led to calvary carrying his cross the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the via dolorosa,complex
the three synoptic gospels indicate that simon of cyrene assists him having been compelled by the romans to do so,complex
in luke : – jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their children,complex
the eventual demarcation of philosophy from science was made possible by the notion that philosophy 's core was theory of knowledge a theory distinct from the sciences because it was their foundation,complex
without this idea of a theory of knowledge it is hard to imagine what philosophy could have been in the age of modern science,complex
the definition of knowledge is a matter of ongoing debate among philosophers in the field of epistemology,complex
the classical definition described but not ultimately endorsed by plato specifies that a statement must meet three criteria in order to be considered knowledge : it must be justified true and believed,complex
some claim that these conditions are not sufficient as gettier case examples allegedly demonstrate,complex
there are a number of alternatives proposed including robert nozick 's arguments for a requirement that knowledge 'tracks the truth ' and simon blackburn 's additional requirement that we do not want to say that those who meet any of these conditions 'through a defect flaw or failure ' have knowledge,complex
richard kirkham suggests that our definition of knowledge requires that the evidence for the belief necessitates its truth,complex
in contrast to this approach ludwig wittgenstein observed following moore 's paradox that one can say he believes it but it is n't so but not he knows it but it is n't so,complex
he goes on to argue that these do not correspond to distinct mental states but rather to distinct ways of talking about conviction,complex
what is different here is not the mental state of the speaker but the activity in which they are engaged,complex
for example on this account to know that the kettle is boiling is not to be in a particular state of mind but to perform a particular task with the statement that the kettle is boiling,complex
the earliest written form of the germanic word god comes from the th-century christian codex argenteus,complex
the english word itself is derived from the proto-germanic ǥuđan,complex
the reconstructed proto-indo-european form ǵhu-tó-m was likely based on the root ǵhauə- which meant either to call or to invoke,complex
the germanic words for god were originally neuter—applying to both genders—but during the process of the christianization of the germanic peoples from their indigenous germanic paganism the words became a masculine syntactic form,complex
in the english language capitalization is used for names by which a god is known including 'god ',complex
consequently the capitalized form of god is not used for multiple gods polytheism or when used to refer to the generic idea of a deity,complex
the english word god and its counterparts in other languages are normally used for any and all conceptions and in spite of significant differences between religions the term remains an english translation common to all,complex
the same holds for hebrew el but in judaism god is also given a proper name the tetragrammaton yhwh in origin possibly the name of an edomite or midianite deity yahweh,complex
in many translations of the bible when the word lord is in all capitals it signifies that the word represents the tetragrammaton,complex
allāh arabic : الله‎ is the arabic term with no plural used by muslims and arabic speaking christians and jews meaning the god with the first letter capitalized while ʾilāh arabic : إله‎ is the term used for a deity or a god in general,complex
god may also be given a proper name in monotheistic currents of hinduism which emphasize the personal nature of god with early references to his name as krishna-vasudeva in bhagavata or later vishnu and hari,complex
ahura mazda is the name for god used in zoroastrianism,complex
mazda or rather the avestan stem-form mazdā- nominative mazdå reflects proto-iranian mazdāh female,complex
it is generally taken to be the proper name of the spirit and like its sanskrit cognate medhā means intelligence or wisdom,complex
both the avestan and sanskrit words reflect proto-indo-iranian mazdhā- from proto-indo-european mn̩sdʰeh literally meaning placing dʰeh one 's mind mn̩-s hence wise,complex
waheguru punjabi : vāhigurū is a term most often used in sikhism to refer to god,complex
it means wonderful teacher in the punjabi language,complex
vāhi a middle persian borrowing means wonderful and guru sanskrit : guru is a term denoting teacher,complex
waheguru is also described by some as an experience of ecstasy which is beyond all descriptions,complex
the most common usage of the word waheguru is in the greeting sikhs use with each other : baha the greatest name for god in the baha'i faith is arabic for all-glorious,complex
there is no clear consensus on the nature or the existence of god,complex
the abrahamic conceptions of god include the monotheistic definition of god in judaism the trinitarian view of christians and the islamic concept of god,complex
the dharmic religions differ in their view of the divine : views of god in hinduism vary by region sect and caste ranging from monotheistic to polytheistic,complex
many polytheistic religions share the idea of a creator deity although having a name other than god and without all of the other roles attributed to a singular god by monotheistic religions,complex
jainism is polytheistic and non-creationist,complex
depending on one 's interpretation and tradition buddhism can be conceived as being either atheistic non-theistic pantheistic panentheistic or polytheistic,complex
monotheists hold that there is only one god and may claim that the one true god is worshiped in different religions under different names,complex
the view that all theists actually worship the same god whether they know it or not is especially emphasized in the bahá'í faith hinduism and sikhism,complex
in christianity the doctrine of the trinity describes god as one god in three divine persons each of the three persons is god himself,complex
the most holy trinity comprises god the father god the son which is jesus christ god and god the holy spirit,complex
in the past centuries this fundamental mystery of the christian faith was also summarized by the latin formula sancta trinitas unus deus holy trinity unique god reported in the litanias lauretanas,complex
islam 's most fundamental concept is tawhid meaning oneness or uniqueness,complex
god is described in the quran as : say : he is allah the one and only allah the eternal absolute he begetteth not nor is he begotten and there is none like unto him,complex
muslims repudiate the christian doctrine of the trinity and the divinity of jesus comparing it to polytheism,complex
in islam god is transcendent and does not resemble any of his creations in any way,complex
thus muslims are not iconodules and are not expected to visualize god,complex
henotheism is the belief and worship of a single god while accepting the existence or possible existence of other deities,complex
theism generally holds that god exists realistically objectively and independently of human thought that god created and sustains everything that god is omnipotent and eternal and that god is personal and interacting with the universe through for example religious experience and the prayers of humans,complex
theism holds that god is both transcendent and immanent thus god is simultaneously infinite and in some way present in the affairs of the world,complex
not all theists subscribe to all of these propositions but each usually subscribes to some of them see by way of comparison family resemblance,complex
catholic theology holds that god is infinitely simple and is not involuntarily subject to time,complex
most theists hold that god is omnipotent omniscient and benevolent although this belief raises questions about god 's responsibility for evil and suffering in the world,complex
some theists ascribe to god a self-conscious or purposeful limiting of omnipotence omniscience or benevolence,complex
open theism by contrast contends that due to the nature of time god 's omniscience does not mean the deity can predict the future,complex
theism is sometimes used to refer in general to any belief in a god or gods i,complex
e,complex
monotheism or polytheism,complex
deism holds that god is wholly transcendent : god exists but does not intervene in the world beyond what was necessary to create it,complex
in this view god is not anthropomorphic and neither answers prayers nor produces miracles,complex
common in deism is a belief that god has no interest in humanity and may not even be aware of humanity,complex
pandeism combines deism with pantheistic beliefs,complex
pandeism is proposed to explain as to deism why god would create a universe and then abandon it and as to pantheism the origin and purpose of the universe,complex
the modern english word soul derived from old english sáwol sáwel was first attested in the th century poem beowulf v,complex
and in the vespasian psalter,complex
,complex
it is cognate with other german and baltic terms for the same idea including gothic saiwala old high german sêula sêla old saxon sêola old low franconian sêla sîla old norse sála and lithuanian siela,complex
deeper etymology of the germanic word is unclear,complex
the original concept behind the germanic root is thought to mean “ coming from or belonging to the sea or lake ” because of the germanic and pre-celtic belief in souls emerging from and returning to sacred lakes old saxon sêola soul compared to old saxon sêo sea,complex
the koine greek septuagint uses ψυχή psyche to translate hebrew נפש nephesh meaning life vital breath and specifically refers to a mortal physical life but in english it is variously translated as soul self life creature person appetite mind living being desire emotion passion an example can be found in genesis : : hebrew – וַיִּבְרָא אֱלֹהִים אֶת-הַתַּנִּינִם הַגְּדֹלִים וְאֵת כָּל-נֶפֶשׁ הַחַיָּה הָרֹמֶשֶׂת septuagint – καὶ ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς τὰ κήτη τὰ μεγάλα καὶ πᾶσαν ψυχὴν ζῴων ἑρπετῶν,complex
vulgate – creavitque deus cete grandia et omnem animam viventem atque motabilem,complex
authorized king james version – and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth,complex
the koine greek word ψυχή psychē life spirit consciousness is derived from a verb meaning to cool to blow and hence refers to the breath as opposed to σῶμα soma meaning body,complex
psychē occurs juxtaposed to σῶμα as seen in matthew : : greek – καὶ μὴ φοβεῖσθε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀποκτεννόντων τὸ σῶμα τὴν δὲ ψυχὴν μὴ δυναμένων ἀποκτεῖναι· φοβεῖσθε δὲ μᾶλλον τὸν δυνάμενον καὶ ψυχὴν καὶ σῶμα ἀπολέσαι ἐν γεέννῃ,complex
vulgate – et nolite timere eos qui occidunt corpus animam autem non possunt occidere sed potius eum timete qui potest et animam et corpus perdere in gehennam,complex
authorized king james version kjv – and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul : but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell,complex
paul the apostle used ψυχή psychē and πνεῦμα pneuma specifically to distinguish between the jewish notions of נפש nephesh and רוח ruah spirit also in the septuagint e,complex
g,complex
genesis : רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים = πνεῦμα θεοῦ = spiritus dei = the spirit of god,complex
,complex
in the ancient egyptian religion an individual was believed to be made up of various elements some physical and some spiritual,complex
unlike other ancient near eastern gods the hebrew god is portrayed as unitary and solitary consequently the hebrew god 's principal relationships are not with other gods but with the world and more specifically with the people he created,complex
judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism : the belief that god is one and is concerned with the actions of mankind,complex
according to the tanakh hebrew bible god promised abraham to make of his offspring a great nation,complex
many generations later he commanded the nation of israel to love and worship only one god that is the jewish nation is to reciprocate god 's concern for the world,complex
he also commanded the jewish people to love one another that is jews are to imitate god 's love for people,complex
these commandments are but two of a large corpus of commandments and laws that constitute this covenant which is the substance of judaism,complex
thus although there is an esoteric tradition in judaism kabbalah rabbinic scholar max kadushin has characterized normative judaism as normal mysticism because it involves everyday personal experiences of god through ways or modes that are common to all jews,complex
this is played out through the observance of the halakha jewish law and given verbal expression in the birkat ha-mizvot the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled,complex
the ordinary familiar everyday things and occurrences we have constitute occasions for the experience of god,complex
such things as one 's daily sustenance the very day itself are felt as manifestations of god 's loving-kindness calling for the berakhot,complex
kedushah holiness which is nothing else than the imitation of god is concerned with daily conduct with being gracious and merciful with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry adultery and the shedding of blood,complex
the birkat ha-mitzwot evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite but the objects employed in the majority of these rites are non-holy and of general character while the several holy objects are non-theurgic,complex
and not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of god,complex
everything that happens to a man evokes that experience evil as well as good for a berakah is said also at evil tidings,complex
hence although the experience of god is like none other the occasions for experiencing him for having a consciousness of him are manifold even if we consider only those that call for berakot,complex
whereas jewish philosophers often debate whether god is immanent or transcendent and whether people have free will or their lives are determined halakha is a system through which any jew acts to bring god into the world,complex
ethical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of judaism,complex
however monotheism has not always been followed in practice,complex
the jewish bible tanakh records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in ancient israel,complex
in the greco-roman era many different interpretations of monotheism existed in judaism including the interpretations that gave rise to christianity,complex
moreover some have argued that judaism is a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in god,complex
for some observance of jewish law is more important than belief in god per se,complex
in modern times some liberal jewish movements do not accept the existence of a personified deity active in history,complex
the debate about whether one can speak of authentic or normative judaism is not only a debate among religious jews but also among historians,complex
scholars throughout jewish history have proposed numerous formulations of judaism 's core tenets all of which have met with criticism,complex
the most popular formulation is maimonides ' thirteen principles of faith developed in the th century,complex
according to maimonides any jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic,complex
jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from maimonides ' principles,complex
in maimonides ' time his list of tenets was criticized by hasdai crescas and joseph albo,complex
albo and the raavad argued that maimonides ' principles contained too many items that while true were not fundamentals of the faith,complex
along these lines the ancient historian josephus emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs associating apostasy with a failure to observe jewish law and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to judaism included circumcision and adherence to traditional customs,complex
maimonides ' principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries,complex
later two poetic restatements of these principles ani ma'amin and yigdal became integrated into many jewish liturgies leading to their eventual near-universal acceptance,complex
in modern times judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma,complex
because of this many different variations on the basic beliefs are considered within the scope of judaism,complex
even so all jewish religious movements are to a greater or lesser extent based on the principles of the hebrew bible and various commentaries such as the talmud and midrash,complex
judaism also universally recognizes the biblical covenant between god and the patriarch abraham as well as the additional aspects of the covenant revealed to moses who is considered judaism 's greatest prophet,complex
in the mishnah a core text of rabbinic judaism acceptance of the divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential aspect of judaism and those who reject the covenant forfeit their share in the world to come,complex
establishing the core tenets of judaism in the modern era is even more difficult given the number and diversity of the contemporary jewish denominations,complex
even if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth century the matter remains complicated,complex
thus for instance joseph soloveitchik 's associated with the modern orthodox movement answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of judaism with following the halakha whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the holiness down to the world,complex
mordecai kaplan the founder of the reconstructionist judaism abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying judaism with civilization and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas he tries to embrace as many jewish denominations as possible,complex
in turn solomon schechter 's conservative judaism was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of torah in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the law performed by means of the creative interpretation,complex
finally david philipson draws the outlines of the reform movement in judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions similar to that of the conservative movement,complex
the following is a basic structured list of the central works of jewish practice and thought,complex
tanakh hebrew bible and rabbinic literature mesorah targum jewish biblical exegesis also see midrash below works of the talmudic era classic rabbinic literature mishnah and commentaries tosefta and the minor tractates talmud : the babylonian talmud and commentaries jerusalem talmud and commentaries midrashic literature : halakhic midrash aggadic midrash halakhic literature major codes of jewish law and custom mishneh torah and commentaries tur and commentaries shulchan aruch and commentaries responsa literature jewish thought and ethics jewish philosophy musar literature and other works of jewish ethics kabbalah hasidic works siddur and jewish liturgy piyyut classical jewish poetrymany traditional jewish texts are available online in various torah databases electronic versions of the traditional jewish bookshelf,complex
many of these have advanced search options available,complex
the basis of jewish law and tradition halakha is the torah also known as the pentateuch or the five books of moses,complex
according to rabbinic tradition there are commandments in the torah,complex
some of these laws are directed only to men or to women some only to the ancient priestly groups the kohanim and leviyim members of the tribe of levi some only to farmers within the land of israel,complex
many laws were only applicable when the temple in jerusalem existed and only of these commandments are still applicable today,complex
while there have been jewish groups whose beliefs were based on the written text of the torah alone e,complex
g,complex
the sadducees and the karaites most jews believe in the oral law,complex
these oral traditions were transmitted by the pharisee school of thought of ancient judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis,complex
according to rabbinical jewish tradition god gave both the written law the torah and the oral law to moses on mount sinai,complex
the oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by god to moses and from him transmitted and taught to the sages rabbinic leaders of each subsequent generation,complex
for centuries the torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition,complex
fearing that the oral teachings might be forgotten rabbi judah hanasi undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the mishnah,complex
the mishnah consists of tractates codifying jewish law which are the basis of the talmud,complex
according to abraham ben david the mishnah was compiled by rabbi judah hanasi after the destruction of jerusalem in anno mundi which corresponds to ce,complex
over the next four centuries the mishnah underwent discussion and debate in both of the world 's major jewish communities in israel and babylonia,complex
the commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into the two talmuds the jerusalem talmud talmud yerushalmi and the babylonian talmud talmud bavli,complex
these have been further expounded by commentaries of various torah scholars during the ages,complex
in the text of the torah many words are left undefined and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions,complex
such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the written law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition illustrating the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the details from other i,complex
e,complex
oral sources,complex
halakha the rabbinic jewish way of life then is based on a combined reading of the torah and the oral tradition—the mishnah the halakhic midrash the talmud and its commentaries,complex
the halakha has developed slowly through a precedent-based system,complex
the literature of questions to rabbis and their considered answers is referred to as responsa in hebrew sheelot u-teshuvot,complex
over time as practices develop codes of jewish law are written that are based on the responsa the most important code the shulchan aruch largely determines orthodox religious practice today,complex
jewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and jewish theology,complex
major jewish philosophers include solomon ibn gabirol saadia gaon judah halevi maimonides and gersonides,complex
major changes occurred in response to the enlightenment late th to early th century leading to the post-enlightenment jewish philosophers,complex
modern jewish philosophy consists of both orthodox and non-orthodox oriented philosophy,complex
notable among orthodox jewish philosophers are eliyahu eliezer dessler joseph b,complex
soloveitchik and yitzchok hutner,complex
well-known non-orthodox jewish philosophers include martin buber franz rosenzweig mordecai kaplan abraham joshua heschel will herberg and emmanuel lévinas,complex
orthodox and many other jews do not believe that the revealed torah consists solely of its written contents but of its interpretations as well,complex
the study of torah in its widest sense to include both poetry narrative and law and both the hebrew bible and the talmud is in judaism itself a sacred act of central importance,complex
for the sages of the mishnah and talmud and for their successors today the study of torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of god 's revelation but an end in itself,complex
according to the talmud these are the things for which a person enjoys the dividends in this world while the principal remains for the person to enjoy in the world to come they are : honoring parents loving deeds of kindness and making peace between one person and another,complex
but the study of the torah is equal to them all,complex
talmud shabbat a,complex
in judaism the study of torah can be a means of experiencing god,complex
reflecting on the contribution of the amoraim and tanaim to contemporary judaism professor jacob neusner observed : the rabbi 's logical and rational inquiry is not mere logic-chopping,complex
it is a most serious and substantive effort to locate in trivialities the fundamental principles of the revealed will of god to guide and sanctify the most specific and concrete actions in the workaday world,complex
,complex
here is the mystery of talmudic judaism : the alien and remote conviction that the intellect is an instrument not of unbelief and desacralization but of sanctification,complex
to study the written torah and the oral torah in light of each other is thus also to study how to study the word of god,complex
in the study of torah the sages formulated and followed various logical and hermeneutical principles,complex
according to david stern all rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms : first the belief in the omni-significance of scripture in the meaningfulness of its every word letter even according to one famous report scribal flourish second the claim of the essential unity of scripture as the expression of the single divine will,complex
these two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations,complex
according to the talmud a single verse has several meanings but no two verses hold the same meaning,complex
it was taught in the school of r,complex
ishmael : 'behold my word is like fire—declares the lord—and like a hammer that shatters rock ' jer :,complex
just as this hammer produces many sparks when it strikes the rock so a single verse has several meanings,complex
talmud sanhedrin a,complex
observant jews thus view the torah as dynamic because it contains within it a host of interpretationsaccording to rabbinic tradition all valid interpretations of the written torah were revealed to moses at sinai in oral form and handed down from teacher to pupil the oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the talmud itself,complex
when different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by god to moses at sinai,complex
thus hillel called attention to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws baraita at the beginning of sifra r,complex
ishmael thirteen baraita at the beginning of sifra this collection is largely an amplification of that of hillel,complex
eliezer b,complex

nevertheless r,complex
ishmael 's principles are perhaps the ones most widely known they constitute an important and one of judaism 's earliest contributions to logic hermeneutics and jurisprudence,complex
judah hadassi incorporated ishmael 's principles into karaite judaism in the th century,complex
today r,complex
ishmael 's principles are incorporated into the jewish prayer book to be read by observant jews on a daily basis,complex

the term judaism derives from iudaismus a latinized form of the ancient greek ioudaismos ἰουδαϊσμός from the verb ἰουδαΐζειν to side with or imitate the [ judeans ],complex
its ultimate source was the hebrew יהודה yehudah judah which is also the source of the hebrew term for judaism : יַהֲדוּת yahadut,complex
the term ἰουδαϊσμός first appears in the hellenistic greek book of maccabees in the nd century bce,complex
in the context of the age and period it meant seeking or forming part of a cultural entity and it resembled its antonym hellenismos a word that signified a people 's submission to hellenic greek cultural norms,complex
the conflict between iudaismos and hellenismos lay behind the maccabean revolt and hence the invention of the term iudaismos,complex
shaye j,complex
d,complex
cohen writes in his book the beginnings of jewishness : we are tempted of course to translate [ ioudaïsmós ] as judaism but this translation is too narrow because in this first occurrence of the term ioudaïsmós has not yet been reduced to the designation of a religion,complex
it means rather the aggregate of all those characteristics that makes judaeans judaean or jews jewish,complex
among these characteristics to be sure are practices and beliefs that we would today call religious but these practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term,complex
thus ioudaïsmós should be translated not as judaism but as judaeanness,complex
according to the oxford english dictionary the earliest citation in english where the term was used to mean the profession or practice of the jewish religion the religious system or polity of the jews is robert fabyan 's the newe cronycles of englande and of fraunce,complex
judaism as a direct translation of the latin iudaismus first occurred in a english translation of the apocrypha deuterocanon in catholic and eastern orthodoxy macc,complex
ii,complex
: those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for iudaisme,complex
according to daniel boyarin the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to judaism itself and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in platonic philosophy and that permeated hellenistic judaism,complex
consequently in his view judaism does not fit easily into conventional western categories such as religion ethnicity or culture,complex
boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of judaism 's more than -year history predates the rise of western culture and occurred outside the west that is europe particularly medieval and modern europe,complex
during this time jews experienced slavery anarchic and theocratic self-government conquest occupation and exile,complex
in the diaspora they were in contact with and influenced by ancient egyptian babylonian persian and hellenic cultures as well as modern movements such as the enlightenment see haskalah and the rise of nationalism which would bear fruit in the form of a jewish state in their ancient homeland the land of israel,complex
they also saw an elite population convert to judaism the khazars only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of rus and then the mongols,complex
thus boyarin has argued that jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity because it is not national not genealogical not religious but all of these in dialectical tension,complex
in contrast to this point of view practices such as humanistic judaism reject the religious aspects of judaism while retaining certain cultural traditions,complex
according to rabbinic judaism a jew is anyone who was either born of a jewish mother or who converted to judaism in accordance with jewish law,complex
reconstructionist judaism and the larger denominations of worldwide progressive judaism also known as liberal or reform judaism accept the child as jewish if one of the parents is jewish if the parents raise the child with a jewish identity but not the smaller regional branches,complex
all mainstream forms of judaism today are open to sincere converts although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the talmud,complex
the conversion process is evaluated by an authority and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge,complex
converts are called ben abraham or bat abraham son or daughter of abraham,complex
conversions have on occasion been overturned,complex
in israel 's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of jews mostly from russian immigrant families even though they had been approved by an orthodox rabbi,complex
rabbinical judaism maintains that a jew whether by birth or conversion is a jew forever,complex
thus a jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional judaism to be jewish,complex
according to some sources the reform movement has maintained that a jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a jew and the israeli government has also taken that stance after supreme court cases and statutes,complex
however the reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried and different situations call for consideration and differing actions,complex
for example jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to judaism without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the jewish community and a proselyte who has become an apostate remains nevertheless a jew,complex
karaite judaism believes that jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent,complex
although a minority of modern karaites believe that jewish identity requires that both parents be jewish and not only the father,complex
they argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the torah went according to the male line,complex
the question of what determines jewish identity in the state of israel was given new impetus when in the s david ben-gurion requested opinions on mihu yehudi who is a jew from jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions,complex
this is still not settled and occasionally resurfaces in israeli politics,complex
historical definitions of jewish identity have traditionally been based on halakhic definitions of matrilineal descent and halakhic conversions,complex
historical definitions of who is a jew date back to the codification of the oral torah into the babylonian talmud around ce,complex
interpretations of sections of the tanakh such as deuteronomy : – by jewish sages are used as a warning against intermarriage between jews and canaanites because [ the non-jewish husband ] will cause your child to turn away from me and they will worship the gods i,complex
e,complex
idols of others,complex
leviticus : says that the son in a marriage between a hebrew woman and an egyptian man is of the community of israel,complex
this is complemented by ezra : – where israelites returning from babylon vow to put aside their gentile wives and their children,complex
a popular theory is that the rape of jewish women in captivity brought about the law of jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line although scholars challenge this theory citing the talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period,complex
since the anti-religious haskalah movement of the late th and th centuries halakhic interpretations of jewish identity have been challenged,complex
the total number of jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of who is a jew is problematic not all jews identify themselves as jewish and some who identify as jewish are not considered so by other jews,complex
according to the jewish year book the global jewish population in was around million,complex
the latest available data is from the world jewish population survey of and the jewish year calendar,complex
in according to the jewish population survey there were,complex
million jews around the world,complex

rabbinic judaism or in some christian traditions rabbinism hebrew : yahadut rabanit – יהדות רבנית has been the mainstream form of judaism since the th century ce after the codification of the talmud,complex
it is characterised by the belief that the written torah written law can not be correctly interpreted without reference to the oral torah and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the law,complex
the jewish enlightenment of the late th century resulted in the division of ashkenazi western jewry into religious movements or denominations especially in north america and anglophone countries,complex
the main denominations today outside israel where the situation is rather different are orthodox conservative and reform,complex
orthodox judaism holds that both the written and oral torah were divinely revealed to moses and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging,complex
orthodox jews generally consider commentaries on the shulchan aruch a condensed codification of halakha that largely favored sephardic traditions to be the definitive codification of jewish law,complex
orthodoxy places a high importance on maimonides ' principles as a definition of jewish faith,complex
orthodoxy is often divided into modern orthodox judaism and haredi judaism,complex
haredi judaism is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-jewish disciplines and it may be distinguished from modern orthodox judaism in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices,complex
subsets of haredi judaism include hasidic judaism which is rooted in the kabbalah and distinguished by reliance on a rebbe or religious teacher and sephardic haredi judaism which emerged among sephardic asian and north african jews in israel,complex
conservative judaism is characterized by a commitment to traditional jewish laws and customs including observance of shabbat and kashrut a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of jewish principles of faith a positive attitude toward modern culture and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering jewish religious texts,complex
conservative judaism teaches that jewish law is not static but has always developed in response to changing conditions,complex
it holds that the torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by god and reflecting his will but rejects the orthodox position that it was dictated by god to moses,complex
conservative judaism holds that the oral law is divine and normative but holds that both the written and oral law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions,complex
reform judaism called liberal or progressive judaism in many countries defines judaism in relatively universalist terms rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the torah while observing moral laws and emphasizes the ethical call of the prophets,complex
reform judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular along with hebrew in many cases and emphasizes personal connection to jewish tradition,complex
reconstructionist judaism like reform judaism does not hold that jewish law as such requires observance but unlike reform reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow,complex
jewish renewal is a recent north american movement which focuses on spirituality and social justice but does not address issues of jewish law,complex
men and women participate equally in prayer,complex
humanistic judaism is a small non-theistic movement centered in north america and israel that emphasizes jewish culture and history as the sources of jewish identity,complex
while traditions and customs see also sephardic law and customs vary between discrete communities it can be said that sephardi and mizrahi jewish communities do not generally adhere to the movement framework popular in and among ashkenazi jewry,complex
historically sephardi and mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a big tent approach,complex
this is particularly the case in contemporary israel which is home to the largest communities of sephardi and mizrahi jews in the world,complex
however individual sephardi and mizrahi jews may be members of or attend synagogues that do adhere to one ashkenazi-inflected movement or another,complex
sephardi and mizrahi observance of judaism tends toward the conservative and prayer rites are reflective of this with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception,complex
observant sephardim may follow the teachings of a particular rabbi or school of thought for example the sephardic chief rabbi of israel,complex
most jewish israelis classify themselves as secular hiloni traditional masorti religious dati or haredi,complex
the term secular is more popular as a self-description among israeli families of western european origin whose jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice,complex
this portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life be it of the official israeli rabbinate orthodox or of the liberal movements common to diaspora judaism reform conservative,complex
the term traditional masorti is most common as a self-description among israeli families of eastern origin i,complex
e,complex
the middle east central asia and north africa,complex
this term as commonly used has nothing to do with the conservative judaism which also names itself masorti outside north america,complex
there is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways secular and traditional are used in israel : they often overlap and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance,complex
the term orthodox is not popular in israeli discourse although the percentage of jews who come under that category is far greater than in the diaspora,complex
what would be called orthodox in the diaspora includes what is commonly called dati religious or haredi ultra-orthodox in israel,complex
the former term includes what is called religious zionism or the national religious community as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as haredi-leumi nationalist haredi or hardal which combines a largely haredi lifestyle with nationalist ideology,complex
some people in yiddish also refer to observant orthodox jews as frum as opposed to frei more liberal jews,complex
haredi applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines : lithuanian non-hasidic haredim of ashkenazic origin hasidic haredim of ashkenazic origin and sephardic haredim,complex
karaite judaism defines itself as the remnants of the non-rabbinic jewish sects of the second temple period such as the sadducees,complex
the karaites scripturalists accept only the hebrew bible and what they view as the peshat simple meaning they do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative,complex
some european karaites do not see themselves as part of the jewish community at all although most do,complex
the samaritans a very small community located entirely around mount gerizim in the nablus/shechem region of the west bank and in holon near tel aviv in israel regard themselves as the descendants of the israelites of the iron age kingdom of israel,complex
their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written torah five books of moses which they view as the only authoritative scripture with a special regard also for the samaritan book of joshua,complex
see also : haymanot beta israel,complex
haymanot meaning religion in ge'ez and amharic refers the judaism practiced by ethiopian jews,complex
this version of judaism differs substantially from rabbinic karaite and samaritan judaisms ethiopian jews having diverged from their coreligionists earlier,complex
sacred scriptures the orit are written in ge'ez not hebrew and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the orit without explication from ancillary commentaries,complex
holidays also differ with some rabbinic holidays not observed in ethiopian jewish communities and some additional holidays like sigd,complex
,complex
jewish ethics may be guided by halakhic traditions by other moral principles or by central jewish virtues,complex
jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice truth peace loving-kindness chesed compassion humility and self-respect,complex
specific jewish ethical practices include practices of charity tzedakah and refraining from negative speech lashon hara,complex
proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among jews,complex
traditionally jews recite prayers three times daily shacharit mincha and ma'ariv with a fourth prayer mussaf added on shabbat and holidays,complex
at the heart of each service is the amidah or shemoneh esrei,complex
another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith the shema yisrael or shema,complex
the shema is the recitation of a verse from the torah deuteronomy : : shema yisrael adonai eloheinu adonai echad—hear o israel the lord is our god the lord is one most of the prayers in a traditional jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer although communal prayer is preferred,complex
communal prayer requires a quorum of ten adult jews called a minyan,complex
in nearly all orthodox and a few conservative circles only male jews are counted toward a minyan most conservative jews and members of other jewish denominations count female jews as well,complex
in addition to prayer services observant traditional jews recite prayers and benedictions throughout the day when performing various acts,complex
prayers are recited upon waking up in the morning before eating or drinking different foods after eating a meal and so on,complex
the approach to prayer varies among the jewish denominations,complex
differences can include the texts of prayers the frequency of prayer the number of prayers recited at various religious events the use of musical instruments and choral music and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular,complex
in general orthodox and conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition and reform and reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services,complex
also in most conservative synagogues and all reform and reconstructionist congregations women participate in prayer services on an equal basis with men including roles traditionally filled only by men such as reading from the torah,complex
in addition many reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs,complex
a kippah hebrew : כִּפָּה plural kippot yiddish : יאַרמלקע yarmulke is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many jews while praying eating reciting blessings or studying jewish religious texts and at all times by some jewish men,complex
in orthodox communities only men wear kippot in non-orthodox communities some women also wear kippot,complex
kippot range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head to a large snug cap that covers the whole crown,complex
tzitzit hebrew : צִיציִת ashkenazi pronunciation : tzitzis are special knotted fringes or tassels found on the four corners of the tallit hebrew : טַלִּית ashkenazi pronunciation : tallis or prayer shawl,complex
the tallit is worn by jewish men and some jewish women during the prayer service,complex
customs vary regarding when a jew begins wearing a tallit,complex
in the sephardi community boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age,complex
in some ashkenazi communities it is customary to wear one only after marriage,complex
a tallit katan small tallit is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day,complex
in some orthodox circles the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing,complex
tefillin hebrew : תְפִלִּין known in english as phylacteries from the greek word φυλακτήριον meaning safeguard or amulet are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps,complex
they are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant jewish men and some jewish women,complex
a kittel yiddish : קיטל a white knee-length overgarment is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional jews on the high holidays,complex
it is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the passover seder in some communities and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy,complex
jewish males are buried in a tallit and sometimes also a kittel which are part of the tachrichim burial garments,complex
jewish holidays are special days in the jewish calendar which celebrate moments in jewish history as well as central themes in the relationship between god and the world such as creation revelation and redemption,complex
shabbat the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on friday night to nightfall on saturday night commemorates god 's day of rest after six days of creation,complex
it plays a pivotal role in jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law,complex
at sundown on friday the woman of the house welcomes the shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing,complex
the evening meal begins with the kiddush a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine and the mohtzi a blessing recited over the bread,complex
it is customary to have challah two braided loaves of bread on the table,complex
during shabbat jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under categories of melakhah translated literally as work,complex
in fact the activities banned on the sabbath are not work in the usual sense : they include such actions as lighting a fire writing using money and carrying in the public domain,complex
the prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car which involves burning fuel and using electricity,complex
jewish holy days chaggim celebrate landmark events in jewish history such as the exodus from egypt and the giving of the torah and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle,complex
the three major festivals sukkot passover and shavuot are called regalim derived from the hebrew word regel or foot,complex
on the three regalim it was customary for the israelites to make pilgrimages to jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the temple,complex
passover pesach is a week-long holiday beginning on the evening of the th day of nisan the first month in the hebrew calendar that commemorates the exodus from egypt,complex
outside israel passover is celebrated for eight days,complex
in ancient times it coincided with the barley harvest,complex
it is the only holiday that centers on home-service the seder,complex
leavened products chametz are removed from the house prior to the holiday and are not consumed throughout the week,complex
homes are thoroughly cleaned to ensure no bread or bread by-products remain and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the seder,complex
matzo is eaten instead of bread,complex
shavuot pentecost or feast of weeks celebrates the revelation of the torah to the israelites on mount sinai,complex
also known as the festival of bikurim or first fruits it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest,complex
shavuot customs include all-night study marathons known as tikkun leil shavuot eating dairy foods cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites reading the book of ruth decorating homes and synagogues with greenery and wearing white clothing symbolizing purity,complex
one of the primary functions of the family involves providing a framework for the production and reproduction of persons biologically and socially,complex
this can occur through the sharing of material substances such as food the giving and receiving of care and nurture nurture kinship jural rights and obligations and moral and sentimental ties,complex
thus one 's experience of one 's family shifts over time,complex
from the perspective of children the family is a family of orientation : the family serves to locate children socially and plays a major role in their enculturation and socialization,complex
from the point of view of the parents the family is a family of procreation the goal of which is to produce and enculturate and socialize children,complex
however producing children is not the only function of the family in societies with a sexual division of labor marriage and the resulting relationship between two people it is necessary for the formation of an economically productive household,complex
christopher harris notes that the western conception of family is ambiguous and confused with the household as revealed in the different contexts in which the word is used,complex
olivia harris states this confusion is not accidental but indicative of the familial ideology of capitalist western countries that pass social legislation that insists members of a nuclear family should live together and that those not so related should not live together despite the ideological and legal pressures a large percentage of families do not conform to the ideal nuclear family type,complex
the total fertility rate of women varies from country to country from a high of,complex
children born/woman in niger to a low of,complex
the word comes from the same greek word from which the title of aristotle 's book politics πολιτικά polis also derives polis means affairs of the cities,complex
the book title was rendered in early modern english in the mid-th century as polettiques it became politics in modern english,complex
the singular politic first attested in english and comes from middle french politique in turn from latin politicus which is the latinization of the greek πολιτικός politikos meaning amongst others of for or relating to citizens civil civic belonging to the state in turn from πολίτης polites citizen and that from πόλις polis city,complex
formal politics refers to the operation of a constitutional system of government and publicly defined institutions and procedures,complex
political parties public policy or discussions about war and foreign affairs would fall under the category of formal politics,complex
many people view formal politics as something outside of themselves but that can still affect their daily lives,complex
semi-formal politics is politics in government associations such as neighborhood associations or student governments where student government political party politics is often important,complex
informal politics is understood as forming alliances exercising power and protecting and advancing particular ideas or goals,complex
generally this includes anything affecting one 's daily life such as the way an office or household is managed or how one person or group exercises influence over another,complex
informal politics is typically understood as everyday politics hence the idea that politics is everywhere,complex
the history of politics is reflected in the origin development and economics of the institutions of government,complex
the origin of the state is to be found in the development of the art of warfare,complex
historically speaking all political communities of the modern type owe their existence to successful warfare,complex
kings emperors and other types of monarchs in many countries including china and japan were considered divine,complex
of the institutions that ruled states that of kingship stood at the forefront until the american revolution put an end to the divine right of kings,complex
nevertheless the monarchy is among the longest-lasting political institutions dating as early as bc in sumeria to the st century ad british monarchy,complex
kingship becomes an institution through the institution of hereditary monarchy,complex
the king often even in absolute monarchies ruled his kingdom with the aid of an elite group of advisors a council without which he could not maintain power,complex
as these advisors and others outside the monarchy negotiated for power constitutional monarchies emerged which may be considered the germ of constitutional government,complex
the greatest of the king 's subordinates the earls and dukes in england and scotland the dukes and counts in the continent always sat as a right on the council,complex
a conqueror wages war upon the vanquished for vengeance or for plunder but an established kingdom exacts tribute,complex
one of the functions of the council is to keep the coffers of the king full,complex
another is the satisfaction of military service and the establishment of lordships by the king to satisfy the task of collecting taxes and soldiers,complex
,complex
there are many forms of political organization including states non-government organizations ngos and international organizations such as the united nations,complex
states are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the regime in power,complex
according to aristotle states are classified into monarchies aristocracies timocracies democracies oligarchies and tyrannies,complex
due to changes across the history of politics this classification has been abandoned,complex
all states are varieties of a single organizational form the sovereign state,complex
all the great powers of the modern world rule on the principle of sovereignty,complex
sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an autocratic government or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government,complex
constitutions are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government,complex
although a constitution is a written document there is also an unwritten constitution,complex
the unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative branch of government this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate,complex
england did set the fashion of written constitutions during the civil war but after the restoration abandoned them to be taken up later by the american colonies after their emancipation and then france after the revolution and the rest of europe including the european colonies,complex
the word money is believed to originate from a temple of juno on capitoline one of rome 's seven hills,complex
in the ancient world juno was often associated with money,complex
the temple of juno moneta at rome was the place where the mint of ancient rome was located,complex
the name juno may derive from the etruscan goddess uni which means the one unique unit union united and moneta either from the latin word monere remind warn or instruct or the greek word moneres alone unique,complex
in the western world a prevalent term for coin-money has been specie stemming from latin in specie meaning 'in kind',complex
the use of barter-like methods may date back to at least years ago though there is no evidence of a society or economy that relied primarily on barter,complex
instead non-monetary societies operated largely along the principles of gift economy and debt,complex
when barter did in fact occur it was usually between either complete strangers or potential enemies,complex
many cultures around the world eventually developed the use of commodity money,complex
the mesopotamian shekel was a unit of weight and relied on the mass of something like grains of barley,complex
the first usage of the term came from mesopotamia circa bc,complex
societies in the americas asia africa and australia used shell money – often the shells of the cowry cypraea moneta l,complex
or c,complex
annulus l,complex
according to herodotus the lydians were the first people to introduce the use of gold and silver coins,complex
it is thought by modern scholars that these first stamped coins were minted around – bc,complex
the system of commodity money eventually evolved into a system of representative money,complex
this occurred because gold and silver merchants or banks would issue receipts to their depositors – redeemable for the commodity money deposited,complex
eventually these receipts became generally accepted as a means of payment and were used as money,complex
paper money or banknotes were first used in china during the song dynasty,complex
these banknotes known as jiaozi evolved from promissory notes that had been used since the th century,complex
however they did not displace commodity money and were used alongside coins,complex
in the th century paper money became known in europe through the accounts of travelers such as marco polo and william of rubruck,complex
marco polo 's account of paper money during the yuan dynasty is the subject of a chapter of his book the travels of marco polo titled how the great kaan causeth the bark of trees made into something like paper to pass for money all over his country,complex
banknotes were first issued in europe by stockholms banco in and were again also used alongside coins,complex
the gold standard a monetary system where the medium of exchange are paper notes that are convertible into pre-set fixed quantities of gold replaced the use of gold coins as currency in the th–th centuries in europe,complex
these gold standard notes were made legal tender and redemption into gold coins was discouraged,complex
by the beginning of the th century almost all countries had adopted the gold standard backing their legal tender notes with fixed amounts of gold,complex
after world war ii and the bretton woods conference most countries adopted fiat currencies that were fixed to the u,complex
dollar,complex
the u,complex
dollar was in turn fixed to gold,complex
in the u,complex
government suspended the convertibility of the u,complex
dollar to gold,complex
after this many countries de-pegged their currencies from the u,complex
dollar and most of the world 's currencies became unbacked by anything except the governments ' fiat of legal tender and the ability to convert the money into goods via payment,complex
according to proponents of modern money theory fiat money is also backed by taxes,complex
by imposing taxes states create demand for the currency they issue,complex
in money and the mechanism of exchange william stanley jevons famously analyzed money in terms of four functions : a medium of exchange a common measure of value or unit of account a standard of value or standard of deferred payment and a store of value,complex
by jevons 's four functions of money were summarized in the couplet : money 's a matter of functions four a medium a measure a standard a store,complex
this couplet would later become widely popular in macroeconomics textbooks,complex
most modern textbooks now list only three functions that of medium of exchange unit of account and store of value not considering a standard of deferred payment as a distinguished function but rather subsuming it in the others,complex
there have been many historical disputes regarding the combination of money 's functions some arguing that they need more separation and that a single unit is insufficient to deal with them all,complex
one of these arguments is that the role of money as a medium of exchange is in conflict with its role as a store of value : its role as a store of value requires holding it without spending whereas its role as a medium of exchange requires it to circulate,complex
others argue that storing of value is just deferral of the exchange but does not diminish the fact that money is a medium of exchange that can be transported both across space and time,complex
the term financial capital is a more general and inclusive term for all liquid instruments whether or not they are a uniformly recognized tender,complex
when money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services it is performing a function as a medium of exchange,complex
it thereby avoids the inefficiencies of a barter system such as the coincidence of wants problem,complex
money 's most important usage is as a method for comparing the values of dissimilar objects,complex
a unit of account in economics is a standard numerical monetary unit of measurement of the market value of goods services and other transactions,complex
also known as a measure or standard of relative worth and deferred payment a unit of account is a necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt,complex
money acts as a standard measure and common denomination of trade,complex
it is thus a basis for quoting and bargaining of prices,complex
it is necessary for developing efficient accounting systems,complex
while standard of deferred payment is distinguished by some texts particularly older ones other texts subsume this under other functions,complex
a standard of deferred payment is an accepted way to settle a debt – a unit in which debts are denominated and the status of money as legal tender in those jurisdictions which have this concept states that it may function for the discharge of debts,complex
when debts are denominated in money the real value of debts may change due to inflation and deflation and for sovereign and international debts via debasement and devaluation,complex
to act as a store of value a money must be able to be reliably saved stored and retrieved – and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved,complex
the value of the money must also remain stable over time,complex
some have argued that inflation by reducing the value of money diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of value,complex
to fulfill its various functions money must have certain properties : fungibility : its individual units must be capable of mutual substitution i,complex

in the century prior to the un 's creation several international treaty organizations such as the international committee of the red cross was formed to ensure protection and assistance for victims of armed conflict and strife,complex
following the catastrophic loss of life in the first world war the paris peace conference established the league of nations with a brief to prevent war settle disputes and improve peoples ' lives across the globe,complex
however the league was ineffective as it failed to act against the japanese invasion of manchuria as in february nations voted for japan to withdraw from manchuria but japan voted against it and walked out of the league instead of withdrawing from manchuria,complex
it also failed against the second italo-ethiopian war as both italy and ethiopia are both members of the league so the league was unable to control italy or protect ethiopia,complex
therefore italy had conquered ethiopia,complex
it also failed in the japanese invasion of china in and german expansions under adolf hitler that culminated in the second world war,complex

latin and romance language root word mil-the first recorded use of the word military in english spelled militarie was in,complex
it comes from the latin militaris from latin miles meaning soldier through french but is of uncertain etymology one suggestion being derived from mil-it- – going in a body or mass,complex
the word is now identified as denoting someone that is skilled in use of weapons or engaged in military service or in warfare,complex
as a noun the military usually refers generally to a country 's armed forces or sometimes more specifically to the senior officers who command them,complex
in general it refers to the physicality of armed forces their personnel equipment and the physical area which they occupy,complex
as an adjective military originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering but it soon broadened to apply to land forces in general and anything to do with their profession,complex
the names of both the royal military academy and united states military academy reflect this,complex
however at about the time of the napoleonic wars 'military ' began to be used in reference to armed forces as a whole and in the st century expressions like 'military service ' 'military intelligence ' and 'military history ' encompass naval and air force aspects,complex
as such it now connotes any activity performed by armed force personnel,complex
military history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts not just the history of the state militaries,complex
it differs somewhat from the history of war with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology governments and geography,complex
military history has a number of facets,complex
one main facet is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes so as to more effectively wage war in the future,complex
another is to create a sense of military tradition which is used to create cohesive military forces,complex
still another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively,complex
human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and oral history of military conflicts war their participating armies and navies and more recently air forces,complex
there are two types of military history although almost all texts have elements of both : descriptive history that serves to chronicle conflicts without offering any statements about the causes nature of conduct the ending and effects of a conflict and analytical history that seeks to offer statements about the causes nature ending and aftermath of conflicts – as a means of deriving knowledge and understanding of conflicts as a whole and prevent repetition of mistakes in future to suggest better concepts or methods in employing forces or to advocate the need for new technology,complex
,complex
despite the growing importance of military technology military activity depends above all on people,complex

the english word war derives from the late old english circa,complex
words wyrre and werre from old french werre also guerre as in modern french in turn from the frankish werra ultimately deriving from the proto-germanic werzō 'mixture confusion ',complex
the word is related to the old saxon werran old high german werran and the german verwirren meaning “ to confuse ” “ to perplex ” and “ to bring into confusion ”,complex
war must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other military technology and equipment by armed forces employing military tactics and operational art within a broad military strategy subject to military logistics,complex
studies of war by military theorists throughout military history have sought to identify the philosophy of war and to reduce it to a military science,complex
modern military science considers several factors before a national defence policy is created to allow a war to commence : the environment in the areas of combat operations the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in,complex
asymmetric warfare is a conflict between belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability and/or size,complex
biological warfare or germ warfare is the use of weaponized biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria viruses and fungi,complex
chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat,complex
poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during world war i and resulted in over a million estimated casualties including more than civilians,complex
civil war is a war between forces belonging to the same nation or political entity,complex
conventional warfare is declared war between states in which nuclear biological or chemical weapons are not used or see limited deployment,complex
cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation 's information systems,complex
insurgency is a rebellion against authority when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents lawful combatants,complex
an insurgency can be fought via counter-insurgency warfare and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents ' claims against the incumbent regime,complex
information warfare is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems against the computers and networks that support the four critical infrastructures the power grid communications financial and transportation,complex
nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the primary or a major method of achieving capitulation,complex
total war is warfare by any means possible disregarding the laws of war placing no limits on legitimate military targets using weapons and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties or demanding a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population,complex
unconventional warfare the opposite of conventional warfare is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence capitulation or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict,complex
war of aggression is a war for conquest or gain rather than self-defense this can be the basis of war crimes under customary international law,complex
war of liberation wars of national liberation or national liberation revolutions are conflicts fought by nations to gain independence,complex
the term is used in conjunction with wars against foreign powers or at least those perceived as foreign to establish separate sovereign states for the rebelling nationality,complex
from a different point of view these wars are called insurgencies rebellions or wars of independence,complex
the earliest recorded evidence of war belongs to the mesolithic cemetery site which has been determined to be approximately years old,complex
about forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death,complex
since the rise of the state some years ago military activity has occurred over much of the globe,complex
the advent of gunpowder and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare,complex
according to conway w,complex
henderson one source claims that wars have taken place between bc and the late th century costing,complex
billion lives leaving only years of peace beer :,complex
an unfavorable review of this estimate mentions the following regarding one of the proponents of this estimate : in addition perhaps feeling that the war casualties figure was improbably high he changed approximately human beings have been killed by war or the diseases produced by war to approximately human beings,complex
c,complex
the lower figure is more plausible but could also be on the high side considering that the deadliest acts of mass violence between bce and ce wars and other man-made disasters with at least and up to million victims claimed about million human lives in total,complex
primitive warfare is estimated to have accounted for,complex
of deaths and claimed million victims,complex
added to the aforementioned and perhaps too high figure of million between bc and the late th century this would mean a total of people killed by war including deaths from famine and disease caused by war throughout the history and pre-history of mankind,complex

nuclear warfare breaking out in august when nuclear arsenals were at peak level and the aftermath thereof could have reduced human population from by to within a period of about one year according to a projection that did not consider the most severe predictions concerning nuclear winter,complex

the major writing systems—methods of inscription—broadly fall into five categories : logographic syllabic alphabetic featural and ideographic symbols for ideas,complex
a sixth category pictographic is insufficient to represent language on its own but often forms the core of logographies,complex
a logogram is a written character which represents a word or morpheme,complex
a vast number of logograms are needed to write chinese characters cuneiform and mayan where a glyph may stand for a morpheme a syllable or both—logoconsonantal in the case of hieroglyphs,complex
many logograms have an ideographic component chinese radicals hieroglyphic determiners,complex
for example in mayan the glyph for fin pronounced ka was also used to represent the syllable ka whenever the pronunciation of a logogram needed to be indicated or when there was no logogram,complex
in chinese about of characters are compounds of a semantic meaning element called a radical with an existing character to indicate the pronunciation called a phonetic,complex
however such phonetic elements complement the logographic elements rather than vice versa,complex
the main logographic system in use today is chinese characters used with some modification for the various languages or dialects of china japan and sometimes in korean despite the fact that in south and north korea the phonetic hangul system is mainly used,complex
a syllabary is a set of written symbols that represent or approximate syllables,complex
a glyph in a syllabary typically represents a consonant followed by a vowel or just a vowel alone though in some scripts more complex syllables such as consonant-vowel-consonant or consonant-consonant-vowel may have dedicated glyphs,complex
phonetically related syllables are not so indicated in the script,complex
for instance the syllable ka may look nothing like the syllable ki nor will syllables with the same vowels be similar,complex
syllabaries are best suited to languages with a relatively simple syllable structure such as japanese,complex
other languages that use syllabic writing include the linear b script for mycenaean greek cherokee ndjuka an english-based creole language of surinam and the vai script of liberia,complex
most logographic systems have a strong syllabic component,complex
ethiopic though technically an abugida has fused consonants and vowels together to the point where it is learned as if it were a syllabary,complex
an alphabet is a set of symbols each of which represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language,complex
in a perfectly phonological alphabet the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions : a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling,complex
as languages often evolve independently of their writing systems and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language,complex
in most of the writing systems of the middle east it is usually only the consonants of a word that are written although vowels may be indicated by the addition of various diacritical marks,complex
writing systems based primarily on marking the consonant phonemes alone date back to the hieroglyphs of ancient egypt,complex
such systems are called abjads derived from the arabic word for alphabet,complex
in most of the alphabets of india and southeast asia vowels are indicated through diacritics or modification of the shape of the consonant,complex
these are called abugidas,complex
some abugidas such as ethiopic and cree are learned by children as syllabaries and so are often called syllabics,complex
however unlike true syllabaries there is not an independent glyph for each syllable,complex
sometimes the term alphabet is restricted to systems with separate letters for consonants and vowels such as the latin alphabet although abugidas and abjads may also be accepted as alphabets,complex
because of this use greek is often considered to be the first alphabet,complex
a featural script notates the building blocks of the phonemes that make up a language,complex
for instance all sounds pronounced with the lips labial sounds may have some element in common,complex
in the latin alphabet this is accidentally the case with the letters b and p however labial m is completely dissimilar and the similar-looking q and d are not labial,complex
in korean hangul however all four labial consonants are based on the same basic element but in practice korean is learned by children as an ordinary alphabet and the featural elements tend to pass unnoticed,complex
another featural script is signwriting the most popular writing system for many sign languages where the shapes and movements of the hands and face are represented iconically,complex
featural scripts are also common in fictional or invented systems such as j,complex

historians draw a sharp distinction between prehistory and history with history defined by the advent of writing,complex
the cave paintings and petroglyphs of prehistoric peoples can be considered precursors of writing but they are not considered true writing because they did not represent language directly,complex
writing systems develop and change based on the needs of the people who use them,complex
sometimes the shape orientation and meaning of individual signs changes over time,complex
by tracing the development of a script it is possible to learn about the needs of the people who used the script as well as how the script changed over time,complex
the many tools and writing materials used throughout history include stone tablets clay tablets bamboo slats papyrus wax tablets vellum parchment paper copperplate styluses quills ink brushes pencils pens and many styles of lithography,complex
the incas used knotted cords known as quipu or khipu for keeping records,complex
the typewriter and various forms of word processors have subsequently become widespread writing tools and various studies have compared the ways in which writers have framed the experience of writing with such tools as compared with the pen or pencil,complex
,complex
by definition the modern practice of history begins with written records,complex
evidence of human culture without writing is the realm of prehistory,complex
the dispilio tablet greece jiahu symbols china and tărtăria tablets romania which have been carbon dated to the th millennium bc are recent discoveries of the earliest known neolithic writings,complex
while neolithic writing is a current research topic conventional history assumes that the writing process first evolved from economic necessity in the ancient near east,complex
writing most likely began as a consequence of political expansion in ancient cultures which needed reliable means for transmitting information maintaining financial accounts keeping historical records and similar activities,complex
around the th millennium bc the complexity of trade and administration outgrew the power of memory and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form,complex
archaeologist denise schmandt-besserat determined the link between previously uncategorized clay tokens the oldest of which have been found in the zagros region of iran and the first known writing mesopotamian cuneiform,complex
in approximately bc the mesopotamians began using clay tokens to count their agricultural and manufactured goods,complex
later they began placing these tokens inside large hollow clay containers bulla or globular envelopes which were then sealed,complex
the quantity of tokens in each container came to be expressed by impressing on the container 's surface one picture for each instance of the token inside,complex
they next dispensed with the tokens relying solely on symbols for the tokens drawn on clay surfaces,complex
to avoid making a picture for each instance of the same object for example : pictures of a hat to represent hats they 'counted ' the objects by using various small marks,complex
in this way the sumerians added a system for enumerating objects to their incipient system of symbols,complex
the original mesopotamian writing system believed to be the world 's oldest was derived around bc from this method of keeping accounts,complex
by the end of the th millennium bc the mesopotamians were using a triangular-shaped stylus pressed into soft clay to record numbers,complex
this system was gradually augmented with using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted by means of pictographs,complex
round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus hence the term cuneiform at first only for logograms but by the th century bc also for phonetic elements,complex
around bc cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken sumerian,complex
about that time mesopotamian cuneiform became a general purpose writing system for logograms syllables and numbers,complex
this script was adapted to another mesopotamian language the east semitic akkadian assyrian and babylonian around bc and then to others such as elamite hattian hurrian and hittite,complex
scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for ugaritic and old persian,complex
with the adoption of aramaic as the 'lingua franca ' of the neo-assyrian empire – bc old aramaic was also adapted to mesopotamian cuneiform,complex
the last cuneiform scripts in akkadian discovered thus far date from the st century ad,complex
over the centuries three distinct elamite scripts developed,complex
proto-elamite is the oldest known writing system from iran,complex
in use only for a brief time c,complex
– bc clay tablets with proto-elamite writing have been found at different sites across iran,complex
the proto-elamite script is thought to have developed from early cuneiform proto-cuneiform,complex
the proto-elamite script consists of more than signs and is thought to be partly logographic,complex
linear elamite is a writing system attested in a few monumental inscriptions in iran,complex
it was used for a very brief period during the last quarter of the rd millennium bc,complex
it is often claimed that linear elamite is a syllabic writing system derived from proto-elamite although this can not be proven since linear-elamite has not been deciphered,complex
several scholars have attempted to decipher the script most notably walther hinz and piero meriggi,complex
the elamite cuneiform script was used from about to bc and was adapted from the akkadian cuneiform,complex
the elamite cuneiform script consisted of about symbols far fewer than most other cuneiform scripts,complex
cretan hieroglyphs are found on artifacts of crete early-to-mid-nd millennium bc mm i to mm iii overlapping with linear a from mm iia at the earliest,complex
linear b the writing system of the mycenaean greeks has been deciphered while linear a has yet to be deciphered,complex
the sequence and the geographical spread of the three overlapping but distinct writing systems can be summarized as follows : cretan hieroglyphs were used in crete from c,complex
to bc linear a was used in the aegean islands kea kythera melos thera and the greek mainland laconia from c,complex
th century to bc and linear b was used in crete knossos and mainland pylos mycenae thebes tiryns from c,complex
to bc,complex
the earliest surviving examples of writing in china—inscriptions on so-called oracle bones tortoise plastrons and ox scapulae used for divination—date from around bc in the late shang dynasty,complex
a small number of bronze inscriptions from the same period have also survived,complex
historians have found that the type of media used had an effect on what the writing was documenting and how it was used,complex
in archaeologists reported discoveries of isolated tortoise-shell carvings dating back to the th millennium bc but whether or not these symbols are related to the characters of the later oracle-bone script is disputed,complex
the earliest known hieroglyphic inscriptions are the narmer palette dating to c,complex
bc and several recent discoveries that may be slightly older though these glyphs were based on a much older artistic rather than written tradition,complex
the hieroglyphic script was logographic with phonetic adjuncts that included an effective alphabet,complex
writing was very important in maintaining the egyptian empire and literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of scribes,complex
only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes in the service of temple pharaonic and military authorities,complex
the hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn but in later centuries was purposely made even more so as this preserved the scribes ' status,complex
the world 's oldest known alphabet appears to have been developed by canaanite turquoise miners in the sinai desert around the mid-th century bc,complex
around crude inscriptions have been found at a mountainous egyptian mining site known as serabit el-khadem,complex
this site was also home to a temple of hathor the mistress of turquoise,complex
a later two line inscription has also been found at wadi el-hol in central egypt,complex
based on hieroglyphic prototypes but also including entirely new symbols each sign apparently stood for a consonant rather than a word : the basis of an alphabetic system,complex
it was not until the th to th centuries however that the alphabet took hold and became widely used,complex
indus script refers to short strings of symbols associated with the indus valley civilization which spanned modern-day pakistan and north india used between and bc,complex
in spite of many attempts at decipherments and claims it is as yet undeciphered,complex
the term 'indus script ' is mainly applied to that used in the mature harappan phase which perhaps evolved from a few signs found in early harappa after bc and was followed by the mature harappan script,complex
the script is written from right to left and sometimes follows a boustrophedonic style,complex
since the number of principal signs is about – midway between typical logographic and syllabic scripts many scholars accept the script to be logo-syllabic typically syllabic scripts have about – signs whereas logographic scripts have a very large number of principal signs,complex
several scholars maintain that structural analysis indicates that an agglutinative language underlies the script,complex
in archaeologists discovered that there was a civilization in central asia that used writing c,complex

an excavation near ashgabat the capital of turkmenistan revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that was used as a stamp seal,complex
the proto-sinaitic script in which proto-canaanite is believed to have been first written is attested as far back as the th century bc,complex
the phoenician writing system was adapted from the proto-canaanite script sometime before the th century bc which in turn borrowed principles of representing phonetic information from hieratic cuneiform and egyptian hieroglyphs,complex
this writing system was an odd sort of syllabary in which only consonants are represented,complex
this script was adapted by the greeks who adapted certain consonantal signs to represent their vowels,complex
the cumae alphabet a variant of the early greek alphabet gave rise to the etruscan alphabet and its own descendants such as the latin alphabet and runes,complex
other descendants from the greek alphabet include cyrillic used to write bulgarian russian and serbian among others,complex
the phoenician system was also adapted into the aramaic script from which the hebrew and the arabic scripts are descended,complex
the tifinagh script berber languages is descended from the libyco-berber script which is assumed to be of phoenician origin,complex
definitions of literature have varied over time : it is a culturally relative definition,complex
astronomy from the greek ἀστρονομία from ἄστρον astron star and -νομία -nomia from νόμος nomos law or culture means law of the stars or culture of the stars depending on the translation,complex
astronomy should not be confused with astrology the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects,complex
although the two fields share a common origin they are now entirely distinct,complex
generally both of the terms astronomy and astrophysics may be used to refer to the same subject,complex
based on strict dictionary definitions astronomy refers to the study of objects and matter outside the earth 's atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties while astrophysics refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with the behavior physical properties and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena,complex
in some cases as in the introduction of the introductory textbook the physical universe by frank shu astronomy may be used to describe the qualitative study of the subject whereas astrophysics is used to describe the physics-oriented version of the subject,complex
however since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related to physics modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics,complex
some fields such as astrometry are purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics,complex
various departments in which scientists carry out research on this subject may use astronomy and astrophysics partly depending on whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department and many professional astronomers have physics rather than astronomy degrees,complex
some titles of the leading scientific journals in this field include the astronomical journal the astrophysical journal and astronomy and astrophysics,complex
,complex
in early historic times astronomy only consisted of the observation and predictions of the motions of objects visible to the naked eye,complex
in some locations early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose,complex
in addition to their ceremonial uses these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons an important factor in knowing when to plant crops and in understanding the length of the year,complex
before tools such as the telescope were invented early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye,complex
as civilizations developed most notably in mesopotamia greece persia india china egypt and central america astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the universe began to develop,complex
most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets a science now referred to as astrometry,complex
from these observations early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed and the nature of the sun moon and the earth in the universe were explored philosophically,complex
the earth was believed to be the center of the universe with the sun the moon and the stars rotating around it,complex
this is known as the geocentric model of the universe or the ptolemaic system named after ptolemy,complex
a particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy which began among the babylonians who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations,complex
the babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in a repeating cycle known as a saros,complex
following the babylonians significant advances in astronomy were made in ancient greece and the hellenistic world,complex
greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational physical explanation for celestial phenomena,complex
in the rd century bc aristarchus of samos estimated the size and distance of the moon and sun and he proposed a model of the solar system where the earth and planets rotated around the sun now called the heliocentric model,complex
in the nd century bc hipparchus discovered precession calculated the size and distance of the moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe,complex
hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of stars and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from greek astronomy,complex
the antikythera mechanism c,complex
– bc was an early analog computer designed to calculate the location of the sun moon and planets for a given date,complex
technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the th century when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in europe,complex
during the middle ages astronomy was mostly stagnant in medieval europe at least until the th century,complex
however astronomy flourished in the islamic world and other parts of the world,complex
this led to the emergence of the first astronomical observatories in the muslim world by the early th century,complex
in the andromeda galaxy the largest galaxy in the local group was described by the persian astronomer azophi in his book of fixed stars,complex
the sn supernova the brightest apparent magnitude stellar event in recorded history was observed by the egyptian arabic astronomer ali ibn ridwan and chinese astronomers in,complex
some of the prominent islamic mostly persian and arab astronomers who made significant contributions to the science include al-battani thebit azophi albumasar biruni arzachel al-birjandi and the astronomers of the maragheh and samarkand observatories,complex
astronomers during that time introduced many arabic names now used for individual stars,complex
it is also believed that the ruins at great zimbabwe and timbuktu may have housed astronomical observatories,complex
europeans had previously believed that there had been no astronomical observation in sub-saharan africa during the pre-colonial middle ages but modern discoveries show otherwise,complex
for over six centuries from the recovery of ancient learning during the late middle ages into the enlightenment the roman catholic church gave more financial and social support to the study of astronomy than probably all other institutions,complex
among the church 's motives was finding the date for easter,complex
during the renaissance nicolaus copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the solar system,complex
his work was defended by galileo galilei and expanded upon by johannes kepler,complex
kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the sun,complex
however kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down,complex
it was isaac newton with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation who finally explained the motions of the planets,complex
newton also developed the reflecting telescope,complex
improvements in the size and quality of the telescope led to further discoveries,complex
the english astronomer john flamsteed catalogued over stars more extensive star catalogues were produced by nicolas louis de lacaille,complex
the astronomer william herschel made a detailed catalog of nebulosity and clusters and in discovered the planet uranus the first new planet found,complex
the distance to a star was announced in when the parallax of cygni was measured by friedrich bessel,complex
during the –th centuries the study of the three-body problem by leonhard euler alexis claude clairaut and jean le rond d'alembert led to more accurate predictions about the motions of the moon and planets,complex
this work was further refined by joseph louis lagrange and pierre simon laplace allowing the masses of the planets and moons to be estimated from their perturbations,complex
significant advances in astronomy came about with the introduction of new technology including the spectroscope and photography,complex
joseph von fraunhofer discovered about bands in the spectrum of the sun in – which in gustav kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements,complex
stars were proven to be similar to the earth 's own sun but with a wide range of temperatures masses and sizes,complex
the existence of the earth 's galaxy the milky way as its own group of stars was only proved in the th century along with the existence of external galaxies,complex
the observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the universe,complex
theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as black holes and neutron stars which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as quasars pulsars blazars and radio galaxies,complex
physical cosmology made huge advances during the th century,complex
in the early s the model of the big bang theory was formulated heavily evidenced by cosmic microwave background radiation hubble 's law and the cosmological abundances of elements,complex
space telescopes have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere,complex
in february it was revealed that the ligo project had detected evidence of gravitational waves in the previous september,complex
our main source of information about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light or more generally electromagnetic radiation,complex
observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the electromagnetic spectrum on which the observations are made,complex
some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the earth 's surface while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the earth 's atmosphere,complex
specific information on these subfields is given below,complex
radio astronomy uses radiation with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter outside the visible range,complex
radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons,complex
hence it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths,complex
although some radio waves are emitted directly by astronomical objects a product of thermal emission most of the radio emission that is observed is the result of synchrotron radiation which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields,complex
additionally a number of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas notably the hydrogen spectral line at cm are observable at radio wavelengths,complex
a wide variety of other objects are observable at radio wavelengths including supernovae interstellar gas pulsars and active galactic nuclei,complex
infrared astronomy is founded on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision,complex
the infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light such as planets circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust,complex
the longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies,complex
observations from the wide-field infrared survey explorer wise have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous galactic protostars and their host star clusters,complex
with the exception of infrared wavelengths close to visible light such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere or masked as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission,complex
consequently infrared observatories have to be located in high dry places on earth or in space,complex
some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared,complex
this allows the study of the chemistry of space more specifically it can detect water in comets,complex
historically optical astronomy also called visible light astronomy is the oldest form of astronomy,complex
images of observations were originally drawn by hand,complex
in the late th century and most of the th century images were made using photographic equipment,complex
modern images are made using digital detectors particularly using charge-coupled devices ccds and recorded on modern medium,complex
although visible light itself extends from approximately å to å nm to nm that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation,complex
ultraviolet astronomy employs ultraviolet wavelengths between approximately and å to nm,complex
light at those wavelengths is absorbed by the earth 's atmosphere requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space,complex
ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars ob stars that are very bright in this wave band,complex
this includes the blue stars in other galaxies which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys,complex
other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae supernova remnants and active galactic nuclei,complex
however as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary,complex
x-ray astronomy uses x-ray wavelengths,complex
typically x-ray radiation is produced by synchrotron emission the result of electrons orbiting magnetic field lines thermal emission from thin gases above million kelvins and thermal emission from thick gases above kelvin,complex
since x-rays are absorbed by the earth 's atmosphere all x-ray observations must be performed from high-altitude balloons rockets or x-ray astronomy satellites,complex
notable x-ray sources include x-ray binaries pulsars supernova remnants elliptical galaxies clusters of galaxies and active galactic nuclei,complex
gamma ray astronomy observes astronomical objects at the shortest wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum,complex
gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the compton gamma ray observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric cherenkov telescopes,complex
the cherenkov telescopes do not detect the gamma rays directly but instead detect the flashes of visible light produced when gamma rays are absorbed by the earth 's atmosphere,complex
most gamma-ray emitting sources are actually gamma-ray bursts objects which only produce gamma radiation for a few milliseconds to thousands of seconds before fading away,complex
only of gamma-ray sources are non-transient sources,complex
these steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars neutron stars and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei,complex
in addition to electromagnetic radiation a few other events originating from great distances may be observed from the earth,complex
in neutrino astronomy astronomers use heavily shielded underground facilities such as sage gallex and kamioka ii/iii for the detection of neutrinos,complex
the vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the earth originate from the sun but neutrinos were also detected from supernova a,complex
cosmic rays which consist of very high energy particles atomic nuclei that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the earth 's atmosphere result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories,complex
some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the earth 's atmosphere,complex
gravitational-wave astronomy is an emerging field of astronomy that employs gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects,complex
a few observatories have been constructed such as the laser interferometer gravitational observatory ligo,complex
ligo made its first detection on september observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole,complex
a second gravitational wave was detected on december and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments,complex
the combination of observations made using electromagnetic radiation neutrinos or gravitational waves and other complementary information is known as multi-messenger astronomy,complex
one of the oldest fields in astronomy and in all of science is the measurement of the positions of celestial objects,complex
historically accurate knowledge of the positions of the sun moon planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation the use of celestial objects to guide navigation and in the making of calendars,complex
careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy a field known as celestial mechanics,complex
more recently the tracking of near-earth objects will allow for predictions of close encounters or potential collisions of the earth with those objects,complex
the measurement of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder that is used to measure the scale of the universe,complex
parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars as their properties can be compared,complex
measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the milky way galaxy,complex
astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter in the galaxy,complex
during the s the measurement of the stellar wobble of nearby stars was used to detect large extrasolar planets orbiting those stars,complex
the origin of the word galaxy derives from the greek term for the milky way galaxias γαλαξίας milky one or kyklos galaktikos milky circle due to its appearance as a milky band of light in the sky,complex
in greek mythology zeus places his son born by a mortal woman the infant heracles on hera 's breast while she is asleep so that the baby will drink her divine milk and will thus become immortal,complex
hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realizes she is nursing an unknown baby : she pushes the baby away some of her milk spills and it produces the faint band of light known as the milky way,complex
in the astronomical literature the capitalized word galaxy is often used to refer to our galaxy the milky way to distinguish it from the other galaxies in our universe,complex
the english term milky way can be traced back to a story by chaucer c,complex
: see yonder lo the galaxyë which men clepeth the milky wey for hit is whyt,complex
galaxies were initially discovered telescopically and were known as spiral nebulae,complex
most th to th century astronomers considered them as either unresolved star clusters or anagalactic nebulae and were just thought as a part of the milky way but their true composition and natures remained a mystery,complex
observations using larger telescopes of a few nearby bright galaxies like the andromeda galaxy began resolving them into huge conglomerations of stars but based simply on the apparent faintness and sheer population of stars the true distances of these objects placed them well beyond the milky way,complex
for this reason they were popularly called island universes but this term quickly fell into disuse as the word universe implied the entirety of existence,complex
instead they became known simply as galaxies,complex
tens of thousands of galaxies have been catalogued but only a few have well-established names such as the andromeda galaxy the magellanic clouds the whirlpool galaxy and the sombrero galaxy,complex
astronomers work with numbers from certain catalogues such as the messier catalogue the ngc new general catalogue the ic index catalogue the cgcg catalogue of galaxies and of clusters of galaxies the mcg morphological catalogue of galaxies and ugc uppsala general catalogue of galaxies,complex
all of the well-known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogues but each time under a different number,complex
for example messier is a spiral galaxy having the number in the catalogue of messier but also codes ngc ugc cgcg - mcg -- and pgc,complex
the realization that we live in a galaxy which is one among many galaxies parallels major discoveries that were made about the milky way and other nebulae,complex
the greek philosopher democritus – bce proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as the milky way might consist of distant stars,complex
aristotle – bce however believed the milky way to be caused by the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large numerous and close together and that the ignition takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere in the region of the world that is continuous with the heavenly motions,complex
the neoplatonist philosopher olympiodorus the younger c,complex
– ce was critical of this view arguing that if the milky way is sublunary situated between earth and the moon it should appear different at different times and places on earth and that it should have parallax which it does not,complex
in his view the milky way is celestial,complex
according to mohani mohamed the arabian astronomer alhazen – made the first attempt at observing and measuring the milky way 's parallax and he thus determined that because the milky way had no parallax it must be remote from the earth not belonging to the atmosphere,complex
the persian astronomer al-bīrūnī – proposed the milky way galaxy to be a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars,complex
the andalusian astronomer ibn bâjjah avempace d,complex
proposed that the milky way is made up of many stars that almost touch one another and appear to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material citing his observation of the conjunction of jupiter and mars as evidence of this occurring when two objects are near,complex
in the th century the syrian-born ibn qayyim proposed the milky way galaxy to be a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars,complex
actual proof of the milky way consisting of many stars came in when the italian astronomer galileo galilei used a telescope to study the milky way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint stars,complex
in the english astronomer thomas wright in his an original theory or new hypothesis of the universe speculated correctly that the galaxy might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars held together by gravitational forces akin to the solar system but on a much larger scale,complex
the resulting disk of stars can be seen as a band on the sky from our perspective inside the disk,complex
in a treatise in immanuel kant elaborated on wright 's idea about the structure of the milky way,complex
the first project to describe the shape of the milky way and the position of the sun was undertaken by william herschel in by counting the number of stars in different regions of the sky,complex
he produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the solar system close to the center,complex
using a refined approach kapteyn in arrived at the picture of a small diameter about kiloparsecs ellipsoid galaxy with the sun close to the center,complex
a different method by harlow shapley based on the cataloguing of globular clusters led to a radically different picture : a flat disk with diameter approximately kiloparsecs and the sun far from the center,complex
both analyses failed to take into account the absorption of light by interstellar dust present in the galactic plane but after robert julius trumpler quantified this effect in by studying open clusters the present picture of our host galaxy the milky way emerged,complex
a few galaxies outside the milky way are visible on a dark night to the unaided eye including the andromeda galaxy large magellanic cloud and the small magellanic cloud,complex
in the th century the persian astronomer al-sufi made the earliest recorded identification of the andromeda galaxy describing it as a small cloud,complex
in al-sufi probably mentioned the large magellanic cloud in his book of fixed stars referring to al bakr of the southern arabs since at a declination of about ° south it was not visible where he lived it was not well known to europeans until magellan 's voyage in the th century,complex
the andromeda galaxy was later independently noted by simon marius in,complex
in philosopher emanuel swedenborg in his principia speculated that there may be galaxies outside our own that are formed into galactic clusters that are miniscule parts of the universe which extends far beyond what we can see,complex
these views are remarkably close to the present-day views of the cosmos,complex
in thomas wright speculated correctly that the milky way is a flattened disk of stars and that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate milky ways,complex
in immanuel kant used the term island universe to describe these distant nebulae,complex
toward the end of the th century charles messier compiled a catalog containing the brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance,complex
the usual english proper name for earth 's natural satellite is the moon which in nonscientific texts is usually not capitalized,complex
the noun moon is derived from old english mōna which like all germanic language cognates stems from proto-germanic mēnô which comes from proto-indo-european mḗh₁n̥s moon month which comes from the proto-indo-european root meh₁- to measure the month being the ancient unit of time measured by the moon,complex
occasionally the name luna is used,complex
in literature especially science fiction luna is used to distinguish it from other moons while in poetry the name has been used to denote personification of our moon,complex
the modern english adjective pertaining to the moon is lunar derived from the latin word for the moon luna,complex
the adjective selenic usually only used to refer to the chemical element selenium is so rarely used to refer to the moon that this meaning is not recorded in most major dictionaries,complex
it is derived from the ancient greek word for the moon σελήνη selḗnē from which is however also derived the prefix seleno- as in selenography the study of the physical features of the moon as well as the element name selenium,complex
both the greek goddess selene and the roman goddess diana were alternatively called cynthia,complex
the names luna cynthia and selene are reflected in terminology for lunar orbits in words such as apolune pericynthion and selenocentric,complex
the name diana comes from the proto-indo-european diw-yo heavenly which comes from the pie root dyeu- to shine which in many derivatives means sky heaven and god and is also the origin of latin dies day,complex
the moon formed,complex
billion years ago some million years after the origin of the solar system,complex
several forming mechanisms have been proposed including the fission of the moon from earth 's crust through centrifugal force which would require too great an initial spin of earth the gravitational capture of a pre-formed moon which would require an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of earth to dissipate the energy of the passing moon and the co-formation of earth and the moon together in the primordial accretion disk which does not explain the depletion of metals in the moon,complex
these hypotheses also can not account for the high angular momentum of the earth–moon system,complex
the prevailing hypothesis is that the earth–moon system formed after an impact of a mars-sized body named theia with the proto-earth giant impact,complex
the impact blasted material into earth 's orbit and then the material accreted and formed the moon,complex
the moon 's far side has a crust that is mi km thicker than that of the near side,complex
this is thought to be because the moon fused from two different bodies,complex
this hypothesis although not perfect perhaps best explains the evidence,complex
eighteen months prior to an october conference on lunar origins bill hartmann roger phillips and jeff taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists : you have eighteen months,complex
go back to your apollo data go back to your computer do whatever you have to but make up your mind,complex
do n't come to our conference unless you have something to say about the moon 's birth,complex
at the conference at kona hawaii the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular,complex
before the conference there were partisans of the three traditional theories plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn ’ t think the debate would ever be resolved,complex
afterward there were essentially only two groups : the giant impact camp and the agnostics,complex
giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early solar system,complex
computer simulations of giant impacts have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the angular momentum of the earth–moon system,complex
these simulations also show that most of the moon derived from the impactor rather than the proto-earth,complex
however more recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the moon derived from the proto-earth,complex
other bodies of the inner solar system such as mars and vesta have according to meteorites from them very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions compared to earth,complex
however earth and the moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions,complex
the isotopic equalization of the earth-moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two although this is debated,complex
the impact released a lot of energy and then the released material re-accreted into the earth–moon system,complex
this would have melted the outer shell of earth and thus formed a magma ocean,complex
similarly the newly formed moon would also have been affected and had its own lunar magma ocean its depth is estimated from about km miles to km miles,complex
while the giant impact hypothesis might explain many lines of evidence some questions are still unresolved most of which involve the moon 's composition,complex
in a team at the carnegie institute of washington reported the most precise measurement of the isotopic signatures of lunar rocks,complex
to their surprise the rocks from the apollo program had the same isotopic signature as rocks from earth however they differed from almost all other bodies in the solar system,complex
indeed this observation was unexpected because most of the material that formed the moon was thought to come from theia and it was announced in that there was less than a chance that theia and earth had identical isotopic signatures,complex
other apollo lunar samples had in the same titanium isotopes composition as earth which conflicts with what is expected if the moon formed far from earth or is derived from theia,complex
these discrepancies may be explained by variations of the giant impact hypothesis,complex
,complex
the moon is a differentiated body : it has a geochemically distinct crust mantle and core,complex
the moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as km mi and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly km mi,complex
around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about km mi,complex
this structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the moon 's formation,complex
billion years ago,complex
crystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallised lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop,complex
the final liquids to crystallise would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements,complex
consistent with this perspective geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests the crust of mostly anorthosite,complex
the moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition which is more iron-rich than that of earth,complex
the crust is on average about km mi thick,complex
the moon is the second-densest satellite in the solar system after io,complex
however the inner core of the moon is small with a radius of about km mi or less around of the radius of the moon,complex
its composition is not well defined but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel analyses of the moon 's time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten,complex
the topography of the moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis,complex
its most visible topographic feature is the giant far-side south pole–aitken basin some km mi in diameter the largest crater on the moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the solar system,complex
at km,complex
mi deep its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the moon,complex
the highest elevations of the moon 's surface are located directly to the northeast and it has been suggested might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the south pole–aitken basin,complex
the idea of planets has evolved over its history from the divine lights of antiquity to the earthly objects of the scientific age,complex
the concept has expanded to include worlds not only in the solar system but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems,complex
the ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy,complex
the five classical planets being visible to the naked eye have been known since ancient times and have had a significant impact on mythology religious cosmology and ancient astronomy,complex
in ancient times astronomers noted how certain lights moved across the sky as opposed to the fixed stars which maintained a constant relative position in the sky,complex
ancient greeks called these lights πλάνητες ἀστέρες planētes asteres wandering stars or simply πλανῆται planētai wanderers from which today 's word planet was derived,complex
in ancient greece china babylon and indeed all pre-modern civilizations it was almost universally believed that earth was the center of the universe and that all the planets circled earth,complex
the reasons for this perception were that stars and planets appeared to revolve around earth each day and the apparently common-sense perceptions that earth was solid and stable and that it was not moving but at rest,complex
the first civilization known to have a functional theory of the planets were the babylonians who lived in mesopotamia in the first and second millennia bc,complex
the oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the babylonian venus tablet of ammisaduqa a th-century bc copy of a list of observations of the motions of the planet venus that probably dates as early as the second millennium bc,complex
the mul,complex
apin is a pair of cuneiform tablets dating from the th century bc that lays out the motions of the sun moon and planets over the course of the year,complex
the babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become western astrology,complex
the enuma anu enlil written during the neo-assyrian period in the th century bc comprises a list of omens and their relationships with various celestial phenomena including the motions of the planets,complex
venus mercury and the outer planets mars jupiter and saturn were all identified by babylonian astronomers,complex
these would remain the only known planets until the invention of the telescope in early modern times,complex
the term biology is derived from the greek word βίος bios life and the suffix -λογία -logia study of,complex
dna is a long polymer made from repeating units called nucleotides,complex
the structure of dna is dynamic along its length being capable of coiling into tight loops and other shapes,complex
in all species it is composed of two helical chains bound to each other by hydrogen bonds,complex
both chains are coiled around the same axis and have the same pitch of ångströms,complex
nanometres,complex
the pair of chains has a radius of ångströms,complex
nanometre,complex
according to another study when measured in a different solution the dna chain measured to ångströms wide,complex
to,complex
nanometres and one nucleotide unit measured,complex
å,complex
nm long,complex
although each individual nucleotide repeating unit is very small dna polymers can be very large molecules containing hundreds of millions of nucleotides,complex
for instance the dna in the largest human chromosome chromosome number consists of approximately million base pairs and would be mm long if straightened,complex
in living organisms dna does not usually exist as a single strand but instead as a pair of strands that are held tightly together,complex
these two long strands entwine like vines in the shape of a double helix,complex
the nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule which holds the chain together and a nucleobase which interacts with the other dna strand in the helix,complex
a nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide,complex
a polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides as in dna is called a polynucleotide,complex
the backbone of the dna strand is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues,complex
the sugar in dna is -deoxyribose which is a pentose five-carbon sugar,complex
the sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings which are known as the ′ and ′ carbons the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a glycosidic bond,complex
when imagining dna each phosphoryl is normally considered to belong to the nucleotide whose ′ carbon forms a bond therewith,complex
any dna strand therefore normally has one end at which there is a phosphoryl attached to the ′ carbon of a ribose the ′ phosphoryl and another end at which there is a free hydroxyl attached to the ′ carbon of a ribose the ′ hydroxyl,complex
the orientation of the ′ and ′ carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers directionality sometimes called polarity to each dna strand,complex
in a double helix the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand : the strands are antiparallel,complex
the asymmetric ends of dna strands are said to have a directionality of five prime ′ and three prime ′ with the ′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the ′ end a terminal hydroxyl group,complex
one major difference between dna and rna is the sugar with the -deoxyribose in dna being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in rna,complex
the dna double helix is stabilized primarily by two forces : hydrogen bonds between nucleotides and base-stacking interactions among aromatic nucleobases,complex
in the aqueous environment of the cell the conjugated π bonds of nucleotide bases align perpendicular to the axis of the dna molecule minimizing their interaction with the solvation shell,complex
the four bases found in dna are adenine a cytosine c guanine g and thymine t,complex
these four bases are attached to the sugar-phosphate to form the complete nucleotide as shown for adenosine monophosphate,complex
adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine forming a-t and g-c base pairs,complex
the nucleobases are classified into two types : the purines a and g which are fused five- and six-membered heterocyclic compounds and the pyrimidines the six-membered rings c and t,complex
a fifth pyrimidine nucleobase uracil u usually takes the place of thymine in rna and differs from thymine by lacking a methyl group on its ring,complex
in addition to rna and dna many artificial nucleic acid analogues have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids or for use in biotechnology,complex
uracil is not usually found in dna occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine,complex
however in several bacteriophages such as bacillus subtilis bacteriophages pbs and pbs and yersinia bacteriophage pir- thymine has been replaced by uracil,complex
another phage - staphylococcal phage s - has been identified with a genome where thymine has been replaced by uracil,complex
uracil is also found in the dna of plasmodium falciparum it is present is relatively small amounts - uracil residues per million bases,complex
-hydroxymethyldeoxyuridinehmdu is also known to replace thymidine in several genomes including the bacillus phages spo ϕe sp h c and sp,complex
another modified uracil - -dihydroxypentauracil – has also been described,complex
base j beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil a modified form of uracil is also found in several organisms : the flagellates diplonema and euglena and all the kinetoplastid genera,complex
biosynthesis of j occurs in two steps : in the first step a specific thymidine in dna is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine in the second homedu is glycosylated to form j,complex
proteins that bind specifically to this base have been identified,complex
these proteins appear to be distant relatives of the tet oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia,complex
j appears to act as a termination signal for rna polymerase ii,complex
in the s-la bacteriophage which infects species of the genus synechocystis was found to have all the adenosine bases within its genome replaced by -diaminopurine,complex
in deoxyarchaeosine was found to be present in the genomes of several bacteria and the escherichia phage g,complex
modified bases also occur in dna,complex
the first of these recognised was -methylcytosine which was found in the genome of mycobacterium tuberculosis in,complex
the complete replacement of cytosine by -glycosylhydroxymethylcytosine in t even phages t t and t was observed in in the genomes of xanthomonas oryzae bacteriophage xp and halovirus fh the full complement of cystosine has been replaced by -methylcytosine,complex
n-methyadenine was discovered to be present in dna in,complex
n-carbamoyl-methyladenine was described in,complex
-methylguanine was described in,complex
n-methylcytosine in dna was described in,complex
in -hydroxycytosine was found in the genomes of the rhizobium phages rlji and n,complex
α-putrescinylthymine occurs in both the genomes of the delftia phage φw- and the bacillus phage sp,complex
α-glutamylthymidine is found in the bacillus phage sp and -dihydroxypentyluracil is found in the bacillus phage sp,complex
the reason for the presence of these non canonical bases in dna is not known,complex
it seems likely that at least part of the reason for their presence in bacterial viruses phages is to avoid the restriction enzymes present in bacteria,complex
this enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses,complex
this does not appear to be the entire story,complex
four modifications to the cytosine residues in human dna have been reported,complex
these modifications are the addition of methyl ch- hydroxymethyl choh- formyl cho- and carboxyl cooh- groups,complex
these modifications are thought to have regulatory functions,complex
uracil is found in the centromeric regions of at least two human chromosomes and,complex
seventeen non canonical bases are known to occur in dna,complex
most of the structures that make up animals plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule : amino acids carbohydrates and lipids often called fats,complex
the proposal that one type of organism could descend from another type goes back to some of the first pre-socratic greek philosophers such as anaximander and empedocles,complex
such proposals survived into roman times,complex
the poet and philosopher lucretius followed empedocles in his masterwork de rerum natura on the nature of things,complex
in contrast to these materialistic views aristotelianism considered all natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities known as forms,complex
this was part of a medieval teleological understanding of nature in which all things have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order,complex
variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the middle ages and were integrated into christian learning but aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be,complex
in the th century the new method of modern science rejected the aristotelian approach,complex
it sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of physical laws that were the same for all visible things and that did not require the existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order,complex
however this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types,complex
john ray applied one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types species to plant and animal types but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated themselves generation after generation,complex
the biological classification introduced by carl linnaeus in explicitly recognised the hierarchical nature of species relationships but still viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan,complex
other naturalists of this time speculated on the evolutionary change of species over time according to natural laws,complex
in pierre louis maupertuis wrote of natural modifications occurring during reproduction and accumulating over many generations to produce new species,complex
georges-louis leclerc comte de buffon suggested that species could degenerate into different organisms and erasmus darwin proposed that all warm-blooded animals could have descended from a single microorganism or filament,complex
the first full-fledged evolutionary scheme was jean-baptiste lamarck 's transmutation theory of which envisaged spontaneous generation continually producing simple forms of life that developed greater complexity in parallel lineages with an inherent progressive tendency and postulated that on a local level these lineages adapted to the environment by inheriting changes caused by their use or disuse in parents,complex
the latter process was later called lamarckism,complex
these ideas were condemned by established naturalists as speculation lacking empirical support,complex
in particular georges cuvier insisted that species were unrelated and fixed their similarities reflecting divine design for functional needs,complex
in the meantime ray 's ideas of benevolent design had been developed by william paley into the natural theology or evidences of the existence and attributes of the deity which proposed complex adaptations as evidence of divine design and which was admired by charles darwin,complex
the crucial break from the concept of constant typological classes or types in biology came with the theory of evolution through natural selection which was formulated by charles darwin in terms of variable populations,complex
partly influenced by an essay on the principle of population by thomas robert malthus darwin noted that population growth would lead to a struggle for existence in which favourable variations prevailed as others perished,complex
in each generation many offspring fail to survive to an age of reproduction because of limited resources,complex
this could explain the diversity of plants and animals from a common ancestry through the working of natural laws in the same way for all types of organism,complex
darwin developed his theory of natural selection from onwards and was writing up his big book on the subject when alfred russel wallace sent him a version of virtually the same theory in,complex
their separate papers were presented together at an meeting of the linnean society of london,complex
at the end of darwin 's publication of his abstract as on the origin of species explained natural selection in detail and in a way that led to an increasingly wide acceptance of darwin 's concepts of evolution at the expense of alternative theories,complex
thomas henry huxley applied darwin 's ideas to humans using paleontology and comparative anatomy to provide strong evidence that humans and apes shared a common ancestry,complex
some were disturbed by this since it implied that humans did not have a special place in the universe,complex
the mechanisms of reproductive heritability and the origin of new traits remained a mystery,complex
towards this end darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis,complex
in gregor mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements later known as genes,complex
mendel 's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of darwin 's pangenesis theory,complex
august weismann made the important distinction between germ cells that give rise to gametes such as sperm and egg cells and the somatic cells of the body demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only,complex
hugo de vries connected darwin 's pangenesis theory to weismann 's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that darwin 's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cell 's structure,complex
de vries was also one of the researchers who made mendel 's work well known believing that mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline,complex
to explain how new variants originate de vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de vries,complex
in the s pioneers in the field of population genetics such as ronald fisher sewall wright and j,complex
b,complex
s,complex
haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy,complex
the false contradiction between darwin 's theory genetic mutations and mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled,complex
in the s and s the so-called modern synthesis connected natural selection and population genetics based on mendelian inheritance into a unified theory that applied generally to any branch of biology,complex
the modern synthesis explained patterns observed across species in populations through fossil transitions in palaeontology and complex cellular mechanisms in developmental biology,complex
the publication of the structure of dna by james watson and francis crick with contribution of rosalind franklin in demonstrated a physical mechanism for inheritance,complex
molecular biology improved understanding of the relationship between genotype and phenotype,complex
advancements were also made in phylogenetic systematics mapping the transition of traits into a comparative and testable framework through the publication and use of evolutionary trees,complex
in evolutionary biologist theodosius dobzhansky penned that nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution because it has brought to light the relations of what first seemed disjointed facts in natural history into a coherent explanatory body of knowledge that describes and predicts many observable facts about life on this planet,complex
since then the modern synthesis has been further extended to explain biological phenomena across the full and integrative scale of the biological hierarchy from genes to species,complex
one extension known as evolutionary developmental biology and informally called evo-devo emphasises how changes between generations evolution acts on patterns of change within individual organisms development,complex
since the beginning of the st century and in light of discoveries made in recent decades some biologists have argued for an extended evolutionary synthesis which would account for the effects of non-genetic inheritance modes such as epigenetics parental effects ecological inheritance and cultural inheritance and evolvability,complex
evolution in organisms occurs through changes in heritable traits—the inherited characteristics of an organism,complex
in humans for example eye colour is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the brown-eye trait from one of their parents,complex
inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism 's genome genetic material is called its genotype,complex
the complete set of observable traits that make up the structure and behaviour of an organism is called its phenotype,complex
these traits come from the interaction of its genotype with the environment,complex
as a result many aspects of an organism 's phenotype are not inherited,complex
for example suntanned skin comes from the interaction between a person 's genotype and sunlight thus suntans are not passed on to people 's children,complex
however some people tan more easily than others due to differences in genotypic variation a striking example are people with the inherited trait of albinism who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to sunburn,complex
heritable traits are passed from one generation to the next via dna a molecule that encodes genetic information,complex
dna is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases,complex
the sequence of bases along a particular dna molecule specify the genetic information in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence,complex
before a cell divides the dna is copied so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the dna sequence,complex
portions of a dna molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes different genes have different sequences of bases,complex
within cells the long strands of dna form condensed structures called chromosomes,complex
the specific location of a dna sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus,complex
if the dna sequence at a locus varies between individuals the different forms of this sequence are called alleles,complex
dna sequences can change through mutations producing new alleles,complex
if a mutation occurs within a gene the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls altering the phenotype of the organism,complex
however while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci multiple interacting genes,complex
recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that can not be explained by changes to the sequence of nucleotides in the dna,complex
these phenomena are classed as epigenetic inheritance systems,complex
dna methylation marking chromatin self-sustaining metabolic loops gene silencing by rna interference and the three-dimensional conformation of proteins such as prions are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level,complex
developmental biologists suggest that complex interactions in genetic networks and communication among cells can lead to heritable variations that may underlay some of the mechanics in developmental plasticity and canalisation,complex
heritability may also occur at even larger scales,complex
for example ecological inheritance through the process of niche construction is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment,complex
this generates a legacy of effects that modify and feed back into the selection regime of subsequent generations,complex
descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors,complex
other examples of heritability in evolution that are not under the direct control of genes include the inheritance of cultural traits and symbiogenesis,complex
an individual organism 's phenotype results from both its genotype and the influence from the environment it has lived in,complex
a substantial part of the phenotypic variation in a population is caused by genotypic variation,complex
the modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic variation,complex
the frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative to other forms of that gene,complex
variation disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely,complex
natural selection will only cause evolution if there is enough genetic variation in a population,complex
before the discovery of mendelian genetics one common hypothesis was blending inheritance,complex
but with blending inheritance genetic variance would be rapidly lost making evolution by natural selection implausible,complex
the hardy–weinberg principle provides the solution to how variation is maintained in a population with mendelian inheritance,complex
the frequencies of alleles variations in a gene will remain constant in the absence of selection mutation migration and genetic drift,complex
variation comes from mutations in the genome reshuffling of genes through sexual reproduction and migration between populations gene flow,complex
despite the constant introduction of new variation through mutation and gene flow most of the genome of a species is identical in all individuals of that species,complex
however even relatively small differences in genotype can lead to dramatic differences in phenotype : for example chimpanzees and humans differ in only about of their genomes,complex
mutations are changes in the dna sequence of a cell 's genome,complex
when mutations occur they may alter the product of a gene or prevent the gene from functioning or have no effect,complex
based on studies in the fly drosophila melanogaster it has been suggested that if a mutation changes a protein produced by a gene this will probably be harmful with about of these mutations having damaging effects and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial,complex
mutations can involve large sections of a chromosome becoming duplicated usually by genetic recombination which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome,complex
extra copies of genes are a major source of the raw material needed for new genes to evolve,complex
this is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors,complex
for example the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light : three for colour vision and one for night vision all four are descended from a single ancestral gene,complex
new genes can be generated from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function,complex
this process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function,complex
other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding dna,complex
the generation of new genes can also involve small parts of several genes being duplicated with these fragments then recombining to form new combinations with new functions,complex
when new genes are assembled from shuffling pre-existing parts domains act as modules with simple independent functions which can be mixed together to produce new combinations with new and complex functions,complex
for example polyketide synthases are large enzymes that make antibiotics they contain up to one hundred independent domains that each catalyse one step in the overall process like a step in an assembly line,complex
in asexual organisms genes are inherited together or linked as they can not mix with genes of other organisms during reproduction,complex
in contrast the offspring of sexual organisms contain random mixtures of their parents ' chromosomes that are produced through independent assortment,complex
in a related process called homologous recombination sexual organisms exchange dna between two matching chromosomes,complex
recombination and reassortment do not alter allele frequencies but instead change which alleles are associated with each other producing offspring with new combinations of alleles,complex
sex usually increases genetic variation and may increase the rate of evolution,complex
the two-fold cost of sex was first described by john maynard smith,complex
the first cost is that in sexually dimorphic species only one of the two sexes can bear young,complex
this cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species like most plants and many invertebrates,complex
the second cost is that any individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on of its genes to any individual offspring with even less passed on as each new generation passes,complex
yet sexual reproduction is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms,complex
the red queen hypothesis has been used to explain the significance of sexual reproduction as a means to enable continual evolution and adaptation in response to coevolution with other species in an ever-changing environment,complex
gene flow is the exchange of genes between populations and between species,complex
it can therefore be a source of variation that is new to a population or to a species,complex
gene flow can be caused by the movement of individuals between separate populations of organisms as might be caused by the movement of mice between inland and coastal populations or the movement of pollen between heavy-metal-tolerant and heavy-metal-sensitive populations of grasses,complex
gene transfer between species includes the formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer,complex
horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring this is most common among bacteria,complex
in medicine this contributes to the spread of antibiotic resistance as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species,complex
horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil callosobruchus chinensis has occurred,complex
an example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers which have received a range of genes from bacteria fungi and plants,complex
viruses can also carry dna between organisms allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains,complex
large-scale gene transfer has also occurred between the ancestors of eukaryotic cells and bacteria during the acquisition of chloroplasts and mitochondria,complex
it is possible that eukaryotes themselves originated from horizontal gene transfers between bacteria and archaea,complex
from a neo-darwinian perspective evolution occurs when there are changes in the frequencies of alleles within a population of interbreeding organisms for example the allele for black colour in a population of moths becoming more common,complex
mechanisms that can lead to changes in allele frequencies include natural selection genetic drift genetic hitchhiking mutation and gene flow,complex
evolution by means of natural selection is the process by which traits that enhance survival and reproduction become more common in successive generations of a population,complex
it has often been called a self-evident mechanism because it necessarily follows from three simple facts : variation exists within populations of organisms with respect to morphology physiology and behaviour phenotypic variation,complex
different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction differential fitness,complex
these traits can be passed from generation to generation heritability of fitness,complex
more offspring are produced than can possibly survive and these conditions produce competition between organisms for survival and reproduction,complex
consequently organisms with traits that give them an advantage over their competitors are more likely to pass on their traits to the next generation than those with traits that do not confer an advantage,complex
this teleonomy is the quality whereby the process of natural selection creates and preserves traits that are seemingly fitted for the functional roles they perform,complex
consequences of selection include nonrandom mating and genetic hitchhiking,complex
the central concept of natural selection is the evolutionary fitness of an organism,complex
fitness is measured by an organism 's ability to survive and reproduce which determines the size of its genetic contribution to the next generation,complex
however fitness is not the same as the total number of offspring : instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism 's genes,complex
for example if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness,complex
if an allele increases fitness more than the other alleles of that gene then with each generation this allele will become more common within the population,complex
these traits are said to be selected for,complex
examples of traits that can increase fitness are enhanced survival and increased fecundity,complex
conversely the lower fitness caused by having a less beneficial or deleterious allele results in this allele becoming rarer—they are selected against,complex
importantly the fitness of an allele is not a fixed characteristic if the environment changes previously neutral or harmful traits may become beneficial and previously beneficial traits become harmful,complex
however even if the direction of selection does reverse in this way traits that were lost in the past may not re-evolve in an identical form see dollo 's law,complex
however a re-activation of dormant genes as long as they have not been eliminated from the genome and were only suppressed perhaps for hundreds of generations can lead to the re-occurrence of traits thought to be lost like hindlegs in dolphins teeth in chickens wings in wingless stick insects tails and additional nipples in humans etc,complex
throwbacks such as these are known as atavisms,complex
natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values such as height can be categorised into three different types,complex
the first is directional selection which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example organisms slowly getting taller,complex
secondly disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common with selection against the average value,complex
this would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage but not those of medium height,complex
finally in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity,complex
this would for example cause organisms to eventually have a similar height,complex
a special case of natural selection is sexual selection which is selection for any trait that increases mating success by increasing the attractiveness of an organism to potential mates,complex
traits that evolved through sexual selection are particularly prominent among males of several animal species,complex
although sexually favoured traits such as cumbersome antlers mating calls large body size and bright colours often attract predation which compromises the survival of individual males,complex
this survival disadvantage is balanced by higher reproductive success in males that show these hard-to-fake sexually selected traits,complex
natural selection most generally makes nature the measure against which individuals and individual traits are more or less likely to survive,complex
nature in this sense refers to an ecosystem that is a system in which organisms interact with every other element physical as well as biological in their local environment,complex
eugene odum a founder of ecology defined an ecosystem as : any unit that includes all of the organisms,complex
in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure biotic diversity and material cycles i,complex
e,complex
exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts within the system,complex
,complex
each population within an ecosystem occupies a distinct niche or position with distinct relationships to other parts of the system,complex
these relationships involve the life history of the organism its position in the food chain and its geographic range,complex
this broad understanding of nature enables scientists to delineate specific forces which together comprise natural selection,complex
natural selection can act at different levels of organisation such as genes cells individual organisms groups of organisms and species,complex
selection can act at multiple levels simultaneously,complex
an example of selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons which can replicate and spread throughout a genome,complex
selection at a level above the individual such as group selection may allow the evolution of cooperation as discussed below,complex
in addition to being a major source of variation mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur a process known as mutation bias,complex
if two genotypes for example one with the nucleotide g and another with the nucleotide a in the same position have the same fitness but mutation from g to a happens more often than mutation from a to g then genotypes with a will tend to evolve,complex
different insertion vs,complex
deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes,complex
developmental or mutational biases have also been observed in morphological evolution,complex
for example according to the phenotype-first theory of evolution mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment,complex
mutation bias effects are superimposed on other processes,complex
if selection would favour either one out of two mutations but there is no extra advantage to having both then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population,complex
mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new fully functional gene,complex
most loss of function mutations are selected against,complex
but when selection is weak mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution,complex
for example pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves and tend to be lost,complex
this kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias and/or because the function had a cost and once the benefit of the function disappeared natural selection leads to the loss,complex
loss of sporulation ability in bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability,complex
when there is no selection for loss of function the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift,complex
in parasitic organisms mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in ehrlichia,complex
mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins,complex
genetic drift is the random fluctuations of allele frequencies within a population from one generation to the next,complex
when selective forces are absent or relatively weak allele frequencies are equally likely to drift upward or downward at each successive generation because the alleles are subject to sampling error,complex
this drift halts when an allele eventually becomes fixed either by disappearing from the population or replacing the other alleles entirely,complex
genetic drift may therefore eliminate some alleles from a population due to chance alone,complex
even in the absence of selective forces genetic drift can cause two separate populations that began with the same genetic structure to drift apart into two divergent populations with different sets of alleles,complex
the neutral theory of molecular evolution proposed that most evolutionary changes are the result of the fixation of neutral mutations by genetic drift,complex
hence in this model most genetic changes in a population are the result of constant mutation pressure and genetic drift,complex
this form of the neutral theory is now largely abandoned since it does not seem to fit the genetic variation seen in nature,complex
however a more recent and better-supported version of this model is the nearly neutral theory where a mutation that would be effectively neutral in a small population is not necessarily neutral in a large population,complex
other alternative theories propose that genetic drift is dwarfed by other stochastic forces in evolution such as genetic hitchhiking also known as genetic draft,complex
the time for a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on population size with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations,complex
the number of individuals in a population is not critical but instead a measure known as the effective population size,complex
the effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding and the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest,complex
the effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population,complex
it is usually difficult to measure the relative importance of selection and neutral processes including drift,complex
the comparative importance of adaptive and non-adaptive forces in driving evolutionary change is an area of current research,complex
recombination allows alleles on the same strand of dna to become separated,complex
however the rate of recombination is low approximately two events per chromosome per generation,complex
as a result genes close together on a chromosome may not always be shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together a phenomenon known as linkage,complex
this tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations which is called their linkage disequilibrium,complex
a set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype,complex
this can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial : natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft,complex
genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size,complex
gene flow involves the exchange of genes between populations and between species,complex
the presence or absence of gene flow fundamentally changes the course of evolution,complex
due to the complexity of organisms any two completely isolated populations will eventually evolve genetic incompatibilities through neutral processes as in the bateson-dobzhansky-muller model even if both populations remain essentially identical in terms of their adaptation to the environment,complex
if genetic differentiation between populations develops gene flow between populations can introduce traits or alleles which are disadvantageous in the local population and this may lead to organisms within these populations evolving mechanisms that prevent mating with genetically distant populations eventually resulting in the appearance of new species,complex
thus exchange of genetic information between individuals is fundamentally important for the development of the biological species concept bsc,complex
during the development of the modern synthesis sewall wright developed his shifting balance theory which regarded gene flow between partially isolated populations as an important aspect of adaptive evolution,complex
however recently there has been substantial criticism of the importance of the shifting balance theory,complex
evolution influences every aspect of the form and behaviour of organisms,complex
most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection,complex
these adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food avoiding predators or attracting mates,complex
organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis,complex
in the longer term evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that can not or will not interbreed,complex
these outcomes of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution,complex
macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species in particular speciation and extinction whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population in particular shifts in allele frequency and adaptation,complex
in general macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution,complex
thus the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one—the difference is simply the time involved,complex
however in macroevolution the traits of the entire species may be important,complex
for instance a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats lessening the chance of it going extinct while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated,complex
in this sense microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms versus macroevolutionary processes such as species selection acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction,complex
a common misconception is that evolution has goals long-term plans or an innate tendency for progress as expressed in beliefs such as orthogenesis and evolutionism realistically however evolution has no long-term goal and does not necessarily produce greater complexity,complex
although complex species have evolved they occur as a side effect of the overall number of organisms increasing and simple forms of life still remain more common in the biosphere,complex
for example the overwhelming majority of species are microscopic prokaryotes which form about half the world 's biomass despite their small size and constitute the vast majority of earth 's biodiversity,complex
simple organisms have therefore been the dominant form of life on earth throughout its history and continue to be the main form of life up to the present day with complex life only appearing more diverse because it is more noticeable,complex
indeed the evolution of microorganisms is particularly important to modern evolutionary research since their rapid reproduction allows the study of experimental evolution and the observation of evolution and adaptation in real time,complex
adaptation is the process that makes organisms better suited to their habitat,complex
also the term adaptation may refer to a trait that is important for an organism 's survival,complex
for example the adaptation of horses ' teeth to the grinding of grass,complex
by using the term adaptation for the evolutionary process and adaptive trait for the product the bodily part or function the two senses of the word may be distinguished,complex
adaptations are produced by natural selection,complex
the following definitions are due to theodosius dobzhansky : adaptation is the evolutionary process whereby an organism becomes better able to live in its habitat or habitats,complex
adaptedness is the state of being adapted : the degree to which an organism is able to live and reproduce in a given set of habitats,complex
an adaptive trait is an aspect of the developmental pattern of the organism which enables or enhances the probability of that organism surviving and reproducing,complex
adaptation may cause either the gain of a new feature or the loss of an ancestral feature,complex
an example that shows both types of change is bacterial adaptation to antibiotic selection with genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance by both modifying the target of the drug or increasing the activity of transporters that pump the drug out of the cell,complex
other striking examples are the bacteria escherichia coli evolving the ability to use citric acid as a nutrient in a long-term laboratory experiment flavobacterium evolving a novel enzyme that allows these bacteria to grow on the by-products of nylon manufacturing and the soil bacterium sphingobium evolving an entirely new metabolic pathway that degrades the synthetic pesticide pentachlorophenol,complex
an interesting but still controversial idea is that some adaptations might increase the ability of organisms to generate genetic diversity and adapt by natural selection increasing organisms ' evolvability,complex
adaptation occurs through the gradual modification of existing structures,complex
consequently structures with similar internal organisation may have different functions in related organisms,complex
this is the result of a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways,complex
the bones within bat wings for example are very similar to those in mice feet and primate hands due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor,complex
however since all living organisms are related to some extent even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity such as arthropod squid and vertebrate eyes or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function this is called deep homology,complex
during evolution some structures may lose their original function and become vestigial structures,complex
such structures may have little or no function in a current species yet have a clear function in ancestral species or other closely related species,complex
examples include pseudogenes the non-functional remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish wings in flightless birds the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction,complex
examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth the coccyx the vermiform appendix and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes,complex
however many traits that appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations : structures originally adapted for one function but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process,complex
one example is the african lizard holaspis guentheri which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices as can be seen by looking at its near relatives,complex
however in this species the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation,complex
within cells molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions,complex
another example is the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms ' eyes,complex
an area of current investigation in evolutionary developmental biology is the developmental basis of adaptations and exaptations,complex
this research addresses the origin and evolution of embryonic development and how modifications of development and developmental processes produce novel features,complex
these studies have shown that evolution can alter development to produce new structures such as embryonic bone structures that develop into the jaw in other animals instead forming part of the middle ear in mammals,complex
it is also possible for structures that have been lost in evolution to reappear due to changes in developmental genes such as a mutation in chickens causing embryos to grow teeth similar to those of crocodiles,complex
it is now becoming clear that most alterations in the form of organisms are due to changes in a small set of conserved genes,complex
interactions between organisms can produce both conflict and cooperation,complex
when the interaction is between pairs of species such as a pathogen and a host or a predator and its prey these species can develop matched sets of adaptations,complex
here the evolution of one species causes adaptations in a second species,complex
these changes in the second species then in turn cause new adaptations in the first species,complex
this cycle of selection and response is called coevolution,complex
an example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt and the evolution of tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator the common garter snake,complex
in this predator-prey pair an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake,complex
not all co-evolved interactions between species involve conflict,complex
many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved,complex
for instance an extreme cooperation exists between plants and the mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients from the soil,complex
this is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis,complex
here the fungi actually grow inside plant cells allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system,complex
coalitions between organisms of the same species have also evolved,complex
an extreme case is the eusociality found in social insects such as bees termites and ants where sterile insects feed and guard the small number of organisms in a colony that are able to reproduce,complex
on an even smaller scale the somatic cells that make up the body of an animal limit their reproduction so they can maintain a stable organism which then supports a small number of the animal 's germ cells to produce offspring,complex
here somatic cells respond to specific signals that instruct them whether to grow remain as they are or die,complex
if cells ignore these signals and multiply inappropriately their uncontrolled growth causes cancer,complex
such cooperation within species may have evolved through the process of kin selection which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative 's offspring,complex
this activity is selected for because if the helping individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity it is likely that its kin will also contain these alleles and thus those alleles will be passed on,complex
other processes that may promote cooperation include group selection where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms,complex
speciation is the process where a species diverges into two or more descendant species,complex
there are multiple ways to define the concept of species,complex
the choice of definition is dependent on the particularities of the species concerned,complex
for example some species concepts apply more readily toward sexually reproducing organisms while others lend themselves better toward asexual organisms,complex
despite the diversity of various species concepts these various concepts can be placed into one of three broad philosophical approaches : interbreeding ecological and phylogenetic,complex
the biological species concept bsc is a classic example of the interbreeding approach,complex
defined by evolutionary biologist ernst mayr in the bsc states that species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups,complex
despite its wide and long-term use the bsc like others is not without controversy for example because these concepts can not be applied to prokaryotes and this is called the species problem,complex
some researchers have attempted a unifying monistic definition of species while others adopt a pluralistic approach and suggest that there may be different ways to logically interpret the definition of a species,complex
barriers to reproduction between two diverging sexual populations are required for the populations to become new species,complex
gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations,complex
depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor it may still be possible for them to produce offspring as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules,complex
such hybrids are generally infertile,complex
in this case closely related species may regularly interbreed but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct,complex
however viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between their parent species or possess a totally new phenotype,complex
the importance of hybridisation in producing new species of animals is unclear although cases have been seen in many types of animals with the gray tree frog being a particularly well-studied example,complex
speciation has been observed multiple times under both controlled laboratory conditions see laboratory experiments of speciation and in nature,complex
in sexually reproducing organisms speciation results from reproductive isolation followed by genealogical divergence,complex
there are four primary geographic modes of speciation,complex
the most common in animals is allopatric speciation which occurs in populations initially isolated geographically such as by habitat fragmentation or migration,complex
selection under these conditions can produce very rapid changes in the appearance and behaviour of organisms,complex
as selection and drift act independently on populations isolated from the rest of their species separation may eventually produce organisms that can not interbreed,complex
the second mode of speciation is peripatric speciation which occurs when small populations of organisms become isolated in a new environment,complex
this differs from allopatric speciation in that the isolated populations are numerically much smaller than the parental population,complex
here the founder effect causes rapid speciation after an increase in inbreeding increases selection on homozygotes leading to rapid genetic change,complex
the third mode is parapatric speciation,complex
this is similar to peripatric speciation in that a small population enters a new habitat but differs in that there is no physical separation between these two populations,complex
instead speciation results from the evolution of mechanisms that reduce gene flow between the two populations,complex
generally this occurs when there has been a drastic change in the environment within the parental species ' habitat,complex
one example is the grass anthoxanthum odoratum which can undergo parapatric speciation in response to localised metal pollution from mines,complex
here plants evolve that have resistance to high levels of metals in the soil,complex
selection against interbreeding with the metal-sensitive parental population produced a gradual change in the flowering time of the metal-resistant plants which eventually produced complete reproductive isolation,complex
selection against hybrids between the two populations may cause reinforcement which is the evolution of traits that promote mating within a species as well as character displacement which is when two species become more distinct in appearance,complex
finally in sympatric speciation species diverge without geographic isolation or changes in habitat,complex
this form is rare since even a small amount of gene flow may remove genetic differences between parts of a population,complex
generally sympatric speciation in animals requires the evolution of both genetic differences and nonrandom mating to allow reproductive isolation to evolve,complex
one type of sympatric speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species to produce a new hybrid species,complex
this is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile,complex
this is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and can not successfully pair,complex
however it is more common in plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes to form polyploids,complex
this allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis since each parent 's chromosomes are represented by a pair already,complex
an example of such a speciation event is when the plant species arabidopsis thaliana and arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species arabidopsis suecica,complex
this happened about years ago and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process,complex
indeed chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms,complex
speciation events are important in the theory of punctuated equilibrium which accounts for the pattern in the fossil record of short bursts of evolution interspersed with relatively long periods of stasis where species remain relatively unchanged,complex
in this theory speciation and rapid evolution are linked with natural selection and genetic drift acting most strongly on organisms undergoing speciation in novel habitats or small populations,complex
as a result the periods of stasis in the fossil record correspond to the parental population and the organisms undergoing speciation and rapid evolution are found in small populations or geographically restricted habitats and therefore rarely being preserved as fossils,complex
extinction is the disappearance of an entire species,complex
extinction is not an unusual event as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction,complex
nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on earth are now extinct and extinction appears to be the ultimate fate of all species,complex
these extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events,complex
the cretaceous–paleogene extinction event during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct is the most well-known but the earlier permian–triassic extinction event was even more severe with approximately of all marine species driven to extinction,complex
the holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity 's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years,complex
present-day extinction rates are – times greater than the background rate and up to of current species may be extinct by the mid st century,complex
human activities are now the primary cause of the ongoing extinction event global warming may further accelerate it in the future,complex
despite the estimated extinction of more than percent of all species that ever lived on earth about trillion species are estimated to be on earth currently with only one-thousandth of one percent described,complex
the role of extinction in evolution is not very well understood and may depend on which type of extinction is considered,complex
the causes of the continuous low-level extinction events which form the majority of extinctions may be the result of competition between species for limited resources the competitive exclusion principle,complex
if one species can out-compete another this could produce species selection with the fitter species surviving and the other species being driven to extinction,complex
the intermittent mass extinctions are also important but instead of acting as a selective force they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of rapid evolution and speciation in survivors,complex

the earth is about,complex
billion years old,complex
the earliest undisputed evidence of life on earth dates from at least,complex
billion years ago during the eoarchean era after a geological crust started to solidify following the earlier molten hadean eon,complex
microbial mat fossils have been found in,complex
billion-year-old sandstone in western australia,complex
other early physical evidence of a biogenic substance is graphite in,complex
billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in western greenland as well as remains of biotic life found in,complex
billion-year-old rocks in western australia,complex
commenting on the australian findings stephen blair hedges wrote if life arose relatively quickly on earth then it could be common in the universe,complex
in july scientists reported identifying a set of genes from the last universal common ancestor luca of all organisms living on earth,complex
more than percent of all species amounting to over five billion species that ever lived on earth are estimated to be extinct,complex
estimates on the number of earth 's current species range from million to million of which about,complex
million are estimated to have been named and,complex
million documented in a central database to date leaving at least percent not yet described,complex
highly energetic chemistry is thought to have produced a self-replicating molecule around billion years ago and half a billion years later the last common ancestor of all life existed,complex
the current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions,complex
the beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as rna and the assembly of simple cells,complex
all organisms on earth are descended from a common ancestor or ancestral gene pool,complex
current species are a stage in the process of evolution with their diversity the product of a long series of speciation and extinction events,complex
the common descent of organisms was first deduced from four simple facts about organisms : first they have geographic distributions that can not be explained by local adaptation,complex
second the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms but organisms that share morphological similarities,complex
third vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits and finally that organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups—similar to a family tree,complex
however modern research has suggested that due to horizontal gene transfer this tree of life may be more complicated than a simple branching tree since some genes have spread independently between distantly related species,complex
past species have also left records of their evolutionary history,complex
fossils along with the comparative anatomy of present-day organisms constitute the morphological or anatomical record,complex
by comparing the anatomies of both modern and extinct species paleontologists can infer the lineages of those species,complex
however this approach is most successful for organisms that had hard body parts such as shells bones or teeth,complex
further as prokaryotes such as bacteria and archaea share a limited set of common morphologies their fossils do not provide information on their ancestry,complex
more recently evidence for common descent has come from the study of biochemical similarities between organisms,complex
for example all living cells use the same basic set of nucleotides and amino acids,complex
the development of molecular genetics has revealed the record of evolution left in organisms ' genomes : dating when species diverged through the molecular clock produced by mutations,complex
for example these dna sequence comparisons have revealed that humans and chimpanzees share of their genomes and analysing the few areas where they differ helps shed light on when the common ancestor of these species existed,complex
prokaryotes inhabited the earth from approximately – billion years ago,complex
no obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms over the next few billion years,complex
the eukaryotic cells emerged between,complex
–,complex
billion years ago,complex
the next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis,complex
the engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes,complex
another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms led to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants,complex
the history of life was that of the unicellular eukaryotes prokaryotes and archaea until about million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the ediacaran period,complex
the evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events in organisms as diverse as sponges brown algae cyanobacteria slime moulds and myxobacteria,complex
in january scientists reported that about million years ago a minor genetic change in a single molecule called gk-pid may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells,complex
soon after the emergence of these first multicellular organisms a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately million years in an event called the cambrian explosion,complex
here the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record as well as unique lineages that subsequently became extinct,complex
various triggers for the cambrian explosion have been proposed including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis,complex
about million years ago plants and fungi colonised the land and were soon followed by arthropods and other animals,complex
insects were particularly successful and even today make up the majority of animal species,complex
amphibians first appeared around million years ago followed by early amniotes and birds around million years ago both from reptile-like lineages mammals around million years ago homininae around million years ago and modern humans around years ago,complex
however despite the evolution of these large animals smaller organisms similar to the types that evolved early in this process continue to be highly successful and dominate the earth with the majority of both biomass and species being prokaryotes,complex
concepts and models used in evolutionary biology such as natural selection have many applications,complex
artificial selection is the intentional selection of traits in a population of organisms,complex
this has been used for thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals,complex
more recently such selection has become a vital part of genetic engineering with selectable markers such as antibiotic resistance genes being used to manipulate dna,complex
proteins with valuable properties have evolved by repeated rounds of mutation and selection for example modified enzymes and new antibodies in a process called directed evolution,complex
understanding the changes that have occurred during an organism 's evolution can reveal the genes needed to construct parts of the body genes which may be involved in human genetic disorders,complex
for example the mexican tetra is an albino cavefish that lost its eyesight during evolution,complex
breeding together different populations of this blind fish produced some offspring with functional eyes since different mutations had occurred in the isolated populations that had evolved in different caves,complex
this helped identify genes required for vision and pigmentation,complex
evolutionary theory has many applications in medicine,complex
many human diseases are not static phenomena but capable of evolution,complex
viruses bacteria fungi and cancers evolve to be resistant to host immune defences as well as pharmaceutical drugs,complex
these same problems occur in agriculture with pesticide and herbicide resistance,complex
it is possible that we are facing the end of the effective life of most of available antibiotics and predicting the evolution and evolvability of our pathogens and devising strategies to slow or circumvent it is requiring deeper knowledge of the complex forces driving evolution at the molecular level,complex
in computer science simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life started in the s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection,complex
artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of ingo rechenberg in the s,complex
he used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems,complex
genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of john henry holland,complex
practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes,complex
evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems,complex
in the th century particularly after the publication of on the origin of species in the idea that life had evolved was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical social and religious implications of evolution,complex
today the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists,complex
however evolution remains a contentious concept for some theists,complex
while various religions and denominations have reconciled their beliefs with evolution through concepts such as theistic evolution there are creationists who believe that evolution is contradicted by the creation myths found in their religions and who raise various objections to evolution,complex
as had been demonstrated by responses to the publication of vestiges of the natural history of creation in the most controversial aspect of evolutionary biology is the implication of human evolution that humans share common ancestry with apes and that the mental and moral faculties of humanity have the same types of natural causes as other inherited traits in animals,complex
in some countries notably the united states these tensions between science and religion have fuelled the current creation–evolution controversy a religious conflict focusing on politics and public education,complex
while other scientific fields such as cosmology and earth science also conflict with literal interpretations of many religious texts evolutionary biology experiences significantly more opposition from religious literalists,complex
the teaching of evolution in american secondary school biology classes was uncommon in most of the first half of the th century,complex
the scopes trial decision of caused the subject to become very rare in american secondary biology textbooks for a generation but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the epperson v,complex
arkansas decision,complex
since then the competing religious belief of creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the s and s but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design id to be excluded once again in the kitzmiller v,complex
dover area school district case,complex
derived from the greek ἀνατομή anatomē dissection from ἀνατέμνω anatémnō i cut up cut open from ἀνά aná up and τέμνω témnō i cut anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems organs and tissues,complex
it includes the appearance and position of the various parts the materials from which they are composed their locations and their relationships with other parts,complex
anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved,complex
cancers are a large family of diseases that involve abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body,complex
they form a subset of neoplasms,complex
a neoplasm or tumor is a group of cells that have undergone unregulated growth and will often form a mass or lump but may be distributed diffusely,complex
all tumor cells show the six hallmarks of cancer,complex
these characteristics are required to produce a malignant tumor,complex
they include : cell growth and division absent the proper signals continuous growth and division even given contrary signals avoidance of programmed cell death limitless number of cell divisions promoting blood vessel construction invasion of tissue and formation of metastasesthe progression from normal cells to cells that can form a detectable mass to outright cancer involves multiple steps known as malignant progression,complex
when cancer begins it produces no symptoms,complex
signs and symptoms appear as the mass grows or ulcerates,complex
the findings that result depend on the cancer 's type and location,complex
few symptoms are specific,complex
many frequently occur in individuals who have other conditions,complex
cancer is a great imitator,complex
thus it is common for people diagnosed with cancer to have been treated for other diseases which were hypothesized to be causing their symptoms,complex
people may become anxious or depressed post-diagnosis,complex
the risk of suicide in people with cancer is approximately double,complex
local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration,complex
for example mass effects from lung cancer can block the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia esophageal cancer can cause narrowing of the esophagus making it difficult or painful to swallow and colorectal cancer may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel affecting bowel habits,complex
masses in breasts or testicles may produce observable lumps,complex
ulceration can cause bleeding that if it occurs in the lung will lead to coughing up blood in the bowels to anemia or rectal bleeding in the bladder to blood in the urine and in the uterus to vaginal bleeding,complex
although localized pain may occur in advanced cancer the initial swelling is usually painless,complex
some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen,complex
general symptoms occur due to effects that are not related to direct or metastatic spread,complex
these may include : unintentional weight loss fever excessive fatigue and changes to the skin,complex
hodgkin disease leukemias and cancers of the liver or kidney can cause a persistent fever,complex
some cancers may cause specific groups of systemic symptoms termed paraneoplastic syndrome,complex
examples include the appearance of myasthenia gravis in thymoma and clubbing in lung cancer,complex
cancer can spread from its original site by local spread lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes or by hematogenous spread via the blood to distant sites known as metastasis,complex
when cancer spreads by a hematogenous route it usually spreads all over the body,complex
however cancer 'seeds ' grow in certain selected site only 'soil ' as hypothesized in the soil and seed hypothesis of cancer metastasis,complex
the symptoms of metastatic cancers depend on the tumor location and can include enlarged lymph nodes which can be felt or sometimes seen under the skin and are typically hard enlarged liver or enlarged spleen which can be felt in the abdomen pain or fracture of affected bones and neurological symptoms,complex
the majority of cancers some – of cases are due to genetic mutations from environmental factors,complex
the remaining – are due to inherited genetics,complex
environmental as used by cancer researchers means any cause that is not inherited genetically such as lifestyle economic and behavioral factors and not merely pollution,complex
common environmental factors that contribute to cancer death include tobacco – diet and obesity – infections – radiation both ionizing and non-ionizing up to stress lack of physical activity and pollution,complex
it is not generally possible to prove what caused a particular cancer because the various causes do not have specific fingerprints,complex
for example if a person who uses tobacco heavily develops lung cancer then it was probably caused by the tobacco use but since everyone has a small chance of developing lung cancer as a result of air pollution or radiation the cancer may have developed for one of those reasons,complex
excepting the rare transmissions that occur with pregnancies and occasional organ donors cancer is generally not a transmissible disease,complex
exposure to particular substances have been linked to specific types of cancer,complex
these substances are called carcinogens,complex
tobacco smoke for example causes of lung cancer,complex
it also causes cancer in the larynx head neck stomach bladder kidney esophagus and pancreas,complex
tobacco smoke contains over fifty known carcinogens including nitrosamines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,complex
tobacco is responsible for about one in five cancer deaths worldwide and about one in three in the developed world,complex
lung cancer death rates in the united states have mirrored smoking patterns with increases in smoking followed by dramatic increases in lung cancer death rates and more recently decreases in smoking rates since the s followed by decreases in lung cancer death rates in men since,complex
in western europe of cancers in males and of cancers in females are attributed to alcohol exposure especially liver and digestive tract cancers,complex
cancer from work-related substance exposures may cause between and of cases causing at least deaths,complex
cancers such as lung cancer and mesothelioma can come from inhaling tobacco smoke or asbestos fibers or leukemia from exposure to benzene,complex
diet physical inactivity and obesity are related to up to – of cancer deaths,complex
in the united states excess body weight is associated with the development of many types of cancer and is a factor in – of cancer deaths,complex
a uk study including data on over million people showed higher body mass index to be related to at least types of cancer and responsible for around cases each year in that country,complex
physical inactivity is believed to contribute to cancer risk not only through its effect on body weight but also through negative effects on the immune system and endocrine system,complex
more than half of the effect from diet is due to overnutrition eating too much rather than from eating too few vegetables or other healthful foods,complex
some specific foods are linked to specific cancers,complex
a high-salt diet is linked to gastric cancer,complex
aflatoxin b a frequent food contaminant causes liver cancer,complex
betel nut chewing can cause oral cancer,complex
national differences in dietary practices may partly explain differences in cancer incidence,complex
for example gastric cancer is more common in japan due to its high-salt diet while colon cancer is more common in the united states,complex
immigrant cancer profiles develop mirror that of their new country often within one generation,complex
worldwide approximately of cancer deaths are related to infectious diseases,complex
this proportion ranges from a high of in africa to less than in the developed world,complex
viruses are the usual infectious agents that cause cancer but cancer bacteria and parasites may also play a role,complex
oncoviruses viruses that can cause cancer include human papillomavirus cervical cancer epstein–barr virus b-cell lymphoproliferative disease and nasopharyngeal carcinoma kaposi 's sarcoma herpesvirus kaposi 's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphomas hepatitis b and hepatitis c viruses hepatocellular carcinoma and human t-cell leukemia virus- t-cell leukemias,complex
bacterial infection may also increase the risk of cancer as seen in helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinoma,complex
parasitic infections associated with cancer include schistosoma haematobium squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder and the liver flukes opisthorchis viverrini and clonorchis sinensis cholangiocarcinoma,complex
up to of invasive cancers are related to radiation exposure including both ionizing radiation and non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation,complex
additionally the majority of non-invasive cancers are non-melanoma skin cancers caused by non-ionizing ultraviolet radiation mostly from sunlight,complex
sources of ionizing radiation include medical imaging and radon gas,complex
ionizing radiation is not a particularly strong mutagen,complex
residential exposure to radon gas for example has similar cancer risks as passive smoking,complex
radiation is a more potent source of cancer when combined with other cancer-causing agents such as radon plus tobacco smoke,complex
radiation can cause cancer in most parts of the body in all animals and at any age,complex
children and adolescents are twice as likely to develop radiation-induced leukemia as adults radiation exposure before birth has ten times the effect,complex
medical use of ionizing radiation is a small but growing source of radiation-induced cancers,complex
ionizing radiation may be used to treat other cancers but this may in some cases induce a second form of cancer,complex
it is also used in some kinds of medical imaging,complex
prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies,complex
clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation especially the non-ionizing medium wave uvb as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers which are the most common forms of cancer in the world,complex
non-ionizing radio frequency radiation from mobile phones electric power transmission and other similar sources have been described as a possible carcinogen by the world health organization 's international agency for research on cancer,complex
however studies have not found a consistent link between mobile phone radiation and cancer risk,complex
the vast majority of cancers are non-hereditary sporadic,complex
hereditary cancers are primarily caused by an inherited genetic defect,complex
less than,complex
of the population are carriers of a genetic mutation that has a large effect on cancer risk and these cause less than – of cancer,complex
some of these syndromes include : certain inherited mutations in the genes brca and brca with a more than risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer hnpcc or lynch syndrome which is present in about of people with colorectal cancer among others,complex
statistically for cancers causing most mortality the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer when a first-degree relative parent sibling or child has been diagnosed with it is about,complex
the corresponding relative risk is,complex
for lung cancer and,complex
for prostate cancer,complex
for breast cancer the relative risk is,complex
with a first-degree relative having developed it at years of age or older and,complex
when the relative developed it when being younger than years of age,complex
taller people have an increased risk of cancer because they have more cells than shorter people,complex
since height is genetically determined to a large extent taller people have a heritable increase of cancer risk,complex
some substances cause cancer primarily through their physical rather than chemical effects,complex
a prominent example of this is prolonged exposure to asbestos naturally occurring mineral fibers that are a major cause of mesothelioma cancer of the serous membrane usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs,complex
other substances in this category including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers such as wollastonite attapulgite glass wool and rock wool are believed to have similar effects,complex
non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel and crystalline silica quartz cristobalite and tridymite,complex
usually physical carcinogens must get inside the body such as through inhalation and require years of exposure to produce cancer,complex
physical trauma resulting in cancer is relatively rare,complex
claims that breaking bones resulted in bone cancer for example have not been proven,complex
similarly physical trauma is not accepted as a cause for cervical cancer breast cancer or brain cancer,complex
one accepted source is frequent long-term application of hot objects to the body,complex
it is possible that repeated burns on the same part of the body such as those produced by kanger and kairo heaters charcoal hand warmers may produce skin cancer especially if carcinogenic chemicals are also present,complex
frequent consumption of scalding hot tea may produce esophageal cancer,complex
generally it is believed that cancer arises or a pre-existing cancer is encouraged during the process of healing rather than directly by the trauma,complex
however repeated injuries to the same tissues might promote excessive cell proliferation which could then increase the odds of a cancerous mutation,complex
chronic inflammation has been hypothesized to directly cause mutation,complex
inflammation can contribute to proliferation survival angiogenesis and migration of cancer cells by influencing the tumor microenvironment,complex
oncogenes build up an inflammatory pro-tumorigenic microenvironment,complex
some hormones play a role in the development of cancer by promoting cell proliferation,complex
insulin-like growth factors and their binding proteins play a key role in cancer cell proliferation differentiation and apoptosis suggesting possible involvement in carcinogenesis,complex
hormones are important agents in sex-related cancers such as cancer of the breast endometrium prostate ovary and testis and also of thyroid cancer and bone cancer,complex
for example the daughters of women who have breast cancer have significantly higher levels of estrogen and progesterone than the daughters of women without breast cancer,complex
these higher hormone levels may explain their higher risk of breast cancer even in the absence of a breast-cancer gene,complex
similarly men of african ancestry have significantly higher levels of testosterone than men of european ancestry and have a correspondingly higher level of prostate cancer,complex
men of asian ancestry with the lowest levels of testosterone-activating androstanediol glucuronide have the lowest levels of prostate cancer,complex
other factors are relevant : obese people have higher levels of some hormones associated with cancer and a higher rate of those cancers,complex
women who take hormone replacement therapy have a higher risk of developing cancers associated with those hormones,complex
on the other hand people who exercise far more than average have lower levels of these hormones and lower risk of cancer,complex
osteosarcoma may be promoted by growth hormones,complex
some treatments and prevention approaches leverage this cause by artificially reducing hormone levels and thus discouraging hormone-sensitive cancers,complex
there is an association between celiac disease and an increased risk of all cancers,complex
people with untreated celiac disease have a higher risk but this risk decreases with time after diagnosis and strict treatment probably due to the adoption of a gluten-free diet which seems to have a protective role against development of malignancy in people with celiac disease,complex
however the delay in diagnosis and initiation of a gluten-free diet seems to increase the risk of malignancies,complex
rates of gastrointestinal cancers are increased in people with crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis due to chronic inflammation,complex
also immunomodulators and biologic agents used to treat these diseases may promote developing extra-intestinal malignancies,complex
the signs and symptoms of malaria typically begin – days following infection but may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention,complex
initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis gastroenteritis and viral diseases,complex
the presentation may include headache fever shivering joint pain vomiting hemolytic anemia jaundice hemoglobin in the urine retinal damage and convulsions,complex
the classic symptom of malaria is paroxysm—a cyclical occurrence of sudden coldness followed by shivering and then fever and sweating occurring every two days tertian fever in p,complex
vivax and p,complex
ovale infections and every three days quartan fever for p,complex
malariae,complex
p,complex
falciparum infection can cause recurrent fever every – hours or a less pronounced and almost continuous fever,complex
severe malaria is usually caused by p,complex
falciparum often referred to as falciparum malaria,complex
symptoms of falciparum malaria arise – days after infection,complex
individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms including abnormal posturing nystagmus conjugate gaze palsy failure of the eyes to turn together in the same direction opisthotonus seizures or coma,complex
malaria has several serious complications,complex
among these is the development of respiratory distress which occurs in up to of adults and of children with severe p,complex
falciparum malaria,complex
possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema concomitant pneumonia and severe anaemia,complex
although rare in young children with severe malaria acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in – of adults and up to of pregnant women,complex
coinfection of hiv with malaria increases mortality,complex
renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine,complex
infection with p,complex
falciparum may result in cerebral malaria a form of severe malaria that involves encephalopathy,complex
it is associated with retinal whitening which may be a useful clinical sign in distinguishing malaria from other causes of fever,complex
enlarged spleen enlarged liver or both of these severe headache low blood sugar and hemoglobin in the urine with renal failure may occur,complex
complications may include spontaneous bleeding coagulopathy and shock,complex
malaria in pregnant women is an important cause of stillbirths infant mortality abortion and low birth weight particularly in p,complex
falciparum infection but also with p,complex
vivax,complex
malaria parasites belong to the genus plasmodium phylum apicomplexa,complex
in humans malaria is caused by p,complex
falciparum p,complex
malariae p,complex
ovale p,complex
vivax and p,complex
knowlesi,complex
among those infected p,complex
falciparum is the most common species identified followed by p,complex
vivax,complex
although p,complex
falciparum traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths recent evidence suggests that p,complex
vivax malaria is associated with potentially life-threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of p,complex
falciparum infection,complex
p,complex
vivax proportionally is more common outside africa,complex
there have been documented human infections with several species of plasmodium from higher apes however except for p,complex
knowlesi—a zoonotic species that causes malaria in macaques—these are mostly of limited public health importance,complex
in the life cycle of plasmodium a female anopheles mosquito the definitive host transmits a motile infective form called the sporozoite to a vertebrate host such as a human the secondary host thus acting as a transmission vector,complex
a sporozoite travels through the blood vessels to liver cells hepatocytes where it reproduces asexually tissue schizogony producing thousands of merozoites,complex
these infect new red blood cells and initiate a series of asexual multiplication cycles blood schizogony that produce to new infective merozoites at which point the cells burst and the infective cycle begins anew,complex
other merozoites develop into immature gametocytes which are the precursors of male and female gametes,complex
when a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut,complex
the male and female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized motile zygote,complex
ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect 's salivary glands ready to infect a new vertebrate host,complex
the sporozoites are injected into the skin in the saliva when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal,complex
only female mosquitoes feed on blood male mosquitoes feed on plant nectar and do not transmit the disease,complex
females of the mosquito genus anopheles prefer to feed at night,complex
they usually start searching for a meal at dusk and will continue throughout the night until taking a meal,complex
malaria parasites can also be transmitted by blood transfusions although this is rare,complex
symptoms of malaria can recur after varying symptom-free periods,complex
depending upon the cause recurrence can be classified as either recrudescence relapse or reinfection,complex
recrudescence is when symptoms return after a symptom-free period,complex
it is caused by parasites surviving in the blood as a result of inadequate or ineffective treatment,complex
relapse is when symptoms reappear after the parasites have been eliminated from blood but persist as dormant hypnozoites in liver cells,complex
relapse commonly occurs between – weeks and is often seen in p,complex
vivax and p,complex
ovale infections,complex
however relapse-like p,complex
vivax recurrences are probably being over-attributed to hypnozoite activation,complex
some of them might have an extra-vascular merozoite origin making these recurrences recrudescences not relapses,complex
one newly recognized non-hypnozoite possible contributing source to recurrent peripheral p,complex
vivax parasitemia is erythrocytic forms in bone marrow,complex
p,complex
vivax malaria cases in temperate areas often involve overwintering by hypnozoites with relapses beginning the year after the mosquito bite,complex
reinfection means the parasite that caused the past infection was eliminated from the body but a new parasite was introduced,complex
reinfection can not readily be distinguished from recrudescence although recurrence of infection within two weeks of treatment for the initial infection is typically attributed to treatment failure,complex
people may develop some immunity when exposed to frequent infections,complex
global climate change is likely to affect malaria transmission but the degree of effect and the areas effected is uncertain,complex
greater rainfall in certain areas of india and following an el nino event is associated with increased mosquito numbers,complex
malaria infection develops via two phases : one that involves the liver exoerythrocytic phase and one that involves red blood cells or erythrocytes erythrocytic phase,complex
when an infected mosquito pierces a person 's skin to take a blood meal sporozoites in the mosquito 's saliva enter the bloodstream and migrate to the liver where they infect hepatocytes multiplying asexually and asymptomatically for a period of – days,complex
after a potential dormant period in the liver these organisms differentiate to yield thousands of merozoites which following rupture of their host cells escape into the blood and infect red blood cells to begin the erythrocytic stage of the life cycle,complex
the parasite escapes from the liver undetected by wrapping itself in the cell membrane of the infected host liver cell,complex
within the red blood cells the parasites multiply further again asexually periodically breaking out of their host cells to invade fresh red blood cells,complex
several such amplification cycles occur,complex
thus classical descriptions of waves of fever arise from simultaneous waves of merozoites escaping and infecting red blood cells,complex
some p,complex
vivax sporozoites do not immediately develop into exoerythrocytic-phase merozoites but instead produce hypnozoites that remain dormant for periods ranging from several months – months is typical to several years,complex
after a period of dormancy they reactivate and produce merozoites,complex
hypnozoites are responsible for long incubation and late relapses in p,complex
vivax infections although their existence in p,complex
ovale is uncertain,complex
the parasite is relatively protected from attack by the body 's immune system because for most of its human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to immune surveillance,complex
however circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen,complex
to avoid this fate the p,complex
falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins on the surface of the infected blood cells causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen,complex
the blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria,complex
sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria,complex
according to a review due to the high levels of mortality and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the p,complex
falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in recent history,complex
several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait thalassaemia traits glucose -- phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and the absence of duffy antigens on red blood cells,complex
the impact of sickle cell trait on malaria immunity illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs that have occurred because of endemic malaria,complex
sickle cell trait causes a change in the hemoglobin molecule in the blood,complex
normally red blood cells have a very flexible biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries however when the modified hemoglobin s molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen or crowd together due to dehydration they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape,complex
in these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely,complex
in the early stages of malaria the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle and so they are removed from circulation sooner,complex
this reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell,complex
individuals who are homozygous with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele have sickle-cell anaemia while those who are heterozygous with one abnormal allele and one normal allele experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia,complex
although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait 's survival the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form,complex
liver dysfunction as a result of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease,complex
the syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis,complex
while it has been considered a rare occurrence malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase particularly in southeast asia and india,complex
liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death,complex
owing to the non-specific nature of the presentation of symptoms diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires a high degree of suspicion which might be elicited by any of the following : recent travel history enlarged spleen fever low number of platelets in the blood and higher-than-normal levels of bilirubin in the blood combined with a normal level of white blood cells,complex
reports in and from countries were malaria is common suggest high levels of over diagnosis due to insufficient or inaccurate laboratory testing,complex
malaria is usually confirmed by the microscopic examination of blood films or by antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests rdt,complex
in some areas rdts need to be able to distinguish whether the malaria symptoms are caused by plasmodium falciparum or by other species of parasites since treatment strategies could differ for non-p,complex
falciparum infections,complex
microscopy is the most commonly used method to detect the malarial parasite—about million blood films were examined for malaria in,complex
despite its widespread usage diagnosis by microscopy suffers from two main drawbacks : many settings especially rural are not equipped to perform the test and the accuracy of the results depends on both the skill of the person examining the blood film and the levels of the parasite in the blood,complex
the sensitivity of blood films ranges from – in optimum conditions to as low as,complex
commercially available rdts are often more accurate than blood films at predicting the presence of malaria parasites but they are widely variable in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity depending on manufacturer and are unable to tell how many parasites are present,complex
in regions where laboratory tests are readily available malaria should be suspected and tested for in any unwell person who has been in an area where malaria is endemic,complex
in areas that can not afford laboratory diagnostic tests it has become common to use only a history of fever as the indication to treat for malaria—thus the common teaching fever equals malaria unless proven otherwise,complex
a drawback of this practice is overdiagnosis of malaria and mismanagement of non-malarial fever which wastes limited resources erodes confidence in the health care system and contributes to drug resistance,complex
although polymerase chain reaction-based tests have been developed they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common as of due to their complexity,complex
malaria is classified into either severe or uncomplicated by the world health organization who,complex
it is deemed severe when any of the following criteria are present otherwise it is considered uncomplicated,complex
decreased consciousness significant weakness such that the person is unable to walk inability to feed two or more convulsions low blood pressure less than mmhg in adults and mmhg in children breathing problems circulatory shock kidney failure or hemoglobin in the urine bleeding problems or hemoglobin less than g/l g/dl pulmonary oedema blood glucose less than,complex
mmol/l mg/dl acidosis or lactate levels of greater than mmol/l a parasite level in the blood of greater than per microlitre µl in low-intensity transmission areas or per µl in high-intensity transmission areascerebral malaria is defined as a severe p,complex
falciparum-malaria presenting with neurological symptoms including coma with a glasgow coma scale less than or a blantyre coma scale less than or with a coma that lasts longer than minutes after a seizure,complex
various types of malaria have been called by the names below :,complex
methods used to prevent malaria include medications mosquito elimination and the prevention of bites,complex
there is no vaccine for malaria,complex
the presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans,complex
if any of these is lowered sufficiently the parasite will eventually disappear from that area as happened in north america europe and parts of the middle east,complex
however unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite 's reproduction,complex
furthermore the cost per person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density making it economically unfeasible in some areas,complex
prevention of malaria may be more cost-effective than treatment of the disease in the long run but the initial costs required are out of reach of many of the world 's poorest people,complex
there is a wide difference in the costs of control i,complex
e,complex
maintenance of low endemicity and elimination programs between countries,complex
for example in china—whose government in announced a strategy to pursue malaria elimination in the chinese provinces—the required investment is a small proportion of public expenditure on health,complex
in contrast a similar program in tanzania would cost an estimated one-fifth of the public health budget,complex
in areas where malaria is common children under five years old often have anemia which is sometimes due to malaria,complex
giving children with anemia in these areas preventive antimalarial medication improves red blood cell levels slightly but did not affect the risk of death or need for hospitalization,complex
vector control refers to methods used to decrease malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes,complex
for individual protection the most effective insect repellents are based on deet or picaridin,complex
insecticide-treated mosquito nets itns and indoor residual spraying irs have been shown to be highly effective in preventing malaria among children in areas where malaria is common,complex
prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies acts may also reduce transmission,complex
mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria,complex
nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net,complex
insecticide-treated nets are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than protection compared with no net,complex
between and the use of itns saved the lives of an estimated infants in sub-saharan africa,complex
about of households in sub-saharan countries owned itns in and of african households were estimated to own at least one itn in,complex
in,complex
million,complex
african children living in areas of the world where malaria is common were protected by an itn,complex
that number increased to,complex
million,complex
african children using itns in leaving,complex
million children unprotected and to african children using mosquito nets in,complex
most nets are impregnated with pyrethroids a class of insecticides with low toxicity,complex
they are most effective when used from dusk to dawn,complex
it is recommended to hang a large bed net above the center of a bed and either tuck the edges under the mattress or make sure it is large enough such that it touches the ground,complex
indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home,complex
after feeding many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite,complex
as of the world health organization recommends insecticides in irs operations including ddt and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin,complex
this public health use of small amounts of ddt is permitted under the stockholm convention which prohibits its agricultural use,complex
one problem with all forms of irs is insecticide resistance,complex
mosquitoes affected by irs tend to rest and live indoors and due to the irritation caused by spraying their descendants tend to rest and live outdoors meaning that they are less affected by the irs,complex
there are a number of other methods to reduce mosquito bites and slow the spread of malaria,complex
efforts to decrease mosquito larva by decreasing the availability of open water in which they develop or by adding substances to decrease their development is effective in some locations,complex
electronic mosquito repellent devices which make very high-frequency sounds that are supposed to keep female mosquitoes away do not have supporting evidence,complex
community participation and health education strategies promoting awareness of malaria and the importance of control measures have been successfully used to reduce the incidence of malaria in some areas of the developing world,complex
recognizing the disease in the early stages can prevent the disease from becoming fatal,complex
education can also inform people to cover over areas of stagnant still water such as water tanks that are ideal breeding grounds for the parasite and mosquito thus cutting down the risk of the transmission between people,complex
this is generally used in urban areas where there are large centers of population in a confined space and transmission would be most likely in these areas,complex
intermittent preventive therapy is another intervention that has been used successfully to control malaria in pregnant women and infants and in preschool children where transmission is seasonal,complex
there are a number of medications that can help prevent or interrupt malaria in travelers to places where infection is common,complex
many of these medications are also used in treatment,complex
in places where plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications three medications—mefloquine doxycycline or the combination of atovaquone/proguanil malarone—are frequently used for prevention,complex
doxycycline and the atovaquone/proguanil are better tolerated while mefloquine is taken once a week,complex
areas of the world with chloroquine sensitive malaria are uncommon,complex
the protective effect does not begin immediately and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving except for atovaquone/proguanil which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward,complex
the use of preventative drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists and their use is usually only in pregnant women and short-term visitors,complex
this is due to the cost of the drugs side effects from long-term use and the difficulty in obtaining anti-malarial drugs outside of wealthy nations,complex
during pregnancy medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anemia in the mother,complex
the use of preventative drugs where malaria-bearing mosquitoes are present may encourage the development of partial resistance,complex
malaria is treated with antimalarial medications the ones used depends on the type and severity of the disease,complex
while medications against fever are commonly used their effects on outcomes are not clear,complex
simple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications,complex
the most effective treatment for p,complex
falciparum infection is the use of artemisinins in combination with other antimalarials known as artemisinin-combination therapy or act which decreases resistance to any single drug component,complex
these additional antimalarials include : amodiaquine lumefantrine mefloquine or sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine,complex
another recommended combination is dihydroartemisinin and piperaquine,complex
the meaning of health has evolved over time,complex
in keeping with the biomedical perspective early definitions of health focused on the theme of the body 's ability to function health was seen as a state of normal function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease,complex
an example of such a definition of health is : a state characterized by anatomic physiologic and psychological integrity ability to perform personally valued family work and community roles ability to deal with physical biological psychological and social stress,complex
then in in a radical departure from previous definitions the world health organization who proposed a definition that aimed higher : linking health to well-being in terms of physical mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity,complex
although this definition was welcomed by some as being innovative it was also criticized as being vague excessively broad and was not construed as measurable,complex
for a long time it was set aside as an impractical ideal and most discussions of health returned to the practicality of the biomedical model,complex
just as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of it as a process the same shift happened in definitions of health,complex
again the who played a leading role when it fostered the development of the health promotion movement in the s,complex
this brought in a new conception of health not as a state but in dynamic terms of resiliency in other words as a resource for living,complex
who revised the definition of health defined it as the extent to which an individual or group is able to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the environment,complex
health is a resource for everyday life not the objective of living it is a positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources as well as physical capacities,complex
thus health referred to the ability to maintain homeostasis and recover from insults,complex
mental intellectual emotional and social health referred to a person 's ability to handle stress to acquire skills to maintain relationships all of which form resources for resiliency and independent living,complex
this opens up many possibilities for health to be taught strengthened and learned,complex
since the late s the federal healthy people initiative has been a visible component of the united states ’ approach to improving population health,complex
in each decade a new version of healthy people is issued featuring updated goals and identifying topic areas and quantifiable objectives for health improvement during the succeeding ten years with assessment at that point of progress or lack thereof,complex
progress has been limited to many objectives leading to concerns about the effectiveness of healthy people in shaping outcomes in the context of a decentralized and uncoordinated us health system,complex
healthy people gives more prominence to health promotion and preventive approaches and adds a substantive focus on the importance of addressing social determinants of health,complex
a new expanded digital interface facilitates use and dissemination rather than bulky printed books as produced in the past,complex
the impact of these changes to healthy people will be determined in the coming years,complex
systematic activities to prevent or cure health problems and promote good health in humans are undertaken by health care providers,complex
applications with regard to animal health are covered by the veterinary sciences,complex
the term healthy is also widely used in the context of many types of non-living organizations and their impacts for the benefit of humans such as in the sense of healthy communities healthy cities or healthy environments,complex
the word insect comes from the latin word insectum meaning with a notched or divided body or literally cut into from the neuter singular perfect passive participle of insectare to cut into to cut up from in- into and secare to cut because insects appear cut into three sections,complex
a calque of greek ἔντομον [ éntomon ] cut into sections pliny the elder introduced the latin designation as a loan-translation of the greek word ἔντομος éntomos or insect as in entomology which was aristotle 's term for this class of life also in reference to their notched bodies,complex
insect first appears documented in english in in holland 's translation of pliny,complex
translations of aristotle 's term also form the usual word for insect in welsh trychfil from trychu to cut and mil animal serbo-croatian zareznik from rezati to cut russian насекомое nasekomoje from seč'/-sekat ' to cut etc,complex
the precise definition of the taxon insecta and the equivalent english name insect varies three alternative definitions are shown in the table,complex
in the broadest circumscription insecta sensu lato consists of all hexapods,complex
traditionally insects defined in this way were divided into apterygota the first five groups in the table – the wingless insects – and pterygota – the winged insects,complex
however modern phylogenetic studies have shown that apterygota is not monophyletic and so does not form a good taxon,complex
a narrower circumscription restricts insects to those hexapods with external mouthparts and comprises only the last three groups in the table,complex
in this sense insecta sensu stricto is equivalent to ectognatha,complex
in the narrowest circumscription insects are restricted to hexapods that are either winged or descended from winged ancestors,complex
insecta sensu strictissimo is then equivalent to pterygota,complex
for the purposes of this article the middle definition is used insects consist of two wingless taxa archaeognatha jumping bristletails and zygentoma silverfish plus the winged or secondarily wingless pterygota,complex
the evolutionary relationship of insects to other animal groups remains unclear,complex
although traditionally grouped with millipedes and centipedes—possibly on the basis of convergent adaptations to terrestrialisation—evidence has emerged favoring closer evolutionary ties with crustaceans,complex
in the pancrustacea theory insects together with entognatha remipedia and cephalocarida make up a natural clade labeled miracrustacea,complex
insects form a single clade closely related to crustaceans and myriapods,complex
other terrestrial arthropods such as centipedes millipedes scorpions and spiders are sometimes confused with insects since their body plans can appear similar sharing as do all arthropods a jointed exoskeleton,complex
however upon closer examination their features differ significantly most noticeably they do not have the six-legged characteristic of adult insects,complex
the higher-level phylogeny of the arthropods continues to be a matter of debate and research,complex
in researchers at tufts university uncovered what they believe is the world 's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect a -million-year-old specimen from the carboniferous period,complex
the oldest definitive insect fossil is the devonian rhyniognatha hirsti from the -million-year-old rhynie chert,complex
it may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect,complex
this species already possessed dicondylic mandibles two articulations in the mandible a feature associated with winged insects suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time,complex
thus the first insects probably appeared earlier in the silurian period,complex
four super radiations of insects have occurred : beetles evolved about million years ago flies evolved about million years ago and moths and wasps evolved about million years ago,complex
these four groups account for the majority of described species,complex
the flies and moths along with the fleas evolved from the mecoptera,complex
the origins of insect flight remain obscure since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers,complex
some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax for a total of three pairs,complex
as of no evidence suggests the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved to have wings,complex
late carboniferous and early permian insect orders include both extant groups their stem groups and a number of paleozoic groups now extinct,complex
during this era some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of to cm to in making them far larger than any living insect,complex
this gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today,complex
the lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor,complex
most extinct orders of insects developed during the permian period that began around million years ago,complex
many of the early groups became extinct during the permian-triassic extinction event the largest mass extinction in the history of the earth around million years ago,complex
the remarkably successful hymenoptera appeared as long as million years ago in the cretaceous period but achieved their wide diversity more recently in the cenozoic era which began million years ago,complex
a number of highly successful insect groups evolved in conjunction with flowering plants a powerful illustration of coevolution,complex
many modern insect genera developed during the cenozoic,complex
insects from this period on are often found preserved in amber often in perfect condition,complex
the body plan or morphology of such specimens is thus easily compared with modern species,complex
the study of fossilized insects is called paleoentomology,complex
insects are prey for a variety of organisms including terrestrial vertebrates,complex
the earliest vertebrates on land existed million years ago and were large amphibious piscivores,complex
through gradual evolutionary change insectivory was the next diet type to evolve,complex
insects were among the earliest terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants,complex
plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects in turn evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins,complex
many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators,complex
such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors,complex
this successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics,complex
over time this has led to complex groups of coevolved species,complex
conversely some interactions between plants and insects like pollination are beneficial to both organisms,complex
coevolution has led to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems,complex
traditional morphology-based or appearance-based systematics have usually given the hexapoda the rank of superclass and identified four groups within it : insects ectognatha springtails collembola protura and diplura the latter three being grouped together as the entognatha on the basis of internalized mouth parts,complex
supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data,complex
a recent theory is that the hexapoda are polyphyletic where the last common ancestor was not a member of the group with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the insecta,complex
many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic so rather than using ranks like subclass superorder and infraorder it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group,complex
the following represents the best-supported monophyletic groupings for the insecta,complex
insects can be divided into two groups historically treated as subclasses : wingless insects known as apterygota and winged insects known as pterygota,complex
the apterygota consist of the primitively wingless order of the silverfish zygentoma,complex
archaeognatha make up the monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles while zygentoma and pterygota are grouped together as dicondylia,complex
the zygentoma themselves possibly are not monophyletic with the family lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the dicondylia pterygota and the remaining zygentoma,complex
paleoptera and neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called sclerites and in the neoptera muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen,complex
neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based polyneoptera and paraneoptera and complete metamorphosis-based groups,complex
it has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa,complex
for example the paraneoptera have turned out to be more closely related to the endopterygota than to the rest of the exopterygota,complex
the recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders mallophaga and anoplura are derived from within psocoptera has led to the new taxon psocodea,complex
phasmatodea and embiidina have been suggested to form the eukinolabia,complex
mantodea blattodea and isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed dictyoptera,complex
the exopterygota likely are paraphyletic in regard to the endopterygota,complex
matters that have incurred controversy include strepsiptera and diptera grouped together as halteria based on a reduction of one of the wing pairs – a position not well-supported in the entomological community,complex
the neuropterida are often lumped or split on the whims of the taxonomist,complex
fleas are now thought to be closely related to boreid mecopterans,complex
many questions remain in the basal relationships among endopterygote orders particularly the hymenoptera,complex
the study of the classification or taxonomy of any insect is called systematic entomology,complex
if one works with a more specific order or even a family the term may also be made specific to that order or family for example systematic dipterology,complex
though the true dimensions of species diversity remain uncertain estimates range from,complex
–,complex
million species with a mean of,complex
million,complex
between – of all described species are insects so over of all described eukaryotes,complex
million are insects see illustration,complex
with only known non-insects if the actual number of insects is,complex

of the orders of insects four dominate in terms of numbers of described species with at least species included in coleoptera diptera hymenoptera and lepidoptera,complex
a study estimated the number of beetle species at,complex

insects have segmented bodies supported by exoskeletons the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin,complex
the segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units or tagmata : a head a thorax and an abdomen,complex
the head supports a pair of sensory antennae a pair of compound eyes zero to three simple eyes or ocelli and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts,complex
the thorax is made up of three segments : the prothorax mesothorax and the metathorax,complex
each thoracic segment supports one pair of legs,complex
the meso- and metathoracic segments may each have a pair of wings depending on the insect,complex
the abdomen consists of eleven segments though in a few species of insects these segments may be fused together or reduced in size,complex
the abdomen also contains most of the digestive respiratory excretory and reproductive internal structures,complex
considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur especially wings legs antenna and mouthparts,complex
the head is enclosed in a hard heavily sclerotized unsegmented exoskeletal head capsule or epicranium which contains most of the sensing organs including the antennae ocellus or eyes and the mouthparts,complex
of all the insect orders orthoptera displays the most features found in other insects including the sutures and sclerites,complex
here the vertex or the apex dorsal region is situated between the compound eyes for insects with a hypognathous and opisthognathous head,complex
in prognathous insects the vertex is not found between the compound eyes but rather where the ocelli are normally,complex
this is because the primary axis of the head is rotated ° to become parallel to the primary axis of the body,complex
in some species this region is modified and assumes a different name,complex
the thorax is a tagma composed of three sections the prothorax mesothorax and the metathorax,complex
the anterior segment closest to the head is the prothorax with the major features being the first pair of legs and the pronotum,complex
the middle segment is the mesothorax with the major features being the second pair of legs and the anterior wings,complex
the third and most posterior segment abutting the abdomen is the metathorax which features the third pair of legs and the posterior wings,complex
each segment is dilineated by an intersegmental suture,complex
each segment has four basic regions,complex
the dorsal surface is called the tergum or notum to distinguish it from the abdominal terga,complex
the two lateral regions are called the pleura singular : pleuron and the ventral aspect is called the sternum,complex
the first classification of birds was developed by francis willughby and john ray in their volume ornithologiae,complex
carl linnaeus modified that work in to devise the taxonomic classification system currently in use,complex
birds are categorised as the biological class aves in linnaean taxonomy,complex
phylogenetic taxonomy places aves in the dinosaur clade theropoda,complex
aves and a sister group the clade crocodilia contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade archosauria,complex
during the late s aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and archaeopteryx lithographica,complex
however an earlier definition proposed by jacques gauthier gained wide currency in the st century and is used by many scientists including adherents of the phylocode system,complex
gauthier defined aves to include only the crown group of the set of modern birds,complex
this was done by excluding most groups known only from fossils and assigning them instead to the avialae in part to avoid the uncertainties about the placement of archaeopteryx in relation to animals traditionally thought of as theropod dinosaurs,complex
gauthier identified four different definitions for the same biological name aves which is a problem,complex
gauthier proposed to reserve the term aves only for the crown group consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants which corresponds to meaning number below,complex
he assigned other names to the other groups,complex
aves can mean all archosaurs closer to birds than to crocodiles alternately avemetatarsalia aves can mean those advanced archosaurs with feathers alternately avifilopluma aves can mean those feathered dinosaurs that fly alternately avialae aves can mean the last common ancestor of all the currently living birds and all of its descendants a crown group in this sense synonymous with neornithesunder the fourth definition archaeopteryx is an avialan and not a member of aves,complex
gauthier 's proposals have been adopted by many researchers in the field of palaeontology and bird evolution though the exact definitions applied have been inconsistent,complex
avialae initially proposed to replace the traditional fossil content of aves is often used synonymously with the vernacular term bird by these researchers,complex
most researchers define avialae as branch-based clade though definitions vary,complex
many authors have used a definition similar to all theropods closer to birds than to deinonychus,complex
avialae is also occasionally defined as an apomorphy-based clade that is one based on physical characteristics,complex
jacques gauthier who named avialae in re-defined it in as all dinosaurs that possessed feathered wings used in flapping flight and the birds that descended from them,complex
based on fossil and biological evidence most scientists accept that birds are a specialised subgroup of theropod dinosaurs and more specifically they are members of maniraptora a group of theropods which includes dromaeosaurs and oviraptorids among others,complex
as scientists have discovered more theropods closely related to birds the previously clear distinction between non-birds and birds has become blurred,complex
recent discoveries in the liaoning province of northeast china which demonstrate many small theropod feathered dinosaurs contribute to this ambiguity,complex
the consensus view in contemporary palaeontology is that the flying theropods or avialans are the closest relatives of the deinonychosaurs which include dromaeosaurids and troodontids,complex
together these form a group called paraves,complex
some basal members of this group such as microraptor have features which may have enabled them to glide or fly,complex
the most basal deinonychosaurs were very small,complex
this evidence raises the possibility that the ancestor of all paravians may have been arboreal have been able to glide or both,complex
unlike archaeopteryx and the non-avialan feathered dinosaurs who primarily ate meat recent studies suggest that the first avialans were omnivores,complex
the late jurassic archaeopteryx is well known as one of the first transitional fossils to be found and it provided support for the theory of evolution in the late th century,complex
archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics : teeth clawed fingers and a long lizard-like tail as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds,complex
it is not considered a direct ancestor of birds though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor,complex
the earliest known avialan fossils come from the tiaojishan formation of china which has been dated to the late jurassic period oxfordian stage about million years ago,complex
the avialan species from this time period include anchiornis huxleyi xiaotingia zhengi and aurornis xui,complex
the well-known early avialan archaeopteryx dates from slightly later jurassic rocks about million years old from germany,complex
many of these early avialans shared unusual anatomical features that may be ancestral to modern birds but were later lost during bird evolution,complex
these features include enlarged claws on the second toe which may have been held clear of the ground in life and long feathers or hind wings covering the hind limbs and feet which may have been used in aerial maneuvering,complex
avialans diversified into a wide variety of forms during the cretaceous period,complex
many groups retained primitive characteristics such as clawed wings and teeth though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups including modern birds aves,complex
while the earliest forms such as archaeopteryx and jeholornis retained the long bony tails of their ancestors the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened with the advent of the pygostyle bone in the group pygostylia,complex
in the late cretaceous about million years ago the ancestors of all modern birds evolved a more open pelvis allowing them to lay larger eggs compared to body size,complex
around million years ago they evolved a better sense of smell,complex
the first large diverse lineage of short-tailed avialans to evolve were the enantiornithes or opposite birds so named because the construction of their shoulder bones was in reverse to that of modern birds,complex
enantiornithes occupied a wide array of ecological niches from sand-probing shorebirds and fish-eaters to tree-dwelling forms and seed-eaters,complex
while they were the dominant group of avialans during the cretaceous period enantiornithes became extinct along with many other dinosaur groups at the end of the mesozoic era,complex
many species of the second major avialan lineage to diversify the euornithes meaning true birds because they include the ancestors of modern birds were semi-aquatic and specialised in eating fish and other small aquatic organisms,complex
unlike the enantiornithes which dominated land-based and arboreal habitats most early euornithes lacked perching adaptations and seem to have included shorebird-like species waders and swimming and diving species,complex
the latter included the superficially gull-like ichthyornis the hesperornithiformes which became so well adapted to hunting fish in marine environments that they lost the ability to fly and became primarily aquatic,complex
the early euornithes also saw the development of many traits associated with modern birds like strongly keeled breastbones toothless beaked portions of their jaws though most non-avian euornithes retained teeth in other parts of the jaws,complex
euornithes also included the first avialans to develop true pygostyle and a fully mobile fan of tail feathers which may have replaced the hind wing as the primary mode of aerial maneuverability and braking in flight,complex
a study on mosaic evolution in the avian skull found that the last common ancestor of all neornithines might have had a beak similar to that of the modern hook-billed vanga and a skull similar to that of the eurasian golden oriole,complex
as both species are small aerial and canopy foraging omnivores a similar ecological niche was inferred for this hypothetical ancestor,complex
all modern birds lie within the crown group aves alternately neornithes which has two subdivisions : the palaeognathae which includes the flightless ratites such as the ostriches and the weak-flying tinamous and the extremely diverse neognathae containing all other birds,complex
these two subdivisions are often given the rank of superorder although livezey and zusi assigned them cohort rank,complex
depending on the taxonomic viewpoint the number of known living bird species varies anywhere from to,complex
the discovery of vegavis a late cretaceous member of the anatidae proved that the diversification of modern birds started before the cenozoic,complex
the affinities of an earlier fossil the possible galliform austinornis lentus dated to about million years ago are still too controversial to provide a fossil evidence of modern bird diversification,complex
most studies agree on a cretaceous age for the most recent common ancestor of modern birds but estimates range from the middle cretaceous to the latest late cretaceous,complex
similarly there is no agreement on whether most of the early diversification of modern birds occurred before or after the cretaceous–palaeogene extinction event,complex
this disagreement is in part caused by a divergence in the evidence most molecular dating studies suggests a cretaceous radiation while fossil evidence points to a cenozoic radiation the so-called 'rocks ' versus 'clocks ' controversy,complex
previous attempts to reconcile molecular and fossil evidence have proved controversial but more recent estimates using a more comprehensive sample of fossils and a new way of calibrating molecular clocks showed that while modern birds originated early in the late cretaceous a pulse of diversification in all major groups occurred around the cretaceous–palaeogene extinction event,complex

the classification of birds is a contentious issue,complex
sibley and ahlquist 's phylogeny and classification of birds is a landmark work on the classification of birds although it is frequently debated and constantly revised,complex
most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate but scientists disagree about the relationships between the orders themselves evidence from modern bird anatomy fossils and dna have all been brought to bear on the problem but no strong consensus has emerged,complex
more recently new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders,complex
birds live and breed in most terrestrial habitats and on all seven continents reaching their southern extreme in the snow petrel 's breeding colonies up to kilometres mi inland in antarctica,complex
the highest bird diversity occurs in tropical regions,complex
it was earlier thought that this high diversity was the result of higher speciation rates in the tropics however recent studies found higher speciation rates in the high latitudes that were offset by greater extinction rates than in the tropics,complex
several families of birds have adapted to life both on the world 's oceans and in them with some seabird species coming ashore only to breed and some penguins have been recorded diving up to metres ft deep,complex
many bird species have established breeding populations in areas to which they have been introduced by humans,complex
some of these introductions have been deliberate the ring-necked pheasant for example has been introduced around the world as a game bird,complex
others have been accidental such as the establishment of wild monk parakeets in several north american cities after their escape from captivity,complex
some species including cattle egret yellow-headed caracara and galah have spread naturally far beyond their original ranges as agricultural practices created suitable new habitat,complex
compared with other vertebrates birds have a body plan that shows many unusual adaptations mostly to facilitate flight,complex
the skeleton consists of very lightweight bones,complex
they have large air-filled cavities called pneumatic cavities which connect with the respiratory system,complex
the skull bones in adults are fused and do not show cranial sutures,complex
the orbits are large and separated by a bony septum,complex
the spine has cervical thoracic lumbar and caudal regions with the number of cervical neck vertebrae highly variable and especially flexible but movement is reduced in the anterior thoracic vertebrae and absent in the later vertebrae,complex
the last few are fused with the pelvis to form the synsacrum,complex
the ribs are flattened and the sternum is keeled for the attachment of flight muscles except in the flightless bird orders,complex
the forelimbs are modified into wings,complex
like the reptiles birds are primarily uricotelic that is their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine,complex
birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and with exception of the ostrich uric acid is excreted along with faeces as a semisolid waste,complex
however birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia,complex
they also excrete creatine rather than creatinine like mammals,complex
this material as well as the output of the intestines emerges from the bird 's cloaca,complex
the cloaca is a multi-purpose opening : waste is expelled through it most birds mate by joining cloaca and females lay eggs from it,complex
in addition many species of birds regurgitate pellets,complex
males within palaeognathae with the exception of the kiwis the anseriformes with the exception of screamers and in rudimentary forms in galliformes but fully developed in cracidae possess a penis which is never present in neoaves,complex
the length is thought to be related to sperm competition,complex
when not copulating it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca just inside the vent,complex
the digestive system of birds is unique with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth,complex
most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight,complex
some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies including protein from the intestines as additional energy during migration,complex
birds have one of the most complex respiratory systems of all animal groups,complex
upon inhalation of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air,complex
the other of the air goes directly into the lungs,complex
when the bird exhales the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs,complex
thus a bird 's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation,complex
sound production is achieved using the syrinx a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from the lower end of the trachea the trachea being elongated in some species increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird 's size,complex
in birds the main arteries taking blood away from the heart originate from the right aortic arch or pharyngeal arch unlike in the mammals where the left aortic arch forms this part of the aorta,complex
the postcava receives blood from the limbs via the renal portal system,complex
unlike in mammals the circulating red blood cells in birds retain their nucleus,complex
the avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac,complex
this pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication,complex
the heart itself is divided into a right and left half each with an atrium and ventricle,complex
the atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction,complex
being myogenic the heart 's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node located on the right atrium,complex
the sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarising signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles,complex
the avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers,complex
much like a mammalian heart the avian heart is composed of endocardial myocardial and epicardial layers,complex
the atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body,complex
avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass,complex
this adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight,complex
birds have a very efficient system for diffusing oxygen into the blood birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals,complex
as a result birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal,complex
the arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand the pressure of the ventricular constriction and become more rigid as they move away from the heart,complex
blood moves through the arteries which undergo vasoconstriction and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body,complex
as the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow,complex
blood travels through the arterioles and moves into the capillaries where gas exchange can occur,complex
capillaries are organized into capillary beds in tissues it is here that blood exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide waste,complex
in the capillary beds blood flow is slowed to allow maximum diffusion of oxygen into the tissues,complex
once the blood has become deoxygenated it travels through venules then veins and back to the heart,complex
veins unlike arteries are thin and rigid as they do not need to withstand extreme pressure,complex
as blood travels through the venules to the veins a funneling occurs called vasodilation bringing blood back to the heart,complex
once the blood reaches the heart it moves first into the right atrium then the right ventricle to be pumped through the lungs for further gas exchange of carbon dioxide waste for oxygen,complex
oxygenated blood then flows from the lungs through the left atrium to the left ventricle where it is pumped out to the body,complex
the nervous system is large relative to the bird 's size,complex
the most developed part of the brain is the one that controls the flight-related functions while the cerebellum coordinates movement and the cerebrum controls behaviour patterns navigation mating and nest building,complex
most birds have a poor sense of smell with notable exceptions including kiwis new world vultures and tubenoses,complex
the avian visual system is usually highly developed,complex
water birds have special flexible lenses allowing accommodation for vision in air and water,complex
some species also have dual fovea,complex
birds are tetrachromatic possessing ultraviolet uv sensitive cone cells in the eye as well as green red and blue ones,complex
they also have double cones likely to mediate achromatic vision,complex
many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers,complex
male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers,complex
ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the uv reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents,complex
with the exception of pigeons and a few other species the eyelids of birds are not used in blinking,complex
instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane a third eyelid that moves horizontally,complex
the nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds,complex
the bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten,complex
most birds can not move their eyes although there are exceptions such as the great cormorant,complex
birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field while birds with eyes on the front of their heads such as owls have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field,complex
the avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers although in some birds such as the asio bubo and otus owls these feathers form tufts which resemble ears,complex
the inner ear has a cochlea but it is not spiral as in mammals,complex
a few species are able to use chemical defences against predators some procellariiformes can eject an unpleasant stomach oil against an aggressor and some species of pitohuis from new guinea have a powerful neurotoxin in their skin and feathers,complex
a lack of field observations limit our knowledge but intraspecific conflicts are known to sometimes result in injury or death,complex
the screamers anhimidae some jacanas jacana hydrophasianus the spur-winged goose plectropterus the torrent duck merganetta and nine species of lapwing vanellus use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon,complex
the steamer ducks tachyeres geese and swans anserinae the solitaire pezophaps sheathbills chionis some guans crax and stone curlews burhinus use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents,complex
the jacanas actophilornis and irediparra have an expanded blade-like radius,complex
the extinct xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail,complex
swans for instance may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young,complex
birds have two sexes : either female or male,complex
the sex of birds is determined by the z and w sex chromosomes rather than by the x and y chromosomes present in mammals,complex
male birds have two z chromosomes zz and female birds have a w chromosome and a z chromosome wz,complex
in nearly all species of birds an individual 's sex is determined at fertilisation,complex
however one recent study demonstrated temperature-dependent sex determination among the australian brushturkey for which higher temperatures during incubation resulted in a higher female-to-male sex ratio,complex
this however was later proven to not be the case,complex
these birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination but temperature-dependent sex mortality,complex
feathers are a feature characteristic of birds though also present in some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds,complex
they facilitate flight provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation and are used in display camouflage and signalling,complex
there are several types of feathers each serving its own set of purposes,complex
feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae,complex
the distribution pattern of these feather tracts pterylosis is used in taxonomy and systematics,complex
the arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body called plumage may vary within species by age social status and sex,complex
plumage is regularly moulted the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the non-breeding plumage or—in the humphrey-parkes terminology—basic plumage breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the humphrey-parkes system as alternate plumages,complex
moulting is annual in most species although some may have two moults a year and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years,complex
moulting patterns vary across species,complex
in passerines flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first,complex
when the fifth of sixth primary is replaced the outermost tertiaries begin to drop,complex
after the innermost tertiaries are moulted the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers centrifugal moult,complex
the greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap,complex
a small number of species such as ducks and geese lose all of their flight feathers at once temporarily becoming flightless,complex
as a general rule the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair,complex
centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the phasianidae,complex
the centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail,complex
the general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward secondaries inward and the tail from centre outward,complex
before nesting the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly,complex
the skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation,complex
feathers require maintenance and birds preen or groom them daily spending an average of around of their daily time on this,complex
the bill is used to brush away foreign particles and to apply waxy secretions from the uropygial gland these secretions protect the feathers ' flexibility and act as an antimicrobial agent inhibiting the growth of feather-degrading bacteria,complex
this may be supplemented with the secretions of formic acid from ants which birds receive through a behaviour known as anting to remove feather parasites,complex
the scales of birds are composed of the same keratin as beaks claws and spurs,complex
they are found mainly on the toes and metatarsus but may be found further up on the ankle in some birds,complex
most bird scales do not overlap significantly except in the cases of kingfishers and woodpeckers,complex
the scales of birds are thought to be homologous to those of reptiles and mammals,complex
most birds can fly which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes,complex
flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators,complex
birds have various adaptations for flight including a lightweight skeleton two large flight muscles the pectoralis which accounts for of the total mass of the bird and the supracoracoideus as well as a modified forelimb wing that serves as an aerofoil,complex
wing shape and size generally determine a bird 's flight style and performance many birds combine powered flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight,complex
about extant bird species are flightless as were many extinct birds,complex
flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators,complex
although flightless penguins use similar musculature and movements to fly through the water as do auks shearwaters and dippers,complex
most birds are diurnal but some birds such as many species of owls and nightjars are nocturnal or crepuscular active during twilight hours and many coastal waders feed when the tides are appropriate by day or night,complex
birds ' diets are varied and often include nectar fruit plants seeds carrion and various small animals including other birds,complex
because birds have no teeth their digestive system is adapted to process unmasticated food items that are swallowed whole,complex
birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists,complex
birds ' feeding strategies vary by species,complex
many birds glean for insects invertebrates fruit or seeds,complex
some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch,complex
those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents ' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes,complex
combined insectivorous birds eat – million metric tons of arthropods annually,complex
nectar feeders such as hummingbirds sunbirds lories and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers,complex
kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates shorebirds ' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches,complex
loons diving ducks penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater using their wings or feet for propulsion while aerial predators such as sulids kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey,complex
flamingos three species of prion and some ducks are filter feeders,complex
geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers,complex
some species including frigatebirds gulls and skuas engage in kleptoparasitism stealing food items from other birds,complex
kleptoparasitism is thought to be a supplement to food obtained by hunting rather than a significant part of any species ' diet a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds stole at most of their food and on average stole only,complex
other birds are scavengers some of these like vultures are specialised carrion eaters while others like gulls corvids or other birds of prey are opportunists,complex
water is needed by many birds although their mode of excretion and lack of sweat glands reduces the physiological demands,complex
some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food,complex
they may also have other adaptations such as allowing their body temperature to rise saving on moisture loss from evaporative cooling or panting,complex
seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils,complex
most birds scoop water in their beaks and raise their head to let water run down the throat,complex
some species especially of arid zones belonging to the pigeon finch mousebird button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads,complex
some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes,complex
nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers,complex
some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food,complex
the pigeon family flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks,complex
feathers being critical to the survival of a bird require maintenance,complex
apart from physical wear and tear feathers face the onslaught of fungi ectoparasitic feather mites and birdlice,complex
the physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland,complex
birds also bathe in water or dust themselves,complex
while some birds dip into shallow water more aerial species may make aerial dips into water and arboreal species often make use of dew or rain that collect on leaves,complex
birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust-bathe,complex
a behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers,complex
many species will spread out their wings and expose them to direct sunlight and this too is thought to help in reducing fungal and ectoparasitic activity that may lead to feather damage,complex
many bird species migrate to take advantage of global differences of seasonal temperatures therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat,complex
these migrations vary among the different groups,complex
many landbirds shorebirds and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions,complex
these birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere,complex
before migration birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs,complex
migration is highly demanding energetically particularly as birds need to cross deserts and oceans without refuelling,complex
landbirds have a flight range of around km mi and shorebirds can fly up to km mi although the bar-tailed godwit is capable of non-stop flights of up to km mi,complex
seabirds also undertake long migrations the longest annual migration being those of sooty shearwaters which nest in new zealand and chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the north pacific off japan alaska and california an annual round trip of km mi,complex
other seabirds disperse after breeding travelling widely but having no set migration route,complex
albatrosses nesting in the southern ocean often undertake circumpolar trips between breeding seasons,complex
some bird species undertake shorter migrations travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food,complex
irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next,complex
this type of migration is normally associated with food availability,complex
species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics others undertake partial migrations where only a fraction of the population usually females and subdominant males migrates,complex
partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions in australia surveys found that of non-passerine birds and of passerines were partially migratory,complex
altitudinal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions,complex
it is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food,complex
some species may also be nomadic holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability,complex
parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive irruptive nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations,complex
the ability of birds to return to precise locations across vast distances has been known for some time in an experiment conducted in the s a manx shearwater released in boston in the united states returned to its colony in skomer in wales within days a distance of km mi,complex
birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods,complex
for diurnal migrants the sun is used to navigate by day and a stellar compass is used at night,complex
birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock,complex
orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding polaris,complex
these are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the earth 's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors,complex
birds communicate using primarily visual and auditory signals,complex
signals can be interspecific between species and intraspecific within species,complex
birds sometimes use plumage to assess and assert social dominance to display breeding condition in sexually selected species or to make threatening displays as in the sunbittern 's mimicry of a large predator to ward off hawks and protect young chicks,complex
variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds particularly between species,complex
visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening the adjustments of feather position pecking or other behaviour,complex
these displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds,complex
the most elaborate displays occur during courtship where dances are often formed from complex combinations of many possible component movements males ' breeding success may depend on the quality of such displays,complex
bird calls and songs which are produced in the syrinx are the major means by which birds communicate with sound,complex
this communication can be very complex some species can operate the two sides of the syrinx independently allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs,complex
calls are used for a variety of purposes including mate attraction evaluation of potential mates bond formation the claiming and maintenance of territories the identification of other individuals such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season and the warning of other birds of potential predators sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat,complex
some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication,complex
the coenocorypha snipes of new zealand drive air through their feathers woodpeckers drum for long distance communication and palm cockatoos use tools to drum,complex
while some birds are essentially territorial or live in small family groups other birds may form large flocks,complex
the principal benefits of flocking are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency,complex
defence against predators is particularly important in closed habitats like forests where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system,complex
this has led to the development of many mixed-species feeding flocks which are usually composed of small numbers of many species these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources,complex
costs of flocking include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases,complex
birds sometimes also form associations with non-avian species,complex
plunge-diving seabirds associate with dolphins and tuna which push shoaling fish towards the surface,complex
hornbills have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses in which they forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators,complex
the high metabolic rates of birds during the active part of the day is supplemented by rest at other times,complex
sleeping birds often use a type of sleep known as vigilant sleep where periods of rest are interspersed with quick eye-opening peeks allowing them to be sensitive to disturbances and enable rapid escape from threats,complex
swifts are believed to be able to sleep in flight and radar observations suggest that they orient themselves to face the wind in their roosting flight,complex
it has been suggested that there may be certain kinds of sleep which are possible even when in flight,complex
some birds have also demonstrated the capacity to fall into slow-wave sleep one hemisphere of the brain at a time,complex
the birds tend to exercise this ability depending upon its position relative to the outside of the flock,complex
this may allow the eye opposite the sleeping hemisphere to remain vigilant for predators by viewing the outer margins of the flock,complex
this adaptation is also known from marine mammals,complex
communal roosting is common because it lowers the loss of body heat and decreases the risks associated with predators,complex
roosting sites are often chosen with regard to thermoregulation and safety,complex
many sleeping birds bend their heads over their backs and tuck their bills in their back feathers although others place their beaks among their breast feathers,complex
many birds rest on one leg while some may pull up their legs into their feathers especially in cold weather,complex
perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them hold on to the perch when they are asleep,complex
many ground birds such as quails and pheasants roost in trees,complex
a few parrots of the genus loriculus roost hanging upside down,complex
some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates,complex
this physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species including owlet-nightjars nightjars and woodswallows,complex
one species the common poorwill even enters a state of hibernation,complex
the word bacteria is the plural of the new latin bacterium which is the latinisation of the greek βακτήριον bakterion the diminutive of βακτηρία bakteria meaning staff cane because the first ones to be discovered were rod-shaped,complex
the ancestors of modern bacteria were unicellular microorganisms that were the first forms of life to appear on earth about billion years ago,complex
for about billion years most organisms were microscopic and bacteria and archaea were the dominant forms of life,complex
although bacterial fossils exist such as stromatolites their lack of distinctive morphology prevents them from being used to examine the history of bacterial evolution or to date the time of origin of a particular bacterial species,complex
however gene sequences can be used to reconstruct the bacterial phylogeny and these studies indicate that bacteria diverged first from the archaeal/eukaryotic lineage,complex
the most recent common ancestor of bacteria and archaea was probably a hyperthermophile that lived about,complex
billion–,complex
billion years ago,complex
bacteria were also involved in the second great evolutionary divergence that of the archaea and eukaryotes,complex
here eukaryotes resulted from the entering of ancient bacteria into endosymbiotic associations with the ancestors of eukaryotic cells which were themselves possibly related to the archaea,complex
this involved the engulfment by proto-eukaryotic cells of alphaproteobacterial symbionts to form either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes which are still found in all known eukarya sometimes in highly reduced form e,complex
g,complex
in ancient amitochondrial protozoa,complex
later some eukaryotes that already contained mitochondria also engulfed cyanobacteria-like organisms leading to the formation of chloroplasts in algae and plants,complex
this is known as secondary endosymbiosis,complex
bacteria display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes called morphologies,complex
bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically,complex
–,complex
micrometres in length,complex
however a few species are visible to the unaided eye—for example thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches,complex
the english word fungus is directly adopted from the latin fungus mushroom used in the writings of horace and pliny,complex
this in turn is derived from the greek word sphongos σφόγγος sponge which refers to the macroscopic structures and morphology of mushrooms and molds the root is also used in other languages such as the german schwamm sponge and schimmel mold,complex
the use of the word mycology which is derived from the greek mykes μύκης mushroom and logos λόγος discourse to denote the scientific study of fungi is thought to have originated in with english naturalist miles joseph berkeley 's publication the english flora of sir james edward smith vol,complex
,complex
a group of all the fungi present in a particular area or geographic region is known as mycobiota plural noun no singular e,complex

the mycobiota of ireland,complex
before the introduction of molecular methods for phylogenetic analysis taxonomists considered fungi to be members of the plant kingdom because of similarities in lifestyle : both fungi and plants are mainly immobile and have similarities in general morphology and growth habitat,complex
like plants fungi often grow in soil and in the case of mushrooms form conspicuous fruit bodies which sometimes resemble plants such as mosses,complex
the fungi are now considered a separate kingdom distinct from both plants and animals from which they appear to have diverged around one billion years ago around the start of the neoproterozoic era,complex
some morphological biochemical and genetic features are shared with other organisms while others are unique to the fungi clearly separating them from the other kingdoms : shared features : with other eukaryotes : fungal cells contain membrane-bound nuclei with chromosomes that contain dna with noncoding regions called introns and coding regions called exons,complex
fungi have membrane-bound cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria sterol-containing membranes and ribosomes of the s type,complex
they have a characteristic range of soluble carbohydrates and storage compounds including sugar alcohols e,complex

mannitol disaccharides e,complex

trehalose and polysaccharides e,complex

glycogen which is also found in animals,complex
with animals : fungi lack chloroplasts and are heterotrophic organisms and so require preformed organic compounds as energy sources,complex
with plants : fungi have a cell wall and vacuoles,complex
they reproduce by both sexual and asexual means and like basal plant groups such as ferns and mosses produce spores,complex
similar to mosses and algae fungi typically have haploid nuclei,complex
with euglenoids and bacteria : higher fungi euglenoids and some bacteria produce the amino acid l-lysine in specific biosynthesis steps called the α-aminoadipate pathway,complex
the cells of most fungi grow as tubular elongated and thread-like filamentous structures called hyphae which may contain multiple nuclei and extend by growing at their tips,complex
each tip contains a set of aggregated vesicles—cellular structures consisting of proteins lipids and other organic molecules—called the spitzenkörper,complex
both fungi and oomycetes grow as filamentous hyphal cells,complex
in contrast similar-looking organisms such as filamentous green algae grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells,complex
there are also single-celled fungi yeasts that do not form hyphae and some fungi have both hyphal and yeast forms,complex
in common with some plant and animal species more than fungal species display bioluminescence,complex
unique features : some species grow as unicellular yeasts that reproduce by budding or binary fission,complex
dimorphic fungi can switch between a yeast phase and a hyphal phase in response to environmental conditions,complex
the fungal cell wall is composed of glucans and chitin while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods fungi are the only organisms that combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall,complex
unlike those of plants and oomycetes fungal cell walls do not contain cellulose,complex
the word chemistry comes from alchemy which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry metallurgy philosophy astrology astronomy mysticism and medicine,complex
it is often seen as linked to the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold though in ancient times the study encompassed many of the questions of modern chemistry being defined as the study of the composition of waters movement growth embodying disembodying drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies by the early th century greek-egyptian alchemist zosimos,complex
an alchemist was called a 'chemist ' in popular speech and later the suffix -ry was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as chemistry,complex
the modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the arabic word al-kīmīā الكیمیاء,complex
in origin the term is borrowed from the greek χημία or χημεία,complex
this may have egyptian origins since al-kīmīā is derived from the greek χημία which is in turn derived from the word kemet which is the ancient name of egypt in the egyptian language,complex
alternately al-kīmīā may derive from χημεία meaning cast together,complex
the current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model,complex
traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles atoms molecules substances metals crystals and other aggregates of matter,complex
this matter can be studied in solid liquid or gas states in isolation or in combination,complex
the interactions reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together,complex
such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory,complex
the chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware,complex
however glassware is not central to chemistry and a great deal of experimental as well as applied/industrial chemistry is done without it,complex
a chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances,complex
the basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms,complex
it can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation which usually involves atoms as subjects,complex
the number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal,complex
when the number of atoms on either side is unequal the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay,complex
the type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules known as chemical laws,complex
energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies,complex
chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure phase as well as their chemical compositions,complex
they can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis e,complex
g,complex
spectroscopy and chromatography,complex
scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists,complex
most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines,complex
several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry some of them are :,complex
in chemistry matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume it takes up space and is made up of particles,complex
the particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest mass such as the photon,complex
matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances,complex
the atom is the basic unit of chemistry,complex
it consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud,complex
the nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons together called nucleons while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus,complex
in a neutral atom the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons,complex
the nucleus is dense the mass of a nucleon is appromixately times that of an electron yet the radius of an atom is about times that of its nucleus,complex
the atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element such as electronegativity ionization potential preferred oxidation states coordination number and preferred types of bonds to form e,complex
g,complex
metallic ionic covalent,complex
a chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms known as the atomic number and represented by the symbol z,complex
the mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus,complex
although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number they may not necessarily have the same mass number atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes,complex
for example all atoms with protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of or,complex
the standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic table which orders elements by atomic number,complex
the periodic table is arranged in groups or columns and periods or rows,complex
the periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends,complex
a compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element,complex
the properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements,complex
the standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac,complex
organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system,complex
the names for inorganic compounds are created according to the inorganic nomenclature system,complex
when a compound has more than one component then they are divided into two classes the electropositive and the electronegative components,complex
in addition the chemical abstracts service has devised a method to index chemical substances,complex
in this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its cas registry number,complex
a molecule is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties that is its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances,complex
however this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules which is not true of many substances see below,complex
molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by covalent bonds such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in lone pairs,complex
thus molecules exist as electrically neutral units unlike ions,complex
when this rule is broken giving the molecule a charge the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion,complex
however the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer,complex
charged polyatomic collections residing in solids for example common sulfate or nitrate ions are generally not considered molecules in chemistry,complex
some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons creating radicals,complex
most radicals are comparatively reactive but some such as nitric oxide no can be stable,complex
the inert or noble gas elements helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way,complex
identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water air and many organic compounds like alcohol sugar gasoline and the various pharmaceuticals,complex
however not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust mantle and core of the earth are chemical compounds without molecules,complex
these other types of substances such as ionic compounds and network solids are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se,complex
instead these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance,complex
examples of such substances are mineral salts such as table salt solids like carbon and diamond metals and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite,complex
one of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure,complex
while the structure of diatomic triatomic or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial linear angular pyramidal etc,complex
the structure of polyatomic molecules that are constituted of more than six atoms of several elements can be crucial for its chemical nature,complex
a chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties,complex
a collection of substances is called a mixture,complex
examples of mixtures are air and alloys,complex
the mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance also called chemical amount,complex
the mole is defined as the number of atoms found in exactly,complex
kilogram or grams of carbon- where the carbon- atoms are unbound at rest and in their ground state,complex
the number of entities per mole is known as the avogadro constant and is determined empirically to be approximately,complex
× mol−,complex
molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution and is commonly reported in mol/dm,complex
in addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications chemicals can exist in several phases,complex
for the most part the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications however some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties,complex
a phase is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties over a range of conditions such as pressure or temperature,complex
physical properties such as density and refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase,complex
the phase of matter is defined by the phase transition which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system instead of changing the bulk conditions,complex
sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary in this case the matter is considered to be in a supercritical state,complex
when three states meet based on the conditions it is known as a triple point and since this is invariant it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions,complex
the most familiar examples of phases are solids liquids and gases,complex
many substances exhibit multiple solid phases,complex
for example there are three phases of solid iron alpha gamma and delta that vary based on temperature and pressure,complex
a principal difference between solid phases is the crystal structure or arrangement of the atoms,complex
another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the aqueous phase which is the state of substances dissolved in aqueous solution that is in water,complex
less familiar phases include plasmas bose–einstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials,complex
while most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems which has received attention for its relevance to systems in biology,complex
atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another,complex
the lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium both created by big bang nucleosynthesis during the first minutes of the universe in a ratio of around : by mass or : by number of atoms along with tiny traces of the next two elements lithium and beryllium,complex
almost all other elements found in nature were made by various natural methods of nucleosynthesis,complex
on earth small amounts of new atoms are naturally produced in nucleogenic reactions or in cosmogenic processes such as cosmic ray spallation,complex
new atoms are also naturally produced on earth as radiogenic daughter isotopes of ongoing radioactive decay processes such as alpha decay beta decay spontaneous fission cluster decay and other rarer modes of decay,complex
of the naturally occurring elements those with atomic numbers through each have at least one stable isotope except for technetium element and promethium element which have no stable isotopes,complex
isotopes considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been observed,complex
elements with atomic numbers through are unstable to the point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected,complex
some of these elements notably bismuth atomic number thorium atomic number and uranium atomic number have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy metals before the formation of our solar system,complex
at over,complex
× years over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe bismuth- atomic number has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element and is almost always considered on par with the stable elements,complex
the very heaviest elements those beyond plutonium element undergo radioactive decay with half-lives so short that they are not found in nature and must be synthesized,complex
as of there are known elements in this context known means observed well enough even from just a few decay products to have been differentiated from other elements,complex
of these elements occur naturally on earth,complex
six of these occur in extreme trace quantities : technetium atomic number promethium number astatine number francium number neptunium number and plutonium number,complex
these elements have been detected in the universe at large in the spectra of stars and also supernovae where short-lived radioactive elements are newly being made,complex
the first elements have been detected directly on earth as primordial nuclides present from the formation of the solar system or as naturally occurring fission or transmutation products of uranium and thorium,complex
the remaining heavier elements not found today either on earth or in astronomical spectra have been produced artificially : these are all radioactive with very short half-lives if any atoms of these elements were present at the formation of earth they are extremely likely to the point of certainty to have already decayed and if present in novae have been in quantities too small to have been noted,complex
technetium was the first purportedly non-naturally occurring element synthesized in although trace amounts of technetium have since been found in nature and also the element may have been discovered naturally in,complex
this pattern of artificial production and later natural discovery has been repeated with several other radioactive naturally occurring rare elements,complex
list of the elements are available by name atomic number density melting point boiling point and by symbol as well as ionization energies of the elements,complex
the nuclides of stable and radioactive elements are also available as a list of nuclides sorted by length of half-life for those that are unstable,complex
one of the most convenient and certainly the most traditional presentation of the elements is in the form of the periodic table which groups together elements with similar chemical properties and usually also similar electronic structures,complex
the atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in each atom and defines the element,complex
for example all carbon atoms contain protons in their atomic nucleus so the atomic number of carbon is,complex
carbon atoms may have different numbers of neutrons atoms of the same element having different numbers of neutrons are known as isotopes of the element,complex
the number of protons in the atomic nucleus also determines its electric charge which in turn determines the number of electrons of the atom in its non-ionized state,complex
the electrons are placed into atomic orbitals that determine the atom 's various chemical properties,complex
the number of neutrons in a nucleus usually has very little effect on an element 's chemical properties except in the case of hydrogen and deuterium,complex
thus all carbon isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties because they all have six protons and six electrons even though carbon atoms may for example have or neutrons,complex
that is why the atomic number rather than mass number or atomic weight is considered the identifying characteristic of a chemical element,complex
the symbol for atomic number is z,complex
on earth the common weather phenomena include wind cloud rain snow fog and dust storms,complex
less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes typhoons and ice storms,complex
almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere the lower part of the atmosphere,complex
weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood,complex
weather occurs primarily due to air pressure temperature and moisture differences between one place to another,complex
these differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot which varies by latitude from the tropics,complex
in other words the farther from the tropics one lies the lower the sun angle is which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface,complex
the strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream,complex
weather systems in the mid-latitudes such as extratropical cyclones are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow see baroclinity,complex
weather systems in the tropics such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems are caused by different processes,complex
because the earth 's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year,complex
in june the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun so at any given northern hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in december see effect of sun angle on climate,complex
this effect causes seasons,complex
over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years changes in earth 's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the earth and influence long-term climate,complex
astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences,complex
early civilizations dating back to beyond bce such as the sumerians ancient egyptians and the indus valley civilization had a predictive knowledge and a basic understanding of the motions of the sun moon and stars,complex
the stars and planets were often worshipped believed to represent gods,complex
while the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky which however did not explain the positions of the planets,complex
according to asger aaboe the origins of western astronomy can be found in mesopotamia and all western efforts in the exact sciences are descended from late babylonian astronomy,complex
egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies while greek poet homer wrote of various celestial objects in his iliad and odyssey later greek astronomers provided names which are still used today for most constellations visible from the northern hemisphere,complex
natural philosophy has its origins in greece during the archaic period bce – bce when pre-socratic philosophers like thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause,complex
they proposed ideas verified by reason and observation and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment for example atomism was found to be correct approximately years after it was proposed by leucippus and his pupil democritus,complex
the western roman empire fell in the fifth century and this resulted in a decline in intellectual pursuits in the western part of europe,complex
by contrast the eastern roman empire also known as the byzantine empire resisted the attacks from the barbarians and continued to advance various fields of learning including physics,complex
in the sixth century isidore of miletus created an important compilation of archimedes ' works that are copied in the archimedes palimpsest,complex
in sixth century europe john philoponus a byzantine scholar questioned aristotle 's teaching of physics and noting its flaws,complex
he introduced the theory of impetus,complex
aristotle 's physics was not scrutinized until john philoponus appeared and unlike aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument philoponus relied on observation,complex
on aristotle 's physics john philoponus wrote : “ but this is completely erroneous and our view may be corroborated by actual observation more effectively than by any sort of verbal argument,complex
for if you let fall from the same height two weights of which one is many times as heavy as the other you will see that the ratio of the times required for the motion does not depend on the ratio of the weights but that the difference in time is a very small one,complex
and so if the difference in the weights is not considerable that is of one is let us say double the other there will be no difference or else an imperceptible difference in time though the difference in weight is by no means negligible with one body weighing twice as much as the other ” john philoponus ' criticism of aristotelian principles of physics served as an inspiration for galileo galilei ten centuries later during the scientific revolution,complex
galileo cited philoponus substantially in his works when arguing that aristotelian physics was flawed,complex
in the s jean buridan a teacher in the faculty of arts at the university of paris developed the concept of impetus,complex
it was a step toward the modern ideas of inertia and momentum,complex
islamic scholarship inherited aristotelian physics from the greeks and during the islamic golden age developed it further especially placing emphasis on observation and a priori reasoning developing early forms of the scientific method,complex
the most notable innovations were in the field of optics and vision which came from the works of many scientists like ibn sahl al-kindi ibn al-haytham al-farisi and avicenna,complex
the most notable work was the book of optics also known as kitāb al-manāẓir written by ibn al-haytham in which he conclusively disproved the ancient greek idea about vision but also came up with a new theory,complex
in the book he presented a study of the phenomenon of the camera obscura his thousand-year-old version of the pinhole camera and delved further into the way the eye itself works,complex
using dissections and the knowledge of previous scholars he was able to begin to explain how light enters the eye,complex
he asserted that the light ray is focused but the actual explanation of how light projected to the back of the eye had to wait until,complex
his treatise on light explained the camera obscura hundreds of years before the modern development of photography,complex
the seven-volume book of optics kitab al-manathir hugely influenced thinking across disciplines from the theory of visual perception to the nature of perspective in medieval art in both the east and the west for more than years,complex
many later european scholars and fellow polymaths from robert grosseteste and leonardo da vinci to rené descartes johannes kepler and isaac newton were in his debt,complex
indeed the influence of ibn al-haytham 's optics ranks alongside that of newton 's work of the same title published years later,complex
the translation of the book of optics had a huge impact on europe,complex
from it later european scholars were able to build devices that replicated those ibn al-haytham had built and understand the way light works,complex
from this such important things as eyeglasses magnifying glasses telescopes and cameras were developed,complex
physics became a separate science when early modern europeans used experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now considered to be the laws of physics,complex
major developments in this period include the replacement of the geocentric model of the solar system with the heliocentric copernican model the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies determined by johannes kepler between and pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy by galileo galilei in the th and th centuries and isaac newton 's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and universal gravitation that would come to bear his name,complex
newton also developed calculus the mathematical study of change which provided new mathematical methods for solving physical problems,complex
the discovery of new laws in thermodynamics chemistry and electromagnetics resulted from greater research efforts during the industrial revolution as energy needs increased,complex
the laws comprising classical physics remain very widely used for objects on everyday scales travelling at non-relativistic speeds since they provide a very close approximation in such situations and theories such as quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity simplify to their classical equivalents at such scales,complex
however inaccuracies in classical mechanics for very small objects and very high velocities led to the development of modern physics in the th century,complex
modern physics began in the early th century with the work of max planck in quantum theory and albert einstein 's theory of relativity,complex
both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical mechanics in certain situations,complex
classical mechanics predicted a varying speed of light which could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by maxwell 's equations of electromagnetism this discrepancy was corrected by einstein 's theory of special relativity which replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving bodies and allowed for a constant speed of light,complex
black body radiation provided another problem for classical physics which was corrected when planck proposed that the excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete steps proportional to their frequency this along with the photoelectric effect and a complete theory predicting discrete energy levels of electron orbitals led to the theory of quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small scales,complex
quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by werner heisenberg erwin schrödinger and paul dirac,complex
from this early work and work in related fields the standard model of particle physics was derived,complex
following the discovery of a particle with properties consistent with the higgs boson at cern in all fundamental particles predicted by the standard model and no others appear to exist however physics beyond the standard model with theories such as supersymmetry is an active area of research,complex
areas of mathematics in general are important to this field such as the study of probabilities and groups,complex
in many ways physics stems from ancient greek philosophy,complex
from thales ' first attempt to characterise matter to democritus ' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant state the ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament and aristotle 's book physics an early book on physics which attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point of view various greek philosophers advanced their own theories of nature,complex
physics was known as natural philosophy until the late th century,complex
by the th century physics was realised as a discipline distinct from philosophy and the other sciences,complex
physics as with the rest of science relies on philosophy of science and its scientific method to advance our knowledge of the physical world,complex
the scientific method employs a priori reasoning as well as a posteriori reasoning and the use of bayesian inference to measure the validity of a given theory,complex
the development of physics has answered many questions of early philosophers but has also raised new questions,complex
study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics the philosophy of physics involves issues such as the nature of space and time determinism and metaphysical outlooks such as empiricism naturalism and realism,complex
many physicists have written about the philosophical implications of their work for instance laplace who championed causal determinism and erwin schrödinger who wrote on quantum mechanics,complex
the mathematical physicist roger penrose had been called a platonist by stephen hawking a view penrose discusses in his book the road to reality,complex
hawking referred to himself as an unashamed reductionist and took issue with penrose 's views,complex
though physics deals with a wide variety of systems certain theories are used by all physicists,complex
each of these theories were experimentally tested numerous times and found to be an adequate approximation of nature,complex
for instance the theory of classical mechanics accurately describes the motion of objects provided they are much larger than atoms and moving at much less than the speed of light,complex
these theories continue to be areas of active research today,complex
chaos theory a remarkable aspect of classical mechanics was discovered in the th century three centuries after the original formulation of classical mechanics by isaac newton –,complex
these central theories are important tools for research into more specialised topics and any physicist regardless of their specialisation is expected to be literate in them,complex
these include classical mechanics quantum mechanics thermodynamics and statistical mechanics electromagnetism and special relativity,complex
classical physics includes the traditional branches and topics that were recognised and well-developed before the beginning of the th century—classical mechanics acoustics optics thermodynamics and electromagnetism,complex
classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by forces and bodies in motion and may be divided into statics study of the forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration kinematics study of motion without regard to its causes and dynamics study of motion and the forces that affect it mechanics may also be divided into solid mechanics and fluid mechanics known together as continuum mechanics the latter include such branches as hydrostatics hydrodynamics aerodynamics and pneumatics,complex
acoustics is the study of how sound is produced controlled transmitted and received,complex
important modern branches of acoustics include ultrasonics the study of sound waves of very high frequency beyond the range of human hearing bioacoustics the physics of animal calls and hearing and electroacoustics the manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics,complex
optics the study of light is concerned not only with visible light but also with infrared and ultraviolet radiation which exhibit all of the phenomena of visible light except visibility e,complex
g,complex
reflection refraction interference diffraction dispersion and polarization of light,complex
heat is a form of energy the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy,complex
electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch of physics since the intimate connection between them was discovered in the early th century an electric current gives rise to a magnetic field and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current,complex
electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest electrodynamics with moving charges and magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest,complex
classical physics is generally concerned with matter and energy on the normal scale of observation while much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on a very large or very small scale,complex
for example atomic and nuclear physics studies matter on the smallest scale at which chemical elements can be identified,complex
the physics of elementary particles is on an even smaller scale since it is concerned with the most basic units of matter this branch of physics is also known as high-energy physics because of the extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in particle accelerators,complex
on this scale ordinary commonsense notions of space time matter and energy are no longer valid,complex
the two chief theories of modern physics present a different picture of the concepts of space time and matter from that presented by classical physics,complex
classical mechanics approximates nature as continuous while quantum theory is concerned with the discrete nature of many phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level and with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of such phenomena,complex
the theory of relativity is concerned with the description of phenomena that take place in a frame of reference that is in motion with respect to an observer the special theory of relativity is concerned with motion in the absence of gravitational fields and the general theory of relativity with motion and its connection with gravitation,complex
both quantum theory and the theory of relativity find applications in all areas of modern physics,complex
while physics aims to discover universal laws its theories lie in explicit domains of applicability,complex
loosely speaking the laws of classical physics accurately describe systems whose important length scales are greater than the atomic scale and whose motions are much slower than the speed of light,complex
outside of this domain observations do not match predictions provided by classical mechanics,complex
albert einstein contributed the framework of special relativity which replaced notions of absolute time and space with spacetime and allowed an accurate description of systems whose components have speeds approaching the speed of light,complex
max planck erwin schrödinger and others introduced quantum mechanics a probabilistic notion of particles and interactions that allowed an accurate description of atomic and subatomic scales,complex
later quantum field theory unified quantum mechanics and special relativity,complex
general relativity allowed for a dynamical curved spacetime with which highly massive systems and the large-scale structure of the universe can be well-described,complex
general relativity has not yet been unified with the other fundamental descriptions several candidate theories of quantum gravity are being developed,complex
,complex
mathematics provides a compact and exact language used to describe the order in nature,complex
this was noted and advocated by pythagoras plato galileo and newton,complex
physics uses mathematics to organise and formulate experimental results,complex
from those results precise or estimated solutions are obtained quantitative results from which new predictions can be made and experimentally confirmed or negated,complex
the results from physics experiments are numerical data with their units of measure and estimates of the errors in the measurements,complex
technologies based on mathematics like computation have made computational physics an active area of research,complex
ontology is a prerequisite for physics but not for mathematics,complex
it means physics is ultimately concerned with descriptions of the real world while mathematics is concerned with abstract patterns even beyond the real world,complex
thus physics statements are synthetic while mathematical statements are analytic,complex
the term milk comes from old english meoluc west saxon milc anglian from proto-germanic meluks milk source also of old norse mjolk old frisian melok old saxon miluk dutch melk old high german miluh german milch gothic miluks,complex
milk consumption occurs in two distinct overall types : a natural source of nutrition for all infant mammals and a food product obtained from other mammals for consumption by humans of all ages,complex
in almost all mammals milk is fed to infants through breastfeeding either directly or by expressing the milk to be stored and consumed later,complex
the early milk from mammals is called colostrum,complex
colostrum contains antibodies that provide protection to the newborn baby as well as nutrients and growth factors,complex
the makeup of the colostrum and the period of secretion varies from species to species,complex
for humans the world health organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months and breastfeeding in addition to other food for at least two years,complex
in some cultures it is common to breastfeed children for three to five years and the period may be longer,complex
fresh goats ' milk is sometimes substituted for breast milk which introduces the risk of the child developing electrolyte imbalances metabolic acidosis megaloblastic anemia and a host of allergic reactions,complex
in many cultures especially in the west humans continue to consume milk beyond infancy using the milk of other mammals especially cattle goats and sheep as a food product,complex
initially the ability to digest milk was limited to children as adults did not produce lactase an enzyme necessary for digesting the lactose in milk,complex
people therefore converted milk to curd cheese and other products to reduce the levels of lactose,complex
thousands of years ago a chance mutation spread in human populations in europe that enabled the production of lactase in adulthood,complex
this mutation allowed milk to be used as a new source of nutrition which could sustain populations when other food sources failed,complex
people process milk into a variety of products such as cream butter yogurt kefir ice cream and cheese,complex
modern industrial processes use milk to produce casein whey protein lactose condensed milk powdered milk and many other food-additives and industrial products,complex
whole milk butter and cream have high levels of saturated fat,complex
the sugar lactose is found only in milk forsythia flowers and a few tropical shrubs,complex
the enzyme needed to digest lactose lactase reaches its highest levels in the human small intestine after birth and then begins a slow decline unless milk is consumed regularly,complex
those groups who do continue to tolerate milk however often have exercised great creativity in using the milk of domesticated ungulates not only of cattle but also sheep goats yaks water buffalo horses reindeer and camels,complex
india is the largest producer and consumer of cattle and buffalo milk in the world,complex
in food use from the term milk has been defined under codex alimentarius standards as : the normal mammary secretion of milking animals obtained from one or more milkings without either addition to it or extraction from it intended for consumption as liquid milk or for further processing,complex
this definition therefore precludes non-animal products which resemble dairy milk in color and texture such as almond milk coconut milk rice milk and soy milk,complex
in english the word milk has been used to refer to milk like plant juices since the late s,complex
the term dairy relates to animal milk and animal milk production,complex
in addition a substance secreted by pigeons to feed their young is called crop milk and bears some resemblance to mammalian milk although it is not consumed as a milk substitute,complex
the mammary gland is thought to have derived from apocrine skin glands,complex
it has been suggested that the original function of lactation milk production was keeping eggs moist,complex
much of the argument is based on monotremes egg-laying mammals,complex
the original adaptive significance of milk secretions may have been nutrition or immunological protection,complex
this secretion gradually became more copious and accrued nutritional complexity over evolutionary time,complex
tritylodontid cynodonts seem to have displayed lactation based on their dental replacement patterns,complex
humans first learned to consume the milk of other mammals regularly following the domestication of animals during the neolithic revolution or the development of agriculture,complex
this development occurred independently in several global locations from as early as – bc in mesopotamia to – bc in the americas,complex
people first domesticated the most important dairy animals—cattle sheep and goats—in southwest asia although domestic cattle had been independently derived from wild aurochs populations several times since,complex
the word water comes from old english wæter from proto-germanic watar source also of old saxon watar old frisian wetir dutch water old high german wazzar german wasser old norse vatn gothic wato from proto-indoeuropean wod-or suffixed form of root wed- water wet,complex
water ho is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid nearly colorless with a hint of blue,complex
this simplest hydrogen chalcogenide is by far the most studied chemical compound and is described as the universal solvent for its ability to dissolve many substances,complex
this allows it to be the solvent of life,complex
it is the only common substance to exist as a solid liquid and gas in normal terrestrial conditions,complex
water is a liquid at the temperatures and pressures that are most adequate for life,complex
specifically at a standard pressure of atm water is a liquid between and °c and °f,complex
increasing the pressure slightly lowers the melting point which is about − °c °f at atm and − °c − °f at atm,complex
this effect is relevant for example to ice skating to the buried lakes of antarctica and to the movement of glaciers,complex
at pressures higher than atm the melting point rapidly increases again and ice takes several exotic forms that do not exist at lower pressures,complex
increasing the pressure has a more dramatic effect on the boiling point that is about °c °f at atm,complex
this effect is important in among other things deep-sea hydrothermal vents and geysers pressure cooking and steam engine design,complex
at the top of mount everest where the atmospheric pressure is about,complex
atm water boils at °c °f,complex
at very low pressures below about,complex
atm water can not exist in the liquid state and passes directly from solid to gas by sublimation—a phenomenon exploited in the freeze drying of food,complex
at very high pressures above atm the liquid and gas states are no longer distinguishable a state called supercritical steam,complex
water also differs from most liquids in that it becomes less dense as it freezes,complex
the maximum density of water in its liquid form at atm is kg/m,complex
lb/cu ft that occurs at,complex
°c,complex
°f,complex
the density of ice is kg/m,complex
lb/cu ft,complex
thus water expands in volume as it freezes which accounts for the fact that ice floats on liquid water,complex
the details of the exact chemical nature of liquid water are not well understood some theories suggest that water 's unusual behaviour is as a result of it having liquid states,complex
pure water is usually described as tasteless and odorless although humans have specific sensors that can feel the presence of water in their mouths and frogs are known to be able to smell it,complex
however water from ordinary sources including bottled mineral water usually has many dissolved substances that may give it varying tastes and odors,complex
humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid,complex
the apparent color of natural bodies of water and swimming pools is often determined more by dissolved and suspended solids or by reflection of the sky than by water itself,complex
light in the visible electromagnetic spectrum can traverse a couple meters of pure water or ice without significant absorption so that it looks transparent and colorless,complex
thus aquatic plants algae and other photosynthetic organisms can live in water up to hundreds of meters deep because sunlight can reach them,complex
the history of human rights has not been entirely progressive,complex
many established rights would be replaced by other less tolerant systems,complex
stable institutions may be uprooted such as in cases of conflict such as war and terrorism,complex
the earliest conceptualisation of human rights is credited to ideas about natural rights emanating from natural law,complex
the northeast african civilization of ancient egypt supported basic human rights,complex
for example pharaoh bocchoris - bc promoted individual rights suppressed imprisonment for debt and reformed laws relating to the transferral of property,complex
the first recording of human rights were inscribed by cyrus the great the founder of the achaemenid empire into the cyrus cylinder,complex
the cyrus cylinder is a clay tablet created in b,complex
c,complex
soon after the achaemenid conquest of the neo-babylonian empire,complex
additionally it stated the freedom to practice one 's faith without persecution and forced conversions,complex
the mauryan emperor ashoka who ruled from to bce established the largest empire in south asia,complex
following the reportedly destructive kalinga war ashoka adopted buddhism and abandoned an expansionist policy in favor of humanitarian reforms,complex
the edicts of ashoka were erected throughout his empire containing the 'law of piety ',complex
these laws prohibited slavery religious discrimination and cruelty against both humans and animals,complex
later documents pertaining to human rights can be referenced in the constitution of medina al-risalah al-huquq late th to early th century magna carta the german peasants ' war twelve articles the english bill of rights the french declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen and the bill of rights in the united states constitution,complex
the statute of kalisz bestowed privileges to the jewish minority in the kingdom of poland such as protection from discrimination and hate speech,complex
samuel moyn suggests that the concept of human rights is intertwined with the modern sense of citizenship which did not emerge until the past few hundred years,complex
th-century english philosopher john locke discussed natural rights in his work identifying them as being life liberty and estate property and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the social contract,complex
in britain in the english bill of rights and the scottish claim of right each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions,complex
two major revolutions occurred during the th century in the united states and in france leading to the united states declaration of independence and the french declaration of the rights of man and of the citizen respectively both of which articulated certain human rights,complex
additionally the virginia declaration of rights of encoded into law a number of fundamental civil rights and civil freedoms,complex
we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness,complex
these were followed by developments in philosophy of human rights by philosophers such as thomas paine john stuart mill and g,complex
w,complex
f,complex
hegel during the th and th centuries,complex
the term human rights probably came into use some time between paine 's the rights of man and william lloyd garrison 's writings in the liberator in which he stated that he was trying to enlist his readers in the great cause of human rights,complex
although the term had been used by at least one author as early as,complex
in the th century human rights became a central concern over the issue of slavery,complex
a number of reformers notably british member of parliament william wilberforce worked towards the abolition of the atlantic slave trade and abolition of slavery,complex
this was achieved across the british empire by the slave trade act which was enforced internationally by the royal navy under treaties britain negotiated with other nations and the slavery abolition act,complex
in the united states all the northern states had abolished the institution of slavery between and although southern states clung tightly to the peculiar institution,complex
conflict and debates over the expansion of slavery to new territories constituted one of the reasons for the southern states ' secession and the american civil war,complex
during the reconstruction period immediately following the war several amendments to the united states constitution were made,complex
these included the th amendment banning slavery the th amendment assuring full citizenship and civil rights to all people born in the united states and the th amendment guaranteeing african americans the right to vote,complex
in russia the reformer tsar alexander ii ended serfdom in although the freed serfs often faced restrictions of their mobility within the nation,complex
many groups and movements have achieved profound social changes over the course of the th century in the name of human rights,complex
in europe and north america labour unions brought about laws granting workers the right to strike establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating child labour,complex
the women 's rights movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to vote,complex
national liberation movements in many countries succeeded in driving out colonial powers,complex
one of the most influential was mahatma gandhi 's movement to free his native india from british rule,complex
movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world among them the civil rights movement and more recent movements on behalf of women and minorities in the united states,complex
the establishment of the international committee of the red cross the lieber code and the first of the geneva conventions in laid the foundations of international humanitarian law to be further developed following the two world wars,complex
the world wars and the huge losses of life and gross abuses of human rights that took place during them were a driving force behind the development of modern human rights instruments,complex
the league of nations was established in at the negotiations over the treaty of versailles following the end of world war i,complex
the league 's goals included disarmament preventing war through collective security settling disputes between countries through negotiation and diplomacy and improving global welfare,complex
enshrined in its charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights later included in the universal declaration of human rights,complex
at the yalta conference the allied powers agreed to create a new body to supplant the league 's role this was to be the united nations,complex
in the perspective of the history of art artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind : from early pre-historic art to contemporary art however some theories restrict the concept of artistic works to modern western societies,complex
one early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older latin meaning which roughly translates to skill or craft as associated with words such as artisan,complex
english words derived from this meaning include artifact artificial artifice medical arts and military arts,complex
however there are many other colloquial uses of the word all with some relation to its etymology,complex
over time philosophers like plato aristotle socrates and kant among others questioned the meaning of art,complex
several dialogues in plato tackle questions about art : socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational,complex
he speaks approvingly of this and other forms of divine madness drunkenness eroticism and dreaming in the phaedrus a–c and yet in the republic wants to outlaw homer 's great poetic art and laughter as well,complex
in ion socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of homer that he expresses in the republic,complex
the dialogue ion suggests that homer 's iliad functioned in the ancient greek world as the bible does today in the modern christian world : as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance if only it can be properly interpreted,complex
with regards to the literary art and the musical arts aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art each varying in imitation by medium object and manner,complex
for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language,complex
the forms also differ in their object of imitation,complex
comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average,complex
lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama,complex
aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind 's advantages over animals,complex
the second and more recent sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early th century,complex
fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist 's creativity or to engage the audience 's aesthetic sensibilities or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer work of art,complex
within this latter sense the word art may refer to several things : i a study of a creative skill ii a process of using the creative skill iii a product of the creative skill or iv the audience 's experience with the creative skill,complex
the creative arts art as discipline are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks art as objects that are compelled by a personal drive art as activity and convey a message mood or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret art as experience,complex
art is something that stimulates an individual 's thoughts emotions beliefs or ideas through the senses,complex
works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects,complex
for some scholars such as kant the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression,complex
often if the skill is being used in a common or practical way people will consider it a craft instead of art,complex
likewise if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art,complex
on the other hand crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art,complex
some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference,complex
however even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression,complex
the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas such as in politically spiritually or philosophically motivated art to create a sense of beauty see aesthetics to explore the nature of perception for pleasure or to generate strong emotions,complex
the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent,complex
the nature of art has been described by philosopher richard wollheim as one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture,complex
art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake and as mimesis or representation,complex
art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of aristotle,complex
leo tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another,complex
benedetto croce and r,complex
g,complex
collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator,complex
the theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of kant and was developed in the early twentieth century by roger fry and clive bell,complex
more recently thinkers influenced by martin heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation,complex
george dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as the art world has conferred the status of candidate for appreciation,complex
first used in english in the word parasite comes from the medieval french parasite from the latin parasitus the latinisation of the greek παράσιτος parasitos one who eats at the table of another and that from παρά para beside by σῖτος sitos wheat hence food,complex
the related term parasitism appears in english from,complex
,complex
parasitism is a kind of symbiosis a close and persistent long-term biological interaction between the parasite and its host,complex
unlike commensalism and mutualism the parasitic relationship harms the host either feeding on it or as in the case of intestinal parasites consuming some of its food,complex
because parasites interact with other species they are well placed to act as vectors of pathogens microscopic parasites that cause disease,complex
predation is not generally considered a symbiosis as the interaction is brief but the entomologist e,complex
o,complex
wilson has characterised parasites as predators that eat prey in units of less than one,complex
within that scope are many possible ways of life,complex
parasites are classified in a variety of different but overlapping schemes based on their interactions with their hosts and on their life cycles which are sometimes very complex,complex
an obligate parasite is totally dependent on the host to complete its life cycle while a facultative parasite is not,complex
parasite life cycles involving only one host are called direct those with a definitive host where the parasite reproduces sexually and at least one intermediate host are called indirect,complex
an endoparasite is one that lives inside the host 's body an ectoparasite lives outside on the host 's surface,complex
mesoparasites like some copepods enter an opening in the host 's body and remain partly embedded there,complex
it is possible for parasites to be generalists feeding on a wide range of hosts but many parasites and the majority of protozoans and helminths that parasitise animals are specialists and extremely host-specific,complex
an early basic functional division of parasites was that of microparasites and macroparasites,complex
these each had a mathematical model assigned in order to analyse the population movements of the host–parasite groupings,complex
the microorganisms and viruses that can reproduce and complete their life cycle within the host are known as microparasites,complex
macroparasites are the multicellular organisms that reproduce and complete their life cycle outside of the host or on the host 's body,complex
much of the thinking on types of parasitism has focussed on terrestrial animal parasites of animals such as helminths,complex
those in other environments and with other hosts often have analogous strategies,complex
for example the snubnosed eel is probably a facultative endoparasite that opportunistically burrows into and eats sick and dying fish,complex
plant-eating insects such as scale insects aphids and caterpillars are much like ectoparasites attacking much larger plants they serve as vectors of bacteria fungi and viruses which cause plant diseases,complex
as female scale insects are unable to move they are obligate parasites permanently attached to their hosts,complex
there are six major parasitic strategies namely parasitic castration directly transmitted parasitism trophically transmitted parasitism vector-transmitted parasitism parasitoidism and micropredation,complex
these apply to parasites whose hosts are plants as well as animals,complex
these strategies represent adaptive peaks intermediate strategies are possible but organisms in many different groups have consistently converged on these six which are evolutionarily stable,complex
a perspective on the evolutionary options can be gained by considering four questions : the effect on the fitness of a parasite 's hosts the number of hosts they have per life stage whether the host is prevented from reproducing and whether the effect depends on intensity number of parasites per host,complex
from this analysis the major evolutionary strategies of parasitism emerge alongside predation,complex
parasitic castrators partly or completely destroy their host 's ability to reproduce diverting the energy that would have gone into reproduction into host and parasite growth sometimes causing gigantism in the host,complex
the host 's other systems are left intact allowing it to survive and sustain the parasite,complex
parasitic crustaceans such as those in the specialised barnacle genus sacculina specifically cause damage to the gonads of their many species of host crabs,complex
in the case of sacculina the testes of over two-thirds of their crab hosts degenerate sufficiently for these male crabs to have gained female secondary sex characteristics such as broader abdomens smaller claws and egg-grasping appendages,complex
various species of helminth castrate their hosts such as insects and snails,complex
this may be directly whether mechanically by feeding on their gonads or by secreting a chemical that destroys reproductive cells or indirectly whether by secreting a hormone or by diverting nutrients,complex
for example the trematode zoogonus lasius whose sporocysts lack mouths castrates the intertidal marine snail tritia obsoleta chemically developing in its gonad and killing its reproductive cells,complex
directly transmitted parasites not requiring a vector to reach their hosts include parasites of terrestrial vertebrates such as lice and mites marine parasites such as copepods and cyamid amphipods monogeneans and many species of nematodes fungi protozoans bacteria and viruses,complex
whether endoparasites or ectoparasites each has a single host species,complex
within that species most individuals are free or almost free of parasites while a minority carry a large number of parasites this highly uneven distribution is described as aggregated,complex
trophically transmitted parasites are transmitted by being eaten by a host,complex
they include trematodes all except schistosomes cestodes acanthocephalans pentastomids many round worms and many protozoa such as toxoplasma,complex
they have complex life cycles involving hosts of two or more species,complex
in their juvenile stages they infect and often encyst in the intermediate host,complex
when this animal is eaten by a predator the definitive host the parasite survives the digestion process and matures into an adult some live as intestinal parasites,complex
many trophically transmitted parasites modify the behaviour of their intermediate hosts increasing their chances of being eaten by a predator,complex
like directly transmitted parasites the distribution of trophically transmitted parasites among host individuals is aggregated,complex
coinfection by multiple parasites is common,complex
autoinfection where by exception the whole of the parasite 's life cycle takes place in a single primary host can sometimes occur in helminths such as strongyloides stercoralis,complex
vector-transmitted parasites rely on a third party an intermediate host where the parasite does not reproduce sexually to carry them from one definitive host to another,complex
these parasites are microorganisms namely protozoa bacteria or viruses often intracellular pathogens causing disease,complex
their vectors are mostly hematophagic arthropods such as fleas lice ticks and mosquitoes,complex
for example the deer tick ixodes scapularis acts as a vector for diseases including lyme disease babesiosis and anaplasmosis,complex
protozoan endoparasites such as the malarial parasites in the genus plasmodium and sleeping sickness parasites in the genus trypanosoma infective stages in the host 's blood are transported to new hosts by biting insects,complex
parasitoids are insects which sooner or later kill their hosts placing their relationship close to predation,complex
most parasitoids are hymenopterans parasitoid wasps others include dipterans such as phorid flies,complex
they can be divided into two groups idiobionts and koinobionts differing in their treatment of their hosts,complex
idiobiont parasitoids sting their often large prey on capture either killing them outright or paralysing them immediately,complex
the immobilised prey is then carried to a nest sometimes alongside other prey if it is not large enough to support a parasitoid throughout its development,complex
an egg is laid on top of the prey and the nest is then sealed,complex
the parasitoid develops rapidly through its larval and pupal stages feeding on the provisions left for it,complex
koinobiont parasitoids which include flies as well as wasps lay their eggs inside young hosts usually larvae,complex
these are allowed to go on growing so the host and parasitoid develop together for an extended period ending when the parasitoids emerge as adults leaving the prey dead eaten from inside,complex
some koinobionts regulate their host 's development for example preventing it from pupating or making it moult whenever the parasitoid is ready to moult,complex
they may do this by producing hormones that mimic the host 's moulting hormones ecdysteroids or by regulating the host 's endocrine system,complex
a micropredator attacks more than one host reducing each host 's fitness at least a small amount and is only in contact with any one host intermittently,complex
this makes them suitable as vectors as they can pass smaller parasites from one host to another,complex
most micropredators are hematophagic feeding on blood,complex
they include annelids such as leeches crustaceans such as branchiurans and gnathiid isopods various dipterans such as mosquitoes and tsetse flies other arthropods such as fleas and ticks vertebrates such as lampreys and mammals such as vampire bats,complex
parasites use a variety of methods to infect animal hosts including physical contact the fecal–oral route free-living infectious stages and vectors suiting their differing hosts life cycles and ecological contexts,complex
examples to illustrate some of the many possible combinations are given in the table,complex
among the many variations on parasitic strategies are hyperparasitism social parasitism brood parasitism kleptoparasitism sexual parasitism and adelphoparasitism,complex
hyperparasites feed on another parasite as exemplified by protozoa living in helminth parasites or facultative or obligate parasitoids whose hosts are either conventional parasites or parasitoids,complex
levels of parasitism beyond secondary also occur especially among facultative parasitoids,complex
in oak gall systems there can be up to five levels of parasitism,complex
hyperparasites can control their hosts ' populations and are used for this purpose in agriculture and to some extent in medicine,complex
the controlling effects can be seen in the way that the chv virus helps to control the damage that chestnut blight cryphonectria parasitica does to american chestnut trees and in the way that bacteriophages can limit bacterial infections,complex
it is likely though little researched that most pathogenic microparasites have hyperparasites which may prove widely useful in both agriculture and medicine,complex
social parasites take advantage of interspecific interactions between members of social animals such as ants termites and bumblebees,complex
examples include the large blue butterfly phengaris arion its larvae employing ant mimicry to parasitise certain ants bombus bohemicus a bumblebee which invades the hives of other bees and takes over reproduction while their young are raised by host workers and melipona scutellaris a eusocial bee whose virgin queens escape killer workers and invade another colony without a queen,complex
an extreme example of interspecific social parasitism is found in the ant tetramorium inquilinum an obligate parasite which lives exclusively on the backs of other tetramorium ants,complex
emery 's rule notes that social parasites tend to be closely related to their hosts often being in the same genus,complex
intraspecific social parasitism occurs in parasitic nursing where some individual young take milk from unrelated females,complex
in wedge-capped capuchins higher ranking females sometimes take milk from low ranking females without any reciprocation,complex
in brood parasitism the hosts act as parents as they raise the young as their own,complex
brood parasites include birds in different families such as cowbirds whydahs cuckoos and black-headed ducks,complex
these do not build nests of their own but leave their eggs in nests of other species,complex
the eggs of some brood parasites mimic those of their hosts while some cowbird eggs have tough shells making them hard for the hosts to kill by piercing both mechanisms implying selection by the hosts against parasitic eggs,complex
the adult female european cuckoo further mimics a predator the european sparrowhawk giving her time to lay her eggs in the host 's nest unobserved,complex
in kleptoparasitism from greek κλέπτης kleptēs thief parasites steal food gathered by the host,complex
the parasitism is often on close relatives whether within the same species or between species in the same genus or family,complex
for instance the many lineages of cuckoo bees lay their eggs in the nest cells of other bees in the same family,complex
kleptoparasitism is uncommon generally but conspicuous in birds some such as skuas are specialised in pirating food from other seabirds relentlessly chasing them down until they disgorge their catch,complex
a unique approach is seen in some species of anglerfish such as ceratias holboelli where the males are reduced to tiny sexual parasites wholly dependent on females of their own species for survival permanently attached below the female 's body and unable to fend for themselves,complex
the female nourishes the male and protects him from predators while the male gives nothing back except the sperm that the female needs to produce the next generation,complex
adelphoparasitism from greek ἀδελφός adelphós brother also known as sibling-parasitism occurs where the host species is closely related to the parasite often in the same family or genus,complex
in the citrus blackfly parasitoid encarsia perplexa unmated females of which may lay haploid eggs in the fully developed larvae of their own species producing male offspring while the marine worm bonellia viridis has a similar reproductive strategy although the larvae are planktonic,complex
examples of the major variant strategies are illustrated,complex
a wide range of organisms is parasitic from animals plants and fungi to protozoans bacteria and viruses,complex
parasitism is widespread in the animal kingdom and has evolved independently from free-living forms hundreds of times,complex
many types of helminth including flukes and cestodes have complex life cycles involving two or more hosts,complex
by far the largest group is the parasitoid wasps in the hymenoptera,complex
the phyla and classes with the largest numbers of parasitic species are listed in the table,complex
numbers are conservative minimum estimates,complex
the columns for endo- and ecto-parasitism refer to the definitive host as documented in the vertebrate and invertebrate columns,complex
a hemiparasite or partial parasite such as mistletoe derives some of its nutrients from another living plant and a holoparasite such as dodder derives all of its nutrients from another plant,complex
other collaborative online encyclopedias were attempted before wikipedia but none were as successful,complex
wikipedia began as a complementary project for nupedia a free online english-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process,complex
it was founded on march under the ownership of bomis a web portal company,complex
its main figures were bomis ceo jimmy wales and larry sanger editor-in-chief for nupedia and later wikipedia,complex
nupedia was initially licensed under its own nupedia open content license but even before wikipedia was founded nupedia switched to the gnu free documentation license at the urging of richard stallman,complex
wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia while sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal,complex
on january sanger proposed on the nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a feeder project for nupedia,complex
wikipedia,complex
com and wikipedia,complex
org were registered on january and january respectively and wikipedia was launched on january as a single english-language edition at www,complex
wikipedia,complex
com and announced by sanger on the nupedia mailing list,complex
wikipedia 's policy of neutral point-of-view was codified in its first months,complex
otherwise there were relatively few rules initially and wikipedia operated independently of nupedia,complex
originally bomis intended to make wikipedia a business for profit,complex
wikipedia gained early contributors from nupedia slashdot postings and web search engine indexing,complex
language editions were also created with a total of by the end of,complex
nupedia and wikipedia coexisted until the former 's servers were taken down permanently in and its text was incorporated into wikipedia,complex
the english wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on september making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled surpassing the yongle encyclopedia which had held the record for almost years,complex
citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in wikipedia users of the spanish wikipedia forked from wikipedia to create the enciclopedia libre in february,complex
these moves encouraged wales to announce that wikipedia would not display advertisements and to change wikipedia 's domain from wikipedia,complex
com to wikipedia,complex
org,complex
though the english wikipedia reached three million articles in august the growth of the edition in terms of the numbers of new articles and of contributors appears to have peaked around early,complex
around articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in by that average was roughly,complex
a team at the palo alto research center attributed this slowing of growth to the project 's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change,complex
others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called low-hanging fruit—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively,complex
in november a researcher at the rey juan carlos university in madrid spain found that the english wikipedia had lost editors during the first three months of in comparison the project lost only editors during the same period in,complex
the wall street journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend,complex
wales disputed these claims in denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study,complex
two years later in wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline noting a decrease from a little more than writers in june to in june,complex
in the same interview wales also claimed the number of editors was stable and sustainable,complex
a article titled the decline of wikipedia in mit 's technology review questioned this claim,complex
the article revealed that since wikipedia had lost a third of the volunteer editors who update and correct the online encyclopedia and those still there have focused increasingly on minutiae,complex
in july the atlantic reported that the number of administrators is also in decline,complex
in the november issue of new york magazine katherine ward stated wikipedia the sixth-most-used website is facing an internal crisis,complex

the concept of document has been defined by suzanne briet as any concrete or symbolic indication preserved or recorded for reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon whether physical or mental,complex
an often cited article concludes that the evolving notion of document among jonathan priest otlet briet schürmeyer and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents,complex
the shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important,complex

document is defined in library and information science and documentation science as a fundamental abstract idea : the word denotes everything that may be represented or memorialized in order to serve as evidence,complex
the classic example provided by suzanne briet is an antelope : an antelope running wild on the plains of africa should not be considered a document [ ] she rules,complex

it has become physical evidence being used by those who study it,complex
indeed scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents since the antelope itself is the primary document,complex
this opinion has been interpreted as an early expression of actor–network theory,complex
documents are sometimes classified as secret private or public,complex
they may also be described as drafts or proofs,complex
when a document is copied the source is denominated the original,complex
standards are accepted for specific applications in various fields e,complex

the page layout of a document is the manner in which information is graphically arranged in the space of the document e,complex
g,complex

if the appearance of the document is of concern page layout is generally the responsibility of a graphic designer,complex
typography concerns the design of letter and symbol forms and their physical arrangement in the document see typesetting,complex
information design concerns the effective communication of information especially in industrial documents and public signs,complex
the word book comes from old english bōc which in turn comes from the germanic root bōk- cognate to beech,complex
similarly in slavic languages for example russian bulgarian macedonian буква bukva—letter is cognate with beech,complex
in russian and in serbian and macedonian the word букварь bukvar ' or буквар bukvar refers specifically to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing,complex
it is thus conjectured that the earliest indo-european writings may have been carved on beech wood,complex
similarly the latin word codex meaning a book in the modern sense bound and with separate leaves originally meant block of wood,complex
,complex
when writing systems were created in ancient civilizations a variety of objects such as stone clay tree bark metal sheets and bones were used for writing these are studied in epigraphy,complex
a tablet is a physically robust writing medium suitable for casual transport and writing,complex
clay tablets were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could be easily carried and impressed with a stylus,complex
they were used as a writing medium especially for writing in cuneiform throughout the bronze age and well into the iron age,complex
wax tablets were pieces of wood covered in a thick enough coating of wax to record the impressions of a stylus,complex
they were the normal writing material in schools in accounting and for taking notes,complex
they had the advantage of being reusable : the wax could be melted and reformed into a blank,complex
the custom of binding several wax tablets together roman pugillares is a possible precursor of modern bound codex books,complex
the etymology of the word codex block of wood also suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets,complex
scrolls can be made from papyrus a thick paper-like material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool until it is flattened,complex
papyrus was used for writing in ancient egypt perhaps as early as the first dynasty although the first evidence is from the account books of king nefertiti kakai of the fifth dynasty about bc,complex
papyrus sheets were glued together to form a scroll,complex
tree bark such as lime and other materials were also used,complex
according to herodotus history : the phoenicians brought writing and papyrus to greece around the th or th century bc,complex
the greek word for papyrus as writing material biblion and book biblos come from the phoenician port town byblos through which papyrus was exported to greece,complex
from greek we also derive the word tome greek : τόμος which originally meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote a roll of papyrus,complex
tomus was used by the latins with exactly the same meaning as volumen see also below the explanation by isidore of seville,complex
whether made from papyrus parchment or paper scrolls were the dominant form of book in the hellenistic roman chinese hebrew and macedonian cultures,complex
the more modern codex book format form took over the roman world by late antiquity but the scroll format persisted much longer in asia,complex
isidore of seville d,complex
explained the then-current relation between codex book and scroll in his etymologiae vi,complex
: a codex is composed of many books a book is of one scroll,complex
it is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks codex of trees or vines as if it were a wooden stock because it contains in itself a multitude of books as it were of branches,complex
modern usage differs,complex
a codex in modern usage is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as a book : leaves of uniform size bound in some manner along one edge and typically held between two covers made of some more robust material,complex
the first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from martial in his apophoreta clxxxiv at the end of the first century where he praises its compactness,complex
however the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan hellenistic world and only within the christian community did it gain widespread use,complex
this change happened gradually during the rd and th centuries and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are several : the format is more economical as both sides of the writing material can be used and it is portable searchable and easy to conceal,complex
a book is much easier to read to find a page that you want and to flip through,complex
a scroll is more awkward to use,complex
the christian authors may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and judaic texts written on scrolls,complex
since musical notation only incompletely expresses a piece of music there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in a concert,complex
given the wide range of styles in european classical music from medieval plainchant sung by monks to classical and romantic symphonies for orchestra from the s and s to avant-garde atonal compositions for solo piano from the s it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type,complex
however there are characteristics that classical music contains that few or no other genres of music contain such as the use of music notation and the performance of complex forms of solo instrumental works e,complex
g,complex
the fugue,complex
furthermore while the symphony did not exist prior to the late th century the symphony ensemble—and the works written for it—have become a defining feature of classical music,complex
the key characteristic of european classical music that distinguishes it from popular music and folk music is that the repertoire tends to be written down in musical notation creating a musical part or score,complex
this score typically determines details of rhythm pitch and where two or more musicians whether singers or instrumentalists are involved how the various parts are coordinated,complex
the written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them : fugues for instance achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in counterpoint yet creating a coherent harmonic logic that would be difficult to achieve in the heat of live improvisation,complex
the use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago,complex
musical notation enables s-era performers to sing a choral work from the s renaissance era or a s baroque concerto with many of the features of the music the melodies lyrics forms and rhythms being reproduced,complex
that said the score does allow the interpreter to make choices on how to perform a historical work,complex
for example if the tempo is written with an italian instruction e,complex
g,complex
allegro it is not known exactly how fast the piece should be played,complex
as well in the baroque era many works that were designed for basso continuo accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument harpsichord lute etc,complex
should play the chords which are not notated in the part only a figured bass symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer,complex
the performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece including the phrasing of melodies the time taken during fermatas held notes or pauses and the use or choice not to use of effects such as vibrato or glissando these effects are possible on various stringed brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice,complex
although classical music in the s has lost most of its tradition for musical improvisation from the baroque era to the romantic era there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era,complex
in the baroque era organ performers would improvise preludes keyboard performers playing harpsichord would improvise chords from the figured bass symbols beneath the bass notes of the basso continuo part and both vocal and instrumental performers would improvise musical ornaments,complex
johann sebastian bach was particularly noted for his complex improvisations,complex
during the classical era the composer-performer mozart was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles,complex
during the classical era some virtuoso soloists would improvise the cadenza sections of a concerto,complex
during the romantic era beethoven would improvise at the piano,complex
for more information see improvisation,complex
the instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-th century often much earlier and systematised in the th and th centuries,complex
they consist of the instruments found in an orchestra or in a concert band together with several other solo instruments such as the piano harpsichord and organ,complex
the symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music and includes members of the string woodwind brass and percussion families of instruments,complex
the concert band consists of members of the woodwind brass and percussion families,complex
it generally has a larger variety and number of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section,complex
however many concert bands use a double bass,complex
the vocal practices changed over the classical period from the single line monophonic gregorian chant done by monks in the medieval period to the complex polyphonic choral works of the renaissance and subsequent periods which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time,complex
many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist but in different forms,complex
medieval instruments included the flute the recorder and plucked string instruments like the lute,complex
as well early versions of the organ and fiddle or vielle existed,complex
medieval instruments in europe had most commonly been used singly often self accompanied with a drone note or occasionally in parts,complex
from at least as early as the th century through the th century there was a division of instruments into haut loud shrill outdoor instruments and bas quieter more intimate instruments,complex
during the earlier medieval period the vocal music from the liturgical genre predominantly gregorian chant was monophonic using a single unaccompanied vocal melody line,complex
polyphonic vocal genres which used multiple independent vocal melodies began to develop during the high medieval era becoming prevalent by the later th and early th century,complex
many instruments originated during the renaissance others were variations of or improvements upon instruments that had existed previously,complex
some have survived to the present day others have disappeared only to be re-created in order to perform music on period instruments,complex
as in the modern day instruments may be classified as brass strings percussion and woodwind,complex
brass instruments in the renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were members of guilds and they included the slide trumpet the wooden cornet the valveless trumpet and the sackbut,complex
stringed instruments included the viol the rebec the harp-like lyre the hurdy-gurdy the lute the guitar the cittern the bandora and the orpharion,complex
keyboard instruments with strings included the harpsichord and the virginals,complex
percussion instruments include the triangle the jew 's harp the tambourine the bells the rumble-pot and various kinds of drums,complex
woodwind instruments included the double reed shawm the reed pipe the bagpipe the transverse flute the recorder the dulcian and the crumhorn,complex
vocal music in the renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate polyphonic style,complex
the principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire renaissance period were masses and motets with some other developments towards the end especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms such as the madrigal for their own designs,complex
towards the end of the period the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody the madrigal comedy and the intermedio are seen,complex
around italian composer jacopo peri wrote dafne the first work to be called an opera today,complex
he also composed euridice the first opera to have survived to the present day,complex
baroque instruments included some instruments from the earlier periods e,complex
g,complex
the hurdy-gurdy and recorder and a number of new instruments e,complex
g the oboe bassoon cello contrabass and fortepiano,complex
some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse such as the shawm and the wooden cornet,complex
the key baroque instruments for strings included the violin viol viola viola d'amore cello contrabass lute theorbo which often played the basso continuo parts mandolin cittern baroque guitar harp and hurdy-gurdy,complex
woodwinds included the baroque flute baroque oboe rackett recorder and the bassoon,complex
brass instruments included the cornett natural horn baroque trumpet serpent and the trombone,complex
keyboard instruments included the clavichord the harpsichord the pipe organ and later in the period the fortepiano an early version of the piano,complex
percussion instruments included the timpani snare drum tambourine and the castanets,complex
one major difference between baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in baroque ensembles were much less standardized,complex
whereas a classical era string quartet consists almost exclusively of two violins a viola and a cello a baroque or classical-era group accompanying a soloist or opera could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments e,complex
g,complex
pipe organ harpsichord or clavichord additional stringed chordal instruments e,complex
g,complex
a lute and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo including bowed strings woodwinds and brass instruments e,complex
g,complex
a cello contrabass viol bassoon serpent etc,complex
vocal developments in the baroque era included the development of opera types such as opera seria and opéra comique and related forms such as oratorios and cantatas,complex
the term classical music has two meanings : the broader meaning includes all western art music from the medieval era to the s and the specific meaning refers to the art music from the s to the early s—the period of wolfgang amadeus mozart joseph haydn and ludwig van beethoven,complex
this section is about the more specific meaning,complex
classical era musicians continued to use many of instruments from the baroque era such as the cello contrabass recorder trombone timpani fortepiano the precursor to the modern piano and organ,complex
while some baroque instruments fell into disuse e,complex
g,complex
the theorbo and rackett many baroque instruments were changed into the versions that are still in use today such as the baroque violin which became the violin the baroque oboe which became the oboe and the baroque trumpet which transitioned to the regular valved trumpet,complex
during the classical era the stringed instruments used in orchestra and chamber music such as string quartets were standardized as the four instruments which form the string section of the orchestra : the violin viola cello and double bass,complex
baroque-era stringed instruments such as fretted bowed viols were phased out,complex
woodwinds included the basset clarinet basset horn clarinette d'amour the classical clarinet the chalumeau the flute oboe and bassoon,complex
keyboard instruments included the clavichord and the fortepiano,complex
while the harpsichord was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the s and s it fell out of use in the end of the century,complex
brass instruments included the buccin the ophicleide a replacement for the bass serpent which was the precursor of the tuba and the natural horn,complex
in the romantic era the modern piano with a more powerful sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate-sounding fortepiano,complex
in the orchestra the existing classical instruments and sections were retained string section woodwinds brass and percussion but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller bigger sound,complex
for example while a baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players a romantic orchestra could have as many as ten,complex
as music grew more expressive the standard orchestral palette just was n't rich enough for many romantic composers,complex
new woodwind instruments were added such as the contrabassoon bass clarinet and piccolo and new percussion instruments were added including xylophones snare drums celestas a bell-like keyboard instrument bells and triangles large orchestral harps and even wind machines for sound effects,complex
saxophones appear in some scores from the late th century onwards,complex
while appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works for example maurice ravel 's orchestration of modest mussorgsky 's pictures at an exhibition and sergei rachmaninoff 's symphonic dances the saxophone is included in other works such as ravel 's boléro sergei prokofiev 's romeo and juliet suites and and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble,complex
the euphonium is featured in a few late romantic and th-century works usually playing parts marked tenor tuba including gustav holst 's the planets and richard strauss 's ein heldenleben,complex
the wagner tuba a modified member of the horn family appears in richard wagner 's cycle der ring des nibelungen and several other works by strauss béla bartók and others it has a prominent role in anton bruckner 's symphony no,complex
in e major,complex
cornets appear in pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky 's ballet swan lake claude debussy 's la mer and several orchestral works by hector berlioz,complex
unless these instruments are played by members doubling on another instrument for example a trombone player changing to euphonium for a certain passage orchestras will use freelance musicians to augment their regular rosters,complex
modernism in music is a philosophical and aesthetic stance underlying the period of change and development in musical language that occurred from to a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic melodic sonic and rhythmic aspects of music and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of modernism in the arts of the time,complex
the operative word most associated with it is innovation,complex
its leading feature is a linguistic plurality which is to say that no single music genre ever assumed a dominant position,complex
contemporary classical music is the period that came into prominence in the mid-s,complex
it includes different variations of modernist postmodern neoromantic and pluralist music,complex
however the term may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post- musical forms,complex
postmodern music is a period of music that began around,complex
it shares characteristics with postmodernist art – that is art that comes after and reacts against modernism,complex
many instruments that in the s are associated with popular music filled important roles in early music such as bagpipes theorbos vihuelas hurdy-gurdies hand-cranked string instruments accordions alphorns hydraulises calliopes sistrums and some woodwind instruments such as tin whistles panpipes shawms and crumhorns,complex
on the other hand instruments such as the acoustic guitar once associated mainly with popular music gained prominence in classical music in the th and th centuries in the form of the classical guitar and banjo,complex
while equal temperament gradually became accepted as the dominant musical temperament during the th century different historical temperaments are often used for music from earlier periods,complex
for instance music of the english renaissance is often performed in meantone temperament,complex
as well while professional orchestras and pop bands all around the world have tuned to an a fixed at hz since the late th century there was historically a great variety in the tuning pitch as attested to in historical pipe organs that still exist,complex
performers who have studied classical music extensively are said to be classically trained,complex
this training may come from private lessons from instrument or voice teachers or from completion of a formal program offered by a conservatory college or university such as a bachelor of music or master of music degree which includes individual lessons from professors,complex
in classical music,complex
extensive formal music education and training often to postgraduate [ master 's degree ] level is required,complex

this usage of the term referred to a human computer a person who carried out calculations or computations,complex
the word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the th century,complex
originally women were often hired as human computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts,complex

devices have been used to aid computation for thousands of years mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers,complex
the earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick,complex
later record keeping aids throughout the fertile crescent included calculi clay spheres cones etc,complex
which represented counts of items probably livestock or grains sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers,complex
the use of counting rods is one example,complex
the abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks,complex
the roman abacus was developed from devices used in babylonia as early as bc,complex

the slide rule was invented around – shortly after the publication of the concept of the logarithm,complex
it is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division,complex
as slide rule development progressed added scales provided reciprocals squares and square roots cubes and cube roots as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions,complex

the tide-predicting machine invented by sir william thomson in was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters,complex
it used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location,complex
the differential analyser a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration,complex
in lord kelvin had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators,complex
in a differential analyzer the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator or a graphing output,complex
the torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work,complex
starting in the s vannevar bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers,complex
charles babbage an english mechanical engineer and polymath originated the concept of a programmable computer,complex
considered the father of the computer he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early th century,complex
after working on his revolutionary difference engine designed to aid in navigational calculations in he realized that a much more general design an analytical engine was possible,complex
the input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the jacquard loom,complex
for output the machine would have a printer a curve plotter and a bell,complex
the machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later,complex
the engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops and integrated memory making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as turing-complete,complex
the machine was about a century ahead of its time,complex
all the parts for his machine had to be made by hand – this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts,complex
eventually the project was dissolved with the decision of the british government to cease funding,complex
babbage 's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to difficulties not only of politics and financing but also to his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow,complex
nevertheless his son henry babbage completed a simplified version of the analytical engine 's computing unit the mill in,complex
he gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in,complex
during the first half of the th century many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation,complex

the z created by german engineer konrad zuse in was one of the earliest examples of an electromechanical relay computer,complex
in zuse followed his earlier machine up with the z the world 's first working electromechanical programmable fully automatic digital computer,complex
the z was built with relays implementing a bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about – hz,complex
program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in words of memory or supplied from the keyboard,complex
it was quite similar to modern machines in some respects pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers,complex
rather than the harder-to-implement decimal system used in charles babbage 's earlier design using a binary system meant that zuse 's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable given the technologies available at that time,complex

the principle of the modern computer was proposed by alan turing in his seminal paper on computable numbers,complex
turing proposed a simple device that he called universal computing machine and that is now known as a universal turing machine,complex
he proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions program stored on tape allowing the machine to be programmable,complex
the fundamental concept of turing 's design is the stored program where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory,complex
von neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper,complex
turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation,complex
except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores modern computers are said to be turing-complete which is to say they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal turing machine,complex
early computing machines had fixed programs,complex
changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine,complex
with the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed,complex
a stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions a program that details the computation,complex
the theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by alan turing in his paper,complex

the bipolar transistor was invented in,complex
from onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs giving rise to the second generation of computers,complex
compared to vacuum tubes transistors have many advantages : they are smaller and require less power than vacuum tubes so give off less heat,complex
silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer indefinite service life,complex
transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space,complex
at the university of manchester a team under the leadership of tom kilburn designed and built a machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves,complex
their first transistorised computer and the first in the world was operational by and a second version was completed there in april,complex
however the machine did make use of valves to generate its khz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory so it was not the first completely transistorized computer,complex

the title president is derived from the latin prae- before sedere to sit,complex
as such it originally designated the officer who presides over or sits before a gathering and ensures that debate is conducted according to the rules of order see also chairman and speaker but today it most commonly refers to an executive official in any social organization,complex
early examples are from the universities of oxford and cambridge from and the founding president of the royal society william brouncker in,complex
this usage survives today in the title of such offices as president of the board of trade and lord president of the council in the united kingdom as well as president of the senate in the united states one of the roles constitutionally assigned to the vice president,complex
the officiating priest at certain anglican religious services too is sometimes called the president in this sense,complex
however the most common modern usage is as the title of a head of state in a republic,complex
in pre-revolutionary france the president of a parlement evolved into a powerful magistrate a member of the so-called noblesse de robe nobility of the gown with considerable judicial as well as administrative authority,complex
the name referred to his primary role of presiding over trials and other hearings,complex
in the th and th centuries seats in the parlements including presidencies became effectively hereditary since the holder of the office could ensure that it would pass to an heir by paying the crown a special tax known as the paulette,complex
the post of first president premier président however could only be held by the king 's nominees,complex
the parlements were abolished by the french revolution,complex
in modern france the chief judge of a court is known as its president président de la cour,complex
the first usage of the word president to denote the highest official in a government was during the commonwealth of england,complex
after the abolition of the monarchy the english council of state whose members were elected by the house of commons became the executive government of the commonwealth,complex
the council of state was the successor of the privy council which had previously been headed by the lord president its successor the council of state was also headed by a lord president the first of which was john bradshaw,complex
however the lord president alone was not head of state because that office was vested in the council as a whole,complex
the modern usage of the term president to designate a single person who is the head of state of a republic can be traced directly to the united states constitution of which created the office of president of the united states,complex
previous american governments had included presidents such as the president of the continental congress or the president of the massachusetts provincial congress but these were presiding officers in the older sense with no executive authority,complex
it has been suggested that the executive use of the term was borrowed from early american colleges and universities which were usually headed by a president,complex
british universities were headed by an official called the chancellor typically a ceremonial position while the chief administrator held the title of vice-chancellor,complex
but america 's first institutions of higher learning such as harvard university and yale university did n't resemble a full-sized university so much as one of its constituent colleges,complex
a number of colleges at cambridge university featured an official called the president,complex
the head for instance of magdalene college cambridge was called the master and his second the president,complex
the first president of harvard henry dunster had been educated at magdalene,complex
some have speculated that he borrowed the term out of a sense of humility considering himself only a temporary place-holder,complex
the presiding official of yale college originally a rector after the usage of continental european universities became president in,complex
a common style of address for presidents mr/mrs,complex
numerous definitions of law have been put forward over the centuries,complex
the third new international dictionary from merriam-webster defines law as : law is a binding custom or practice of a community a rule or mode of conduct or action that is prescribed or formally recognized as binding by a supreme controlling authority or is made obligatory by a sanction as an edict decree rescript order ordinance statute resolution rule judicial decision or usage made recognized or enforced by the controlling authority,complex
the dictionary of the history of ideas published by scribner 's in defined the concept of law accordingly as : a legal system is the most explicit institutionalized and complex mode of regulating human conduct,complex
at the same time it plays only one part in the congeries of rules which influence behavior for social and moral rules of a less institutionalized kind are also of great importance,complex
there have been several attempts to produce a universally acceptable definition of law,complex
in one source indicated that no such definition could be produced,complex
mccoubrey and white said that the question what is law ? has no simple answer,complex
glanville williams said that the meaning of the word law depends on the context in which that word is used,complex
he said that for example early customary law and municipal law were contexts where the word law had two different and irreconcilable meanings,complex
thurman arnold said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word law and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned,complex
it is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word law e,complex

let 's forget about generalities and get down to cases,complex
the history of law links closely to the development of civilization,complex
ancient egyptian law dating as far back as bc contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books,complex
it was based on the concept of ma'at characterised by tradition rhetorical speech social equality and impartiality,complex
by the nd century bc the ancient sumerian ruler ur-nammu had formulated the first law code which consisted of casuistic statements if … then,complex
,complex
around bc king hammurabi further developed babylonian law by codifying and inscribing it in stone,complex
hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of babylon as stelae for the entire public to see this became known as the codex hammurabi,complex
the most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the th century by british assyriologists and has since been fully transliterated and translated into various languages including english italian german and french,complex
the old testament dates back to bc and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society,complex
the small greek city-state ancient athens from about the th century bc was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry excluding women and the slave class,complex
however athens had no legal science or single word for law relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law thémis human decree nomos and custom díkē,complex
yet ancient greek law contained major constitutional innovations in the development of democracy,complex
roman law was heavily influenced by greek philosophy but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated,complex
over the centuries between the rise and decline of the roman empire law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under theodosius ii and justinian i,complex
although codes were replaced by custom and case law during the dark ages roman law was rediscovered around the th century when medieval legal scholars began to research roman codes and adapt their concepts,complex
latin legal maxims called brocards were compiled for guidance,complex
in medieval england royal courts developed a body of precedent which later became the common law,complex
a europe-wide law merchant was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws,complex
the law merchant a precursor to modern commercial law emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property,complex
as nationalism grew in the th and th centuries the law merchant was incorporated into countries ' local law under new civil codes,complex
the napoleonic and german codes became the most influential,complex
in contrast to english common law which consists of enormous tomes of case law codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply,complex
however today there are signs that civil and common law are converging,complex
eu law is codified in treaties but develops through the precedent laid down by the european court of justice,complex
ancient india and china represent distinct traditions of law and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice,complex
the arthashastra probably compiled around ad although it contains older material and the manusmriti c,complex
– ad were foundational treatises in india and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance,complex
manu 's central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism and was cited across southeast asia,complex
this hindu tradition along with islamic law was supplanted by the common law when india became part of the british empire,complex
malaysia brunei singapore and hong kong also adopted the common law,complex
the eastern asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences,complex
japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines by importing bits of the french but mostly the german civil code,complex
this partly reflected germany 's status as a rising power in the late th century,complex
similarly traditional chinese law gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the qing dynasty in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the japanese model of german law,complex
today taiwanese law retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period because of the split between chiang kai-shek 's nationalists who fled there and mao zedong 's communists who won control of the mainland in,complex
the current legal infrastructure in the people 's republic of china was heavily influenced by soviet socialist law which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights,complex
due to rapid industrialisation today china is undergoing a process of reform at least in terms of economic if not social and political rights,complex
a new contract code in represented a move away from administrative domination,complex
furthermore after negotiations lasting fifteen years in china joined the world trade organization,complex

the philosophy of law is commonly known as general jurisprudence,complex
normative jurisprudence asks what should law be ? while analytic jurisprudence asks what is law ? john austin 's utilitarian answer was that law is commands backed by threat of sanctions from a sovereign to whom people have a habit of obedience,complex
natural lawyers on the other side such as jean-jacques rousseau argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature,complex
the concept of natural law emerged in ancient greek philosophy concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice and re-entered the mainstream of western culture through the writings of thomas aquinas notably his treatise on law,complex
hugo grotius the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as aristotle had indicated—and reason,complex
immanuel kant believed a moral imperative requires laws be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature,complex
jeremy bentham and his student austin following david hume believed that this conflated the is and what ought to be problem,complex
bentham and austin argued for law 's positivism that real law is entirely separate from morality,complex
kant was also criticised by friedrich nietzsche who rejected the principle of equality and believed that law emanates from the will to power and can not be labelled as moral or immoral,complex
in the austrian philosopher hans kelsen continued the positivist tradition in his book the pure theory of law,complex
kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality it is endowed with normativity meaning we ought to obey it,complex
while laws are positive is statements e,complex
g,complex
the fine for reversing on a highway is € law tells us what we should do,complex
thus each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm grundnorm instructing us to obey,complex
kelsen 's major opponent carl schmitt rejected both positivism and the idea of the rule of law because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions,complex
therefore schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception state of emergency which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience,complex
later in the th century h,complex
l,complex
a,complex
hart attacked austin for his simplifications and kelsen for his fictions in the concept of law,complex
hart argued law is a system of rules divided into primary rules of conduct and secondary ones rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules,complex
secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication to resolve legal disputes rules of change allowing laws to be varied and the rule of recognition allowing laws to be identified as valid,complex
two of hart 's students continued the debate : in his book law 's empire ronald dworkin attacked hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue,complex
dworkin argues that law is an interpretive concept that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute given their constitutional traditions,complex
joseph raz on the other hand defended the positivist outlook and criticised hart 's soft social thesis approach in the authority of law,complex
raz argues that law is authority identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning,complex
in his view any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to sociology rather than jurisprudence,complex
one definition is that law is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour,complex
in the concept of law hart argued law is a system of rules austin said law was the command of a sovereign backed by the threat of a sanction dworkin describes law as an interpretive concept to achieve justice in his text titled law 's empire and raz argues law is an authority to mediate people 's interests,complex
holmes said the prophecies of what the courts will do in fact and nothing more pretentious are what i mean by the law,complex
in his treatise on law aquinas argues that law is a rational ordering of things which concern the common good that is promulgated by whoever is charged with the care of the community,complex
this definition has both positivist and naturalist elements,complex
in the th century adam smith presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics,complex
the discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and u,complex
a government is the system to govern a state or community,complex
the word government derives ultimately from the greek verb κυβερνάω [ kubernáo ] meaning to steer with gubernaculum rudder the metaphorical sense being attested in plato 's ship of state,complex
the columbia encyclopedia defines government as a system of social control under which the right to make laws and the right to enforce them is vested in a particular group in society,complex
while all types of organizations have governance the word government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately independent national governments on earth as well as their subsidiary organizations,complex
in the commonwealth of nations the word government is also used more narrowly to refer to the ministry collective executive a collective group of people that exercises executive authority in a state or metonymically to the governing cabinet as part of the executive,complex
finally government is also sometimes used in english as a synonym for governance,complex
the moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time however history does record the formations of early governments,complex
about years ago the first small city-states appeared,complex
by the third to second millenniums bc some of these had developed into larger governed areas : sumer ancient egypt the indus valley civilization and the yellow river civilization,complex
the development of agriculture and water control projects were a catalyst for the development of governments,complex
for many thousands of years when people were hunter-gatherers and small scale farmers humans lived in small non-hierarchical and self-sufficient communities,complex
on occasion a chief of a tribe was elected by various rituals or tests of strength to govern his tribe sometimes with a group of elder tribesmen as a council,complex
the human ability to precisely communicate abstract learned information allowed humans to become ever more effective at agriculture and that allowed for ever increasing population densities,complex
david christian explains how this resulted in states with laws and governments : as farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities interactions between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until in a striking parallel with star formation new structures suddenly appeared together with a new level of complexity,complex
like stars cities and states reorganize and energize the smaller objects within their gravitational field,complex
starting at the end of the th century the prevalence of republican forms of government grew,complex
the glorious revolution in england the american revolution and the french revolution contributed to the growth of representative forms of government,complex
the soviet union was the first large country to have a communist government,complex
since the fall of the berlin wall liberal democracy has become an even more prevalent form of government,complex
in the nineteenth and twentieth century there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level,complex
this included the regulation of corporations and the development of the welfare state,complex
,complex
in political science it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of polities as typologies of political systems are not obvious,complex
it is especially important in the political science fields of comparative politics and international relations,complex
like all categories discerned within forms of government the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined,complex
superficially all governments have an official or ideal form,complex
the united states is a constitutional republic while the former soviet union was a socialist republic,complex
however self-identification is not objective and as kopstein and lichbach argue defining regimes can be tricky,complex
for example elections are a defining characteristic of an electoral democracy but in practice elections in the former soviet union were not free and fair and took place in a one-party state,complex
voltaire argued that the holy roman empire is neither holy nor roman nor an empire,complex
many governments that officially call themselves a democratic republic are not democratic nor a republic they are usually a dictatorship de facto,complex
communist dictatorships have been especially prone to use this term,complex
for example the official name of north vietnam was the democratic republic of vietnam,complex
china uses a variant the people 's republic of china,complex
thus in many practical classifications it would not be considered democratic,complex
identifying a form of government is also difficult because many political systems originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by parties naming themselves after those movements all with competing political-ideologies,complex
experience with those movements in power and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves,complex
other complications include general non-consensus or deliberate distortion or bias of reasonable technical definitions to political ideologies and associated forms of governing due to the nature of politics in the modern era,complex
for example : the meaning of conservatism in the united states has little in common with the way the word 's definition is used elsewhere,complex
as ribuffo notes what americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism,complex
since the s conservatism in the united states has been chiefly associated with the republican party,complex
however during the era of segregation many southern democrats were conservatives and they played a key role in the conservative coalition that controlled congress from to,complex
every country in the world is ruled by a system of governance that combines at least three or more political or economic attributes,complex
additionally opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist,complex
shades of gray are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification,complex
even the most liberal democracies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most tyrannical dictatorships must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for pigeonholing governments into narrow categories,complex
examples include the claims of the united states as being a plutocracy rather than a democracy since some american voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy super pacs,complex
the classical greek philosopher plato discusses five types of regimes : aristocracy timocracy oligarchy democracy and tyranny,complex
plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for,complex
the tyrannical man would represent tyranny for example,complex
these five regimes progressively degenerate starting with aristocracy at the top and tyranny at the bottom,complex
one method of classifying governments is through which people have the authority to rule,complex
this can either be one person an autocracy such as monarchy a select group of people an aristocracy or the people as a whole a democracy such as a republic,complex
the division of governments as monarchy aristocracy and democracy has been used since aristotle 's politics,complex
in his book leviathan thomas hobbes expands on this classification,complex
the difference of commonwealths consisteth in the difference of the sovereign or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude,complex
and because the sovereignty is either in one man or in an assembly of more than one and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter or not every one but certain men distinguished from the rest it is manifest there can be but three kinds of commonwealth,complex
for the representative must needs be one man or more and if more then it is the assembly of all or but of a part,complex
when the representative is one man then is the commonwealth a monarchy when an assembly of all that will come together then it is a democracy or popular commonwealth when an assembly of a part only then it is called an aristocracy,complex
other kind of commonwealth there can be none : for either one or more or all must have the sovereign power which i have shown to be indivisible entire,complex
an autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection,complex
a despotism is a government ruled by a single entity with absolute power whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control except perhaps for implicit threat,complex
that entity may be an individual as in an autocracy or it may be a group as in an oligarchy,complex
the word despotism means to rule in the fashion of despots,complex
a monarchy is where a family or group of families rarely another type of group called the royalty represents national identity with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals called the monarch who mostly rule kingdoms,complex
the actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical crowned republic to partial and restricted constitutional monarchy to completely despotic absolute monarchy,complex
traditionally and in most cases the post of the monarch is inherited but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected,complex
the use of prisons can be traced back to the rise of the state as a form of social organization,complex
corresponding with the advent of the state was the development of written language which enabled the creation of formalized legal codes as official guidelines for society,complex
the best known of these early legal codes is the code of hammurabi written in babylon around bc,complex
the penalties for violations of the laws in hammurabi 's code were almost exclusively centered on the concept of lex talionis the law of retaliation whereby people were punished as a form of vengeance often by the victims themselves,complex
this notion of punishment as vengeance or retaliation can also be found in many other legal codes from early civilizations including the ancient sumerian codes the indian manama dharma astra the hermes trismegistus of egypt and the israelite mosaic law,complex
some ancient greek philosophers such as plato began to develop ideas of using punishment to reform offenders instead of simply using it as retribution,complex
imprisonment as a penalty was used initially for those who could not afford to pay their fines,complex
eventually since impoverished athenians could not pay their fines leading to indefinite periods of imprisonment time limits were set instead,complex
the prison in ancient athens was known as the desmoterion place of chains,complex
the romans were among the first to use prisons as a form of punishment rather than simply for detention,complex
a variety of existing structures were used to house prisoners such as metal cages basements of public buildings and quarries,complex
one of the most notable roman prisons was the mamertine prison established around b,complex
c,complex
by ancus marcius,complex
the mamertine prison was located within a sewer system beneath ancient rome and contained a large network of dungeons where prisoners were held in squalid conditions contaminated with human waste,complex
forced labor on public works projects was also a common form of punishment,complex
in many cases citizens were sentenced to slavery often in ergastula a primitive form of prison where unruly slaves were chained to workbenches and performed hard labor,complex
during the middle ages in europe castles fortresses and the basements of public buildings were often used as makeshift prisons,complex
the possession of the right and the capability to imprison citizens however granted an air of legitimacy to officials at all levels of government from kings to regional courts to city councils and the ability to have someone imprisoned or killed served as a signifier of who in society possessed power or authority over others,complex
another common punishment was sentencing people to galley slavery which involved chaining prisoners together in the bottoms of ships and forcing them to row on naval or merchant vessels,complex
from the late th century and during the th century popular resistance to public execution and torture became more widespread both in europe and in the united states,complex
particularly under the bloody code with few sentencing alternatives imposition of the death penalty for petty crimes such as theft was proving increasingly unpopular with the public many jurors were refusing to convict defendants of petty crimes when they knew the defendants would be sentenced to death,complex
rulers began looking for means to punish and control their subjects in a way that did not cause people to associate them with spectacles of tyrannical and sadistic violence,complex
they developed systems of mass incarceration often with hard labor as a solution,complex
the prison reform movement that arose at this time was heavily influenced by two somewhat contradictory philosophies,complex
the first was based in enlightenment ideas of utilitarianism and rationalism and suggested that prisons should simply be used as a more effective substitute for public corporal punishments such as whipping hanging etc,complex
this theory referred to as deterrence claims that the primary purpose of prisons is to be so harsh and terrifying that they deter people from committing crimes out of fear of going to prison,complex
the second theory which saw prisons as a form of rehabilitation or moral reform was based on religious ideas that equated crime with sin and saw prisons as a place to instruct prisoners in christian morality obedience and proper behavior,complex
these later reformers believed that prisons could be constructed as humane institutions of moral instruction and that prisoners ' behavior could be corrected so that when they were released they would be model members of society,complex
the concept of the modern prison largely remained unknown until the early th-century,complex
punishment usually consisted of physical forms of punishment including capital punishment mutilation flagellation whipping branding and non-physical punishments such as public shaming rituals like the stocks,complex
from the middle ages up to the th and th centuries in europe imprisonment was rarely used as a punishment in its own right and prisons were mainly to hold those awaiting trial and convicts awaiting punishment,complex
however an important innovation at the time was the bridewell house of corrections located at bridewell palace in london which resulted in the building of other houses of correction,complex
these houses held mostly petty offenders vagrants and the disorderly local poor,complex
in these facilities inmates were given jobs and through prison labor they were taught how to work for a living,complex
by the end of the th century houses of correction were absorbed into local prison facilities under the control of the local justice of the peace,complex
england used penal transportation of convicted criminals and others generally young and poor for a term of indentured servitude within the general population of british america between the s and,complex
the transportation act made this option available for lesser crimes or offered it by discretion as a longer-term alternative to the death penalty which could theoretically be imposed for the growing number of offenses,complex
the substantial expansion of transportation was the first major innovation in eighteenth-century british penal practice,complex
transportation to america was abruptly suspended by the criminal law act geo,complex
c,complex
with the start of the american rebellion,complex
while sentencing to transportation continued the act instituted a punishment policy of hard labour instead,complex
the suspension of transport also prompted the use of prisons for punishment and the initial start of a prison building program,complex
britain would resume transportation to specifically planned penal colonies in australia between and,complex
gaols at the time were run as business ventures and contained both felons and debtors the latter were often housed with their wives and younger children,complex
the gaolers made their money by charging the inmates for food drink and other services and the system was generally corruptible,complex
one reform of the seventeenth century was the establishment of the london bridewell as a house of correction for women and children,complex
it was the first facility to make any medical services available to prisoners,complex
with the widely used alternative of penal transportation halted in the s the immediate need for additional penal accommodations emerged,complex
given the undeveloped institutional facilities old sailing vessels termed hulks were the most readily available and expandable choice to be used as places of temporary confinement,complex
while conditions on these ships were generally appalling their use and the labor thus provided set a precedent which persuaded many people that mass incarceration and labour were viable methods of crime prevention and punishment,complex
medicine uk : listen us : listen is the science and practice of the diagnosis treatment and prevention of disease,complex
the word medicine is derived from latin medicus meaning a physician,complex
medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology,complex
modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the western world while in developing countries such as parts of africa or asia the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners,complex
even in the developed world however evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice for example a survey of literature reviews found that about of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm,complex
in modern clinical practice physicians personally assess patients in order to diagnose treat and prevent disease using clinical judgment,complex
the doctor-patient relationship typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient 's medical history and medical record followed by a medical interview and a physical examination,complex
basic diagnostic medical devices e,complex

stethoscope tongue depressor are typically used,complex
after examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms the doctor may order medical tests e,complex
g,complex
blood tests take a biopsy or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies,complex
differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided,complex
during the encounter properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust,complex
the medical encounter is then documented in the medical record which is a legal document in many jurisdictions,complex
follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure and specialists follow a similar process,complex
the diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue,complex
the components of the medical interview and encounter are : chief complaint cc : the reason for the current medical visit,complex
these are the 'symptoms,complex
' they are in the patient 's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one,complex
also called 'chief concern ' or 'presenting complaint ',complex
history of present illness hpi : the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom,complex
distinguishable from history of previous illness often called past medical history pmh,complex
medical history comprises hpi and pmh,complex
current activity : occupation hobbies what the patient actually does,complex
medications rx : what drugs the patient takes including prescribed over-the-counter and home remedies as well as alternative and herbal medicines/herbal remedies,complex
allergies are also recorded,complex
past medical history pmh/pmhx : concurrent medical problems past hospitalizations and operations injuries past infectious diseases or vaccinations history of known allergies,complex
social history sh : birthplace residences marital history social and economic status habits including diet medications tobacco alcohol,complex
family history fh : listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient,complex
a family tree is sometimes used,complex
review of systems ros or systems inquiry : a set of additional questions to ask which may be missed on hpi : a general enquiry have you noticed any weight loss change in sleep quality fevers lumps and bumps ? etc,complex
followed by questions on the body 's main organ systems heart lungs digestive tract urinary tract etc,complex

it is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above,complex
the treatment plan may include ordering additional medical laboratory tests and medical imaging studies starting therapy referral to a specialist or watchful observation,complex
follow-up may be advised,complex
depending upon the health insurance plan and the managed care system various forms of utilization review such as prior authorization of tests may place barriers on accessing expensive services,complex
the medical decision-making mdm process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses the differential diagnoses along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient 's problem,complex
on subsequent visits the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history symptoms physical findings and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations,complex
contemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems,complex
legal credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments augmented on occasion by international organizations such as churches,complex
the characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided,complex
from ancient times christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the catholic church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world,complex
advanced industrial countries with the exception of the united states and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system or compulsory private or co-operative health insurance,complex
this is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay,complex
delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics or by charities most commonly by a combination of all three,complex
most tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole,complex
in such societies healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it either directly or as part of an employment contract or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly,complex
transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system,complex
access to information on conditions treatments quality and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and therefore the incentives of medical professionals,complex
while the us healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness new legislation may encourage greater openness,complex
there is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other,complex
provision of medical care is classified into primary secondary and tertiary care categories,complex
primary care medical services are provided by physicians physician assistants nurse practitioners or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care,complex
these occur in physician offices clinics nursing homes schools home visits and other places close to patients,complex
about of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider,complex
these include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes,complex
secondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient,complex
referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists,complex
these include both ambulatory care and inpatient services emergency departments intensive care medicine surgery services physical therapy labor and delivery endoscopy units diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services hospice centers etc,complex
in many cases terms such as disease disorder morbidity sickness and illness are used interchangeably,complex
there are situations however when specific terms are considered preferable,complex
disease the term disease broadly refers to any condition that impairs the normal functioning of the body,complex
for this reason diseases are associated with dysfunctioning of the body 's normal homeostatic processes,complex
commonly the term is used to refer specifically to infectious diseases which are clinically evident diseases that result from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents including viruses bacteria fungi protozoa multicellular organisms and aberrant proteins known as prions,complex
an infection or colonization that does not and will not produce clinically evident impairment of normal functioning such as the presence of the normal bacteria and yeasts in the gut or of a passenger virus is not considered a disease,complex
by contrast an infection that is asymptomatic during its incubation period but expected to produce symptoms later is usually considered a disease,complex
non-infectious diseases are all other diseases including most forms of cancer heart disease and genetic disease,complex
acquired disease an acquired disease is one that began at some point during one 's lifetime as opposed to disease that was already present at birth which is congenital disease,complex
acquired sounds like it could mean caught via contagion but it simply means acquired sometime after birth,complex
it also sounds like it could imply secondary disease but acquired disease can be primary disease,complex
acute disease an acute disease is one of a short-term nature acute the term sometimes also connotes a fulminant nature chronic condition or chronic disease a chronic disease is one that persists over time often characterized six months or more,complex
congenital disorder or congenital disease a congenital disorder is one that is present at birth,complex
it is often a genetic disease or disorder and can be inherited,complex
it can also be the result of a vertically transmitted infection from the mother such as hiv/aids,complex
genetic disease a genetic disorder or disease is caused by one or more genetic mutations,complex
it is often inherited but some mutations are random and de novo,complex
hereditary or inherited disease a hereditary disease is a type of genetic disease caused by genetic mutations that are hereditary and can run in families iatrogenic disease an iatrogenic disease or condition is one that caused by medical intervention whether as a side effect of a treatment or as an inadvertent outcome,complex
idiopathic disease an idiopathic disease has an unknown cause or source,complex
as medical science has advanced many diseases with entirely unknown causes have had some aspects of their sources explained and therefore shed their idiopathic status,complex
for example when germs were discovered it became known that they were a cause of infection but particular germs and diseases had not been linked,complex
in another example it is known that autoimmunity is the cause of some forms of diabetes mellitus type even though the particular molecular pathways by which it works are not yet understood,complex
it is also common to know certain factors are associated with certain diseases,complex
however association and causality are two very different phenomena as a third cause might be producing the disease as well as an associated phenomenon,complex
incurable disease a disease that can not be cured,complex
incurable diseases are not necessarily terminal diseases and sometimes a disease 's symptoms can be treated sufficiently for the disease to have little or no impact on quality of life,complex
primary disease a primary disease is a disease that is due to a root cause of illness as opposed to secondary disease which is a sequela or complication that is caused by the primary disease,complex
for example a common cold is a primary disease where rhinitis is a possible secondary disease or sequela,complex
a doctor must determine what primary disease a cold or a bacterial infection is causing a patient 's secondary rhinitis when deciding whether or not to prescribe antibiotics,complex
secondary disease a secondary disease is a disease that is a sequela or complication of a prior causal disease which is referred to as the primary disease or simply the underlying cause root cause,complex
for example a bacterial infection can be primary wherein a healthy person is exposed to a bacteria and becomes infected or it can be secondary to a primary cause that predisposes the body to infection,complex
for example a primary viral infection that weakens the immune system could lead to a secondary bacterial infection,complex
similarly a primary burn that creates an open wound could provide an entry point for bacteria and lead to a secondary bacterial infection,complex
terminal disease a terminal disease is one that is expected to have the inevitable result of death,complex
previously aids was a terminal disease it is now incurable but can be managed indefinitely using medications,complex
illness the terms illness and sickness are both generally used as a synonym for disease,complex
however the term illness is occasionally used to refer specifically to the patient 's personal experience of his or her disease,complex
in this model it is possible for a person to have a disease without being ill to have an objectively definable but asymptomatic medical condition such as a subclinical infection and to be ill without being diseased such as when a person perceives a normal experience as a medical condition or medicalizes a non-disease situation in his or her life—for example a person who feels unwell as a result of embarrassment and who interprets those feelings as sickness rather than normal emotions,complex
symptoms of illness are often not directly the result of infection but a collection of evolved responses—sickness behavior by the body—that helps clear infection and promote recovery,complex
such aspects of illness can include lethargy depression loss of appetite sleepiness hyperalgesia and inability to concentrate,complex
disorder a disorder is a functional abnormality or disturbance,complex
medical disorders can be categorized into mental disorders physical disorders genetic disorders emotional and behavioral disorders and functional disorders,complex
the term disorder is often considered more value-neutral and less stigmatizing than the terms disease or illness and therefore is a preferred terminology in some circumstances,complex
in mental health the term mental disorder is used as a way of acknowledging the complex interaction of biological social and psychological factors in psychiatric conditions,complex
however the term disorder is also used in many other areas of medicine primarily to identify physical disorders that are not caused by infectious organisms such as metabolic disorders,complex
medical condition a medical condition is a broad term that includes all diseases lesions disorders or nonpathologic condition that normally receives medical treatment such as pregnancy or childbirth,complex
while the term medical condition generally includes mental illnesses in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness injury or disease except for mental illnesses,complex
the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all mental disorders uses the term general medical condition to refer to all diseases illnesses and injuries except for mental disorders,complex
there is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed but some information has been inferred by studying lice which estimates the introduction of clothing at roughly – years ago,complex
the most obvious function of clothing is to improve the comfort of the wearer by protecting the wearer from the elements,complex
in hot climates clothing provides protection from sunburn or wind damage while in cold climates its thermal insulation properties are generally more important,complex
shelter usually reduces the functional need for clothing,complex
for example coats hats gloves and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm home particularly if one is living or sleeping there,complex
similarly clothing has seasonal and regional aspects so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones,complex
clothing performs a range of social and cultural functions such as individual occupational and gender differentiation and social status,complex
in many societies norms about clothing reflect standards of modesty religion gender and social status,complex
clothing may also function as a form of adornment and an expression of personal taste or style,complex
clothing can be and has in the past been made from a very wide variety of materials,complex
materials have ranged from leather and furs to woven materials to elaborate and exotic natural and synthetic fabrics,complex
not all body coverings are regarded as clothing,complex
articles carried rather than worn such as purses worn on a single part of the body and easily removed scarves worn purely for adornment jewelry or those that serve a function other than protection eyeglasses are normally considered accessories rather than clothing except for shoes,complex
clothing protects against many things that might injure the uncovered human body,complex
clothes protect people from the elements including rain snow wind and other weather as well as from the sun,complex
however clothing that is too sheer thin small tight etc,complex
offers less protection,complex
appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport,complex
some clothing protects from specific hazards such as insects noxious chemicals weather weapons and contact with abrasive substances,complex
the japanese word for japan is 日本 which is pronounced nihon or nippon and literally means the origin of the sun,complex
the character nichi 日 means sun or day hon 本 means base or origin,complex
the compound therefore means origin of the sun and is the source of the popular western epithet land of the rising sun,complex
the earliest record of the name nihon appears in the chinese historical records of the tang dynasty the old book of tang,complex
at the end of the seventh century a delegation from japan requested that nihon be used as the name of their country,complex
this name may have its origin in a letter sent in and recorded in the official history of the sui dynasty,complex
prince shōtoku the regent of japan sent a mission to china with a letter in which he called himself the emperor of the land where the sun rises 日出處天子,complex
the message said : here i the emperor of the country where the sun rises send a letter to the emperor of the country where the sun sets,complex
how are you [ ? ],complex
prior to the adoption of nihon other terms such as yamato 大和 or great wa and wakoku 倭国 were used,complex
the term wa 和 is a homophone of wo 倭 pronounced wa by the japanese which has been used by the chinese as a designation for the japanese as early as the third century three kingdoms period,complex
another form of wa 委 wei in chinese was used for an early state in japan called nakoku during the han dynasty,complex
however the japanese disliked some connotation of wa 倭 which has been associated in china with concepts like dwarf or pygmy and it was therefore replaced with the substitute character wa 和 meaning togetherness harmony,complex
the english word japan possibly derives from the historical chinese pronunciation of 日本,complex
the old mandarin or possibly early wu chinese pronunciation of japan was recorded by marco polo as cipangu,complex
in modern shanghainese a wu dialect the pronunciation of characters 日本 japan is zeppen [ zəʔpən ],complex
the old malay word for japan japun or japang was borrowed from a southern coastal chinese dialect probably fukienese or ningpo – and this malay word was encountered by portuguese traders in southeast asia in the th century,complex
these early portuguese traders then brought the word to europe,complex
the first record of this name in english is in a book published in and spelled giapan in a translation of a letter written by a portuguese jesuit luís fróis,complex
from the meiji restoration until the end of world war ii the full title of japan was dai nippon teikoku 大日本帝國 meaning the empire of great japan,complex
today the name nihon-koku/nippon-koku 日本国 is used as a formal modern-day equivalent with the meaning of the state of japan,complex
countries like japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given a name appended by the character koku 国 meaning country nation or state,complex
,complex
a paleolithic culture around bc constitutes the first known habitation of the japanese archipelago,complex
this was followed from around bc the start of the jōmon period by a mesolithic to neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture including by ancestors of contemporary ainu people and yamato people,complex
decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world,complex
around bc the yayoi people began to enter the japanese islands intermingling with the jōmon,complex
the yayoi period starting around bc saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming a new style of pottery and metallurgy introduced from china and korea,complex
japan first appears in written history in the chinese book of han,complex
according to the records of the three kingdoms the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the third century was called yamataikoku,complex
buddhism was introduced to japan from baekje korea and was promoted by prince shōtoku but the subsequent development of japanese buddhism was primarily influenced by china,complex
despite early resistance buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the asuka period –,complex
the nara period – marked an emergence of the centralized japanese state centered on the imperial court in heijō-kyō modern nara,complex
the nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of buddhist-inspired art and architecture,complex
the smallpox epidemic of – is believed to have killed as much as one-third of japan 's population,complex
in emperor kanmu moved the capital from nara to nagaoka-kyō then to heian-kyō modern kyoto in,complex
this marked the beginning of the heian period – during which a distinctly indigenous japanese culture emerged noted for its art poetry and prose,complex
murasaki shikibu 's the tale of genji and the lyrics of japan 's national anthem kimigayo were written during this time,complex
buddhism began to spread during the heian era chiefly through two major sects tendai by saichō and shingon by kūkai,complex
pure land buddhism jōdo-shū jōdo shinshū became greatly popular in the latter half of the th century,complex
japan 's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors the samurai,complex
in following the defeat of the taira clan in the genpei war sung in the epic tale of heike samurai minamoto no yoritomo was appointed shōgun by emperor go-toba and yoritomo established a base of power in kamakura,complex
after his death the hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shōguns,complex
the zen school of buddhism was introduced from china in the kamakura period – and became popular among the samurai class,complex
the kamakura shogunate repelled mongol invasions in and but was eventually overthrown by emperor go-daigo,complex
emperor go-daigo was himself defeated by ashikaga takauji in,complex
ashikaga takauji established the shogunate in muromachi kyoto,complex
this was the start of the muromachi period –,complex
the ashikaga shogunate achieved glory at the age of ashikaga yoshimitsu and the culture based on zen buddhism the art of miyabi prospered,complex
this evolved to higashiyama culture and prospered until the th century,complex
on the other hand the succeeding ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords daimyōs and a civil war the ōnin war began in opening the century-long sengoku period warring states,complex
during the th century traders and jesuit missionaries from portugal reached japan for the first time initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between japan and the west,complex
this allowed oda nobunaga to obtain european technology and firearms which he used to conquer many other daimyōs,complex
his consolidation of power began what was known as the azuchi–momoyama period –,complex
after nobunaga was assassinated in by akechi mitsuhide his successor toyotomi hideyoshi unified the nation in and launched two unsuccessful invasions of korea in and,complex
tokugawa ieyasu served as regent for hideyoshi 's son and used his position to gain political and military support,complex
when open war broke out ieyasu defeated rival clans in the battle of sekigahara in,complex
tokugawa ieyasu was appointed shōgun by emperor go-yōzei in and established the tokugawa shogunate in edo modern tokyo,complex
the shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyōs and in the isolationist sakoku closed country policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the edo period –,complex
the study of western sciences known as rangaku continued through contact with the dutch enclave at dejima in nagasaki,complex
the edo period also gave rise to kokugaku national studies the study of japan by the japanese,complex
on march commodore matthew perry and the black ships of the united states navy forced the opening of japan to the outside world with the convention of kanagawa,complex
subsequent similar treaties with western countries in the bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises,complex
the resignation of the shōgun led to the boshin war and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor the meiji restoration,complex
plunging itself through an active process of westernization during the meiji restoration in japan adopted western political judicial and military institutions and western cultural influences integrated with its traditional culture for modern industrialization,complex
the cabinet organized the privy council introduced the meiji constitution and assembled the imperial diet,complex
the meiji restoration transformed the empire of japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence,complex
although france and britain showed some interest the european powers largely ignored japan and instead concentrated on the much greater attractions of china,complex
france was also set back by its failures in mexico and defeat by the germans,complex
after victories in the first sino-japanese war – and the russo-japanese war – japan gained control of taiwan korea and the southern half of sakhalin,complex
in addition to imperialistic success japan also invested much more heavily in its own economic growth leading to a period of economic flourishing in the country which lasted until the great depression,complex
japan 's population grew from million in to million in,complex
in world war i japan joined the allies and captured german possessions and made advances into china,complex
the early th century saw a period of taishō democracy – but the s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards statism the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups,complex
this process accelerated during the s spawning a number of new radical nationalist groups which shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in asia,complex
japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism reshaped the country,complex
in japan invaded and occupied manchuria and following international condemnation of this occupation it quit the league of nations in,complex
in japan signed the anti-comintern pact with germany and the tripartite pact made it one of the axis powers,complex
the empire of japan invaded other parts of china in precipitating the second sino-japanese war –,complex
the imperial japanese army swiftly captured the capital nanjing and conducted the nanking massacre,complex
in the empire invaded french indochina after which the united states placed an oil embargo on japan,complex
on december – japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on pearl harbor british forces in malaya singapore and hong kong and declared war on the united states and the british empire bringing the united states and the united kingdom into world war ii in the pacific,complex
after allied victories across the pacific during the next four years which culminated in the soviet invasion of manchuria and the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on august,complex
the war cost japan its colonies china and the war 's other combatants tens of millions of lives and left much of japan 's industry and infrastructure destroyed,complex
the allies led by the united states repatriated millions of ethnic japanese from colonies and military camps throughout asia largely eliminating the japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories,complex
the allies also convened the international military tribunal for the far east on may to prosecute some senior generals for war crimes,complex
in japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices,complex
the allied occupation ended with the treaty of san francisco in and japan was granted membership in the united nations in,complex
japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world until surpassed by china in,complex
this ended in the mid-s when japan suffered a major recession,complex
in the beginning of the st century positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery,complex
on march japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history this triggered the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power,complex
japan has a total of islands extending along the pacific coast,complex
the middle ages is one of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme for analysing european history : classical civilisation or antiquity the middle ages and the modern period,complex
medieval writers divided history into periods such as the six ages or the four empires and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world,complex
when referring to their own times they spoke of them as being modern,complex
in the s the humanist and poet petrarch referred to pre-christian times as antiqua or ancient and to the christian period as nova or new,complex
leonardo bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his history of the florentine people,complex
bruni and later historians argued that italy had recovered since petrarch 's time and therefore added a third period to petrarch 's two,complex
the middle ages first appears in latin in as media tempestas or middle season,complex
in early usage there were many variants including medium aevum or middle age first recorded in and media saecula or middle ages first recorded in,complex
the alternative term medieval or occasionally mediaeval or mediæval derives from medium aevum,complex
tripartite periodisation became standard after the german th-century historian christoph cellarius divided history into three periods : ancient medieval and modern,complex
the most commonly given starting point for the middle ages is around with the date of first used by bruni,complex
later starting dates are sometimes used in the outer parts of europe,complex
for europe as a whole is often considered to be the end of the middle ages but there is no universally agreed upon end date,complex
depending on the context events such as the conquest of constantinople by the turks in christopher columbus 's first voyage to the americas in or the protestant reformation in are sometimes used,complex
english historians often use the battle of bosworth field in to mark the end of the period,complex
for spain dates commonly used are the death of king ferdinand ii in the death of queen isabella i of castile in or the conquest of granada in,complex
historians from romance-speaking countries tend to divide the middle ages into two parts : an earlier high and later low period,complex
english-speaking historians following their german counterparts generally subdivide the middle ages into three intervals : early high and late,complex
in the th century the entire middle ages were often referred to as the dark ages but with the adoption of these subdivisions use of this term was restricted to the early middle ages at least among historians,complex
the roman empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the nd century ad the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of roman control over its outlying territories,complex
economic issues including inflation and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the crisis of the third century with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers,complex
military expenses increased steadily during the rd century mainly in response to the war with the sasanian empire which revived in the middle of the rd century,complex
the army doubled in size and cavalry and smaller units replaced the roman legion as the main tactical unit,complex
the need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial or landowning class and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns,complex
more bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers,complex
the emperor diocletian r,complex
– split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other,complex
in after a period of civil war constantine the great r,complex
– refounded the city of byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital constantinople,complex
diocletian 's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy reformed taxation and strengthened the army which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing : excessive taxation a declining birthrate and pressures on its frontiers among others,complex
civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the th century diverting soldiers from the empire 's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach,complex
for much of the th century roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period with a widening gulf between the rich and poor and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns,complex
another change was the christianisation or conversion of the empire to christianity a gradual process that lasted from the nd to the th centuries,complex
in the goths fleeing from the huns received permission from emperor valens r,complex
– to settle in the roman province of thracia in the balkans,complex
the settlement did not go smoothly and when roman officials mishandled the situation the goths began to raid and plunder,complex
valens attempting to put down the disorder was killed fighting the goths at the battle of adrianople on august,complex
as well as the threat from such tribal confederacies from the north internal divisions within the empire especially within the christian church caused problems,complex
in the visigoths invaded the western roman empire and although briefly forced back from italy in sacked the city of rome,complex
in the alans vandals and suevi crossed into gaul over the next three years they spread across gaul and in crossed the pyrenees mountains into modern-day spain,complex
the migration period began when various peoples initially largely germanic peoples moved across europe,complex
the franks alemanni and the burgundians all ended up in northern gaul while the angles saxons and jutes settled in britain and the vandals went on to cross the strait of gibraltar after which they conquered the province of africa,complex
in the s the huns began invading the empire their king attila r,complex
– led invasions into the balkans in and gaul in and italy in,complex
the hunnic threat remained until attila 's death in when the hunnic confederation he led fell apart,complex
these invasions by the tribes completely changed the political and demographic nature of what had been the western roman empire,complex
by the end of the th century the western section of the empire was divided into smaller political units ruled by the tribes that had invaded in the early part of the century,complex
the deposition of the last emperor of the west romulus augustulus in has traditionally marked the end of the western roman empire,complex
by the italian peninsula was conquered by the ostrogoths,complex
the eastern roman empire often referred to as the byzantine empire after the fall of its western counterpart had little ability to assert control over the lost western territories,complex
the byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory but while none of the new kings in the west dared to elevate himself to the position of emperor of the west byzantine control of most of the western empire could not be sustained the reconquest of the mediterranean periphery and the italian peninsula gothic war in the reign of justinian r,complex
– was the sole and temporary exception,complex
,complex
the political structure of western europe changed with the end of the united roman empire,complex
although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as invasions they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire,complex
such movements were aided by the refusal of the western roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration,complex
the emperors of the th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as stilicho d,complex
aetius d,complex
aspar d,complex
ricimer d,complex
or gundobad d,complex
who were partly or fully of non-roman background,complex
when the line of western emperors ceased many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background,complex
the word animal comes from the latin animalis meaning having breath having soul or living being,complex
the biological definition includes all members of the kingdom animalia,complex
in colloquial usage as a consequence of anthropocentrism the term animal is sometimes used nonscientifically to refer only to non-human animals,complex
animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things,complex
animals are eukaryotic and multicellular unlike bacteria which are prokaryotic and unlike protists which are eukaryotic but unicellular,complex
unlike plants and algae which produce their own nutrients animals are heterotrophic feeding on organic material and digesting it internally,complex
with very few exceptions animals breathe oxygen and respire aerobically,complex
all animals are motile able to spontaneously move their bodies during at least part of their life cycle but some animals such as sponges corals mussels and barnacles later become sessile,complex
the blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to most animals allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs,complex
all animals are composed of cells surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins,complex
during development the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised making the formation of complex structures possible,complex
this may be calcified forming structures such as shells bones and spicules,complex
in contrast the cells of other multicellular organisms primarily algae plants and fungi are held in place by cell walls and so develop by progressive growth,complex
animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions gap junctions and desmosomes,complex
with few exceptions—in particular the sponges and placozoans—animal bodies are differentiated into tissues,complex
these include muscles which enable locomotion and nerve tissues which transmit signals and coordinate the body,complex
typically there is also an internal digestive chamber with either one opening as in flatworms or two openings as in deuterostomes,complex
nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction,complex
they produce haploid gametes by meiosis the smaller motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger non-motile gametes are ova,complex
these fuse to form zygotes which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere called a blastula,complex
in its most narrow usage fiction refers to novels but it may also denote any literary narrative see literary fiction including novels novellas and short stories,complex
more broadly fiction has come to encompass imaginative storytelling in any format including writings theatrical performances comics films television programs animations games most notably video games and role-playing games and so on,complex
a work of fiction implies the inventive act of constructing an imaginary world so its audience does not typically expect it to be totally faithful to the real world in presenting only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true,complex
instead the context of fiction generally understood as not adhering precisely to the real world is more open to interpretation,complex
characters and events within a fictional work may even be set in their own context entirely separate from the known universe : an independent fictional universe,complex
fiction 's traditional opposite is non-fiction a narrative work whose creator assumes responsibility for presenting only the historical and factual truth,complex
the distinction between fiction and non-fiction however can be unclear in some recent artistic and literary movements such as postmodern literature,complex
traditionally fiction includes novels short stories fables legends myths fairy tales epic and narrative poetry plays including operas musicals dramas puppet plays and various kinds of theatrical dances,complex
however fiction may also encompass comic books and many animated cartoons stop motions anime manga films video games radio programs television programs comedies and dramas etc,complex
the internet has had a major impact on the creation and distribution of fiction calling into question the feasibility of copyright as a means to ensure royalties are paid to copyright holders,complex
also digital libraries such as project gutenberg make public domain texts more readily available,complex
the combination of inexpensive home computers the internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction such as interactive computer games or computer-generated comics,complex
countless forums for fan fiction can be found online where loyal followers of specific fictional realms create and distribute derivative stories,complex
the internet is also used for the development of blog fiction where a story is delivered through a blog either as flash fiction or serial blog and collaborative fiction where a story is written sequentially by different authors or the entire text can be revised by anyone using a wiki,complex
types of literary fiction in prose include : short story : a work of at least words but under words,complex
the boundary between a long short story and a novella is vague,complex
novella : a work of at least words but under words,complex
joseph conrad 's heart of darkness is an example of a novella,complex
novel : a work of words or more,complex
fiction is commonly broken down into a variety of genres : subsets of fiction each differentiated by a particular unifying tone or style narrative technique media content or popularly defined criterion,complex
science fiction for example predicts or supposes technologies that are not realities at the time of the work 's creation : jules verne 's novel from the earth to the moon was published in and only in did astronaut neil armstrong first land on the moon,complex
historical fiction places imaginary characters into real historical events,complex
in the early historical novel waverley sir walter scott 's fictional character edward waverley meets a figure from history bonnie prince charlie and takes part in the battle of prestonpans,complex
some works of fiction are slightly or greatly re-imagined based on some originally true story or a reconstructed biography,complex
often even when the fictional story is based on fact there may be additions and subtractions from the true story to make it more interesting,complex
an example is tim o'brien 's the things they carried a series of short stories about the vietnam war,complex
fictional works that explicitly involve supernatural magical or scientifically impossible elements are often classified under the genre of fantasy including lewis carroll 's alice in wonderland j,complex
k,complex
rowling 's harry potter series and j,complex
r,complex
r,complex
tolkien 's the lord of the rings,complex
creators of fantasy sometimes introduce imaginary creatures and beings such as dragons and fairies,complex
literary fiction is a term used in the book-trade to distinguish novels that are regarded as having literary merit from most commercial or genre fiction,complex
neal stephenson has suggested that while any definition will be simplistic there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction,complex
on the one hand literary authors nowadays are frequently supported by patronage with employment at a university or a similar institution and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics,complex
on the other hand he suggests genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales,complex
however in an interview john updike lamented that the category of 'literary fiction ' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books and if anybody wanted to read them terrific the more the merrier,complex

i 'm a genre writer of a sort,complex
i write literary fiction which is like spy fiction or chick lit,complex
likewise on the charlie rose show he argued that this term when applied to his work greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing so he does not really like it,complex
he suggested that all his works are literary simply because they are written in words,complex
literary fiction often involves social commentary political criticism or reflection on the human condition,complex
in general it focuses on introspective in-depth character studies of interesting complex and developed characters,complex
this contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern,complex
usually in literary fiction the focus is on the inner story of the characters who drive the plot with detailed motivations to elicit emotional involvement in the reader,complex
the style of literary fiction is often described as elegantly written lyrical and,complex
layered,complex
the tone of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction while the pacing of literary fiction may be slower than popular fiction,complex
as terrence rafferty notes literary fiction by its nature allows itself to dawdle to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way,complex
realistic fiction typically involves a story whose basic setting time and location in the world is real and whose events could feasibly happen in a real-world setting non-realistic fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case often being set in an entirely imaginary universe an alternative history of the world other than that currently understood as true or some other non-existent location or time-period sometimes even presenting impossible technology or a defiance of the currently understood laws of nature,complex
however all types of fiction arguably invite their audience to explore real ideas issues or possibilities in an otherwise imaginary setting or using what is understood about reality to mentally construct something similar to reality though still distinct from it,complex
in terms of the traditional separation between fiction and non-fiction the lines are now commonly understood as blurred showing more overlap than mutual exclusion,complex
even fiction usually has elements of or grounding in truth,complex
the distinction between the two may be best defined from the perspective of the audience according to whom a work is regarded as non-fiction if its people places and events are all historically or factually real while a work is regarded as fiction if it deviates from reality in any of those areas,complex
the distinction between fiction and non-fiction is further obscured by an understanding on the one hand that the truth can be presented through imaginary channels and constructions while on the other hand imagination can just as well bring about significant conclusions about truth and reality,complex
literary critic james wood argues that fiction is both artifice and verisimilitude meaning that it requires both creative invention as well as some acceptable degree of believability a notion often encapsulated in poet samuel taylor coleridge 's term : willing suspension of disbelief,complex
the first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in temple rooms in sumer some dating back to bc,complex
these archives which mainly consisted of the records of commercial transactions or inventories mark the end of prehistory and the start of history,complex
things were much the same in the government and temple records on papyrus of ancient egypt,complex
the earliest discovered private archives were kept at ugarit besides correspondence and inventories texts of myths may have been standardized practice-texts for teaching new scribes,complex
there is also evidence of libraries at nippur about bc and those at nineveh about bc showing a library classification system,complex
over clay tablets from the library of ashurbanipal have been discovered at nineveh providing modern scholars with an amazing wealth of mesopotamian literary religious and administrative work,complex
among the findings were the enuma elish also known as the epic of creation which depicts a traditional babylonian view of creation the epic of gilgamesh a large selection of omen texts including enuma anu enlil which contained omens dealing with the moon its visibility eclipses and conjunction with planets and fixed stars the sun its corona spots and eclipses the weather namely lightning thunder and clouds and the planets and their visibility appearance and stations and astronomic/astrological texts as well as standard lists used by scribes and scholars such as word lists bilingual vocabularies lists of signs and synonyms and lists of medical diagnoses,complex
the tablets were stored in a variety of containers such as wooden boxes woven baskets of reeds or clay shelves,complex
the libraries were cataloged using colophons which are a publisher 's imprint on the spine of a book or in this case a tablet,complex
the colophons stated the series name the title of the tablet and any extra information the scribe needed to indicate,complex
eventually the clay tablets were organized by subject and size,complex
unfortunately due to limited to bookshelf space once more tablets were added to the library older ones were removed which is why some tablets are missing from the excavated cities in mesopotamia,complex
according to legend mythical philosopher laozi was keeper of books in the earliest library in china which belonged to the imperial zhou dynasty,complex
also evidence of catalogues found in some destroyed ancient libraries illustrates the presence of librarians,complex
the library of alexandria in egypt was the largest and most significant great library of the ancient world,complex
it flourished under the patronage of the ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the rd century bc until the roman conquest of egypt in bc,complex
the library was conceived and opened either during the reign of ptolemy i soter – bc or during the reign of his son ptolemy ii – bc,complex
an early organization system was in effect at alexandria,complex
the great library of alexandria would remain as the intellectual capital of the western world during the rise of christianity even after the library had suffered through fires and conquest,complex
this great library was more than a place to hold books and records it became a place of culture,complex
the alexandrian book collections steadily diminished as a result of natural causes war and wholesale theft by corrupt administrators,complex
the library of celsus in ephesus anatolia now part of selçuk turkey was built in honor of the roman senator tiberius julius celsus polemaeanus completed in by celsus ' son gaius julius aquila consul ad,complex
the library was built to store scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for celsus,complex
private or personal libraries made up of written books as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in archives appeared in classical greece in the th century bc,complex
the celebrated book collectors of hellenistic antiquity were listed in the late nd century in deipnosophistae,complex
all these libraries were greek,complex
the cultivated hellenized diners in deipnosophistae pass over the libraries of rome in silence,complex
by the time of augustus there were public libraries near the forums of rome,complex
there were libraries in the porticus octaviae near the theatre of marcellus in the temple of apollo palatinus and in the bibliotheca ulpiana in the forum of trajan,complex
the state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the roman forum and the capitoline hill,complex
private libraries appeared during the late republic : seneca inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime but displayed the scrolls in bookcases armaria of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling : by now like bathrooms and hot water a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house domus,complex
libraries were amenities suited to a villa such as cicero 's at tusculum maecenas 's several villas or pliny the younger 's all described in surviving letters,complex
at the villa of the papyri at herculaneum apparently the villa of caesar 's father-in-law the greek library has been partly preserved in volcanic ash archaeologists speculate that a latin library kept separate from the greek one may await discovery at the site,complex
in the west the first public libraries were established under the roman empire as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor,complex
rome 's first public library was established by asinius pollio,complex
pollio was a lieutenant of julius caesar and one of his most ardent supporters,complex
after his military victory in illyria pollio felt he had enough fame and fortune to create what julius caesar had sought for a long time : a public library to increase the prestige of rome and rival the one in alexandria,complex
pollios 's library the anla libertatis which was housed in the atrium libertatis was centrally located near the forum romanum,complex
it was the first to employ an architectural design that separated works into greek and latin,complex
all subsequent roman public libraries will have this design,complex
at the conclusion of rome 's civil wars following the death of marcus antonius in bc the emperor augustus sought to reconstruct many of rome 's damaged buildings,complex
during this construction augustus created two more public libraries,complex
the first was the library of the temple of apollo on the palatine often called the palatine library and the second was the library of the porticus of octaviae,complex
two more libraries were added by the emperor tiberius on palatine hill and one by vespasian after ad,complex
vespasian 's library was constructed in the forum of vespasian also known as the forum of peace and became one of rome 's principal libraries,complex
the bibliotheca pacis was built along the traditional model and had two large halls with rooms for greek and latin libraries containing the works of galen and lucius aelius,complex
one of the best preserved was the ancient ulpian library built by the emperor trajan,complex
completed in / the ulpian library was part of trajan 's forum built on the capitoline hill,complex
trajan 's column separated the greek and latin rooms which faced each other,complex
the structure was approximately fifty feet high with the peak of the roof reaching almost seventy feet,complex
unlike the greek libraries readers had direct access to the scrolls which were kept on shelves built into the walls of a large room,complex
reading or copying was normally done in the room itself,complex
the surviving records give only a few instances of lending features,complex
most of the large roman baths were also cultural centres built from the start with a library a two-room arrangement with one room for greek and one for latin texts,complex
libraries were filled with parchment scrolls as at library of pergamum and on papyrus scrolls as at alexandria : the export of prepared writing materials was a staple of commerce,complex
there were a few institutional or royal libraries which were open to an educated public such as the serapeum collection of the library of alexandria once the largest library in the ancient world but on the whole collections were private,complex
ludwig wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to address the definition of the word game,complex
in his philosophical investigations wittgenstein argued that the elements of games such as play rules and competition all fail to adequately define what games are,complex
from this wittgenstein concluded that people apply the term game to a range of disparate human activities that bear to one another only what one might call family resemblances,complex
as the following game definitions show this conclusion was not a final one and today many philosophers like thomas hurka think that wittgenstein was wrong and that bernard suits ' definition is a good answer to the problem,complex
french sociologist roger caillois in his book les jeux et les hommes games and men defined a game as an activity that must have the following characteristics : fun : the activity is chosen for its light-hearted character separate : it is circumscribed in time and place uncertain : the outcome of the activity is unforeseeable non-productive : participation does not accomplish anything useful governed by rules : the activity has rules that are different from everyday life fictitious : it is accompanied by the awareness of a different reality,complex
computer game designer chris crawford founder of the journal of computer game design has attempted to define the term game using a series of dichotomies : creative expression is art if made for its own beauty and entertainment if made for money,complex
a piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive,complex
movies and books are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment,complex
if no goals are associated with a plaything it is a toy,complex
crawford notes that by his definition a a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules and b the sims and simcity are toys not games,complex
if it has goals a plaything is a challenge,complex
if a challenge has no active agent against whom you compete it is a puzzle if there is one it is a conflict,complex
crawford admits that this is a subjective test,complex
video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in pac-man,complex
finally if the player can only outperform the opponent but not attack them to interfere with their performance the conflict is a competition,complex
competitions include racing and figure skating,complex
however if attacks are allowed then the conflict qualifies as a game,complex
crawford 's definition may thus be rendered as : an interactive goal-oriented activity made for money with active agents to play against in which players including active agents can interfere with each other,complex
a game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict defined by rules that results in a quantifiable outcome,complex
katie salen and eric zimmerman a game is a form of art in which participants termed players make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal,complex
greg costikyan according to this definition some games that do not involve choices such as chutes and ladders candy land and war are not technically games any more than a slot machine is,complex
a game is an activity among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context,complex
clark c,complex
abt at its most elementary level then we can define game as an exercise of voluntary control systems in which there is an opposition between forces confined by a procedure and rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome,complex
elliot avedon and brian sutton-smith a game is a form of play with goals and structure,complex
kevin j,complex
maroney to play a game is to engage in activity directed toward bringing about a specific state of affairs using only means permitted by specific rules where the means permitted by the rules are more limited in scope than they would be in the absence of the rules and where the sole reason for accepting such limitation is to make possible such activity,complex
bernard suits when you strip away the genre differences and the technological complexities all games share four defining traits : a goal rules a feedback system and voluntary participation,complex
jane mcgonigal,complex
games can be characterized by what the player does,complex
this is often referred to as gameplay,complex
major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of game,complex
games are often classified by the components required to play them e,complex
g,complex
miniatures a ball cards a board and pieces or a computer,complex
in places where the use of leather is well-established the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history resulting in a worldwide popularity of ball games such as rugby basketball soccer football cricket tennis and volleyball,complex
other tools are more idiosyncratic to a certain region,complex
many countries in europe for instance have unique standard decks of playing cards,complex
other games such as chess may be traced primarily through the development and evolution of its game pieces,complex
many game tools are tokens meant to represent other things,complex
a token may be a pawn on a board play money or an intangible item such as a point scored,complex
games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not use any obvious tool rather their interactivity is defined by the environment,complex
games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is altered,complex
for example hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game in a park an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course even with the same cars,complex
whereas games are often characterized by their tools they are often defined by their rules,complex
while rules are subject to variations and changes enough change in the rules usually results in a new game,complex
for instance baseball can be played with real baseballs or with wiffleballs,complex
however if the players decide to play with only three bases they are arguably playing a different game,complex
there are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own rules but even then there are often immutable meta-rules,complex
rules generally determine the time-keeping system the rights and responsibilities of the players and each player 's goals,complex
player rights may include when they may spend resources or move tokens,complex
common win conditions are being first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens as in settlers of catan having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the game as in monopoly or some relationship of one 's game tokens to those of one 's opponent as in chess 's checkmate,complex
a game 's tools and rules will result in its requiring skill strategy luck or a combination thereof and are classified accordingly,complex
games of skill include games of physical skill such as wrestling tug of war hopscotch target shooting and stake and games of mental skill such as checkers and chess,complex
games of strategy include checkers chess go arimaa and tic-tac-toe and often require special equipment to play them,complex
games of chance include gambling games blackjack mahjong roulette etc,complex
as well as snakes and ladders and rock paper scissors most require equipment such as cards or dice,complex
however most games contain two or all three of these elements,complex
for example american football and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy while tiddlywinks poker and monopoly combine strategy and chance,complex
many card and board games combine all three most trick-taking games involve mental skill strategy and an element of chance as do many strategic board games such as risk settlers of catan and carcassonne,complex
most games require multiple players,complex
however single-player games are unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces,complex
unlike a game with multiple players competing with or against each other to reach the game 's goal a one-player game is a battle solely against an element of the environment an artificial opponent against one 's own skills against time or against chance,complex
playing with a yo-yo or playing tennis against a wall is not generally recognized as playing a game due to the lack of any formidable opposition,complex
many games described as single-player may be termed actually puzzles or recreations,complex
a multiplayer game is a game of several players who may be independent opponents or teams,complex
games with many independent players are difficult to analyze formally using game theory as the players may form and switch coalitions,complex
the term game in this context may mean either a true game played for entertainment or a competitive activity describable in principle by mathematical game theory,complex
john nash proved that games with several players have a stable solution provided that coalitions between players are disallowed,complex
nash won the nobel prize for economics for this important result which extended von neumann 's theory of zero-sum games,complex
nash 's stable solution is known as the nash equilibrium,complex
if cooperation between players is allowed then the game becomes more complex many concepts have been developed to analyze such games,complex
while these have had some partial success in the fields of economics politics and conflict no good general theory has yet been developed,complex
in quantum game theory it has been found that the introduction of quantum information into multiplayer games allows a new type of equilibrium strategy not found in traditional games,complex
the entanglement of players 's choices can have the effect of a contract by preventing players from profiting from what is known as betrayal,complex
games can take a variety of forms from competitive sports to board games and video games,complex
many sports require special equipment and dedicated playing fields leading to the involvement of a community much larger than the group of players,complex
early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats,complex
the earliest example is from —a cathode ray tube amusement device was filed for a patent on january by thomas t,complex
goldsmith jr,complex
and estle ray mann and issued on december as u,complex
patent,complex
inspired by radar display technology it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets which were drawings fixed to the screen,complex
other early examples include : the nimrod computer at the festival of britain oxo a tic-tac-toe computer game by alexander s,complex
douglas for the edsac in tennis for two an electronic interactive game engineered by william higinbotham in spacewar written by mit students martin graetz steve russell and wayne wiitanen 's on a dec pdp- computer in and the hit ping pong-style pong a game by atari,complex
each game used different means of display : nimrod used a panel of lights to play the game of nim oxo used a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe tennis for two used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court and spacewar used the dec pdp- 's vector display to have two spaceships battle each other,complex
in computer space created by nolan bushnell and ted dabney was the first commercially sold coin-operated video game,complex
it used a black-and-white television for its display and the computer system was made of series ttl chips,complex
the game was featured in the science fiction film soylent green,complex
computer space was followed in by the magnavox odyssey the first home console,complex
modeled after a late s prototype console developed by ralph h,complex
baer called the brown box it also used a standard television,complex
these were followed by two versions of atari 's pong an arcade version in and a home version in that dramatically increased video game popularity,complex
the commercial success of pong led numerous other companies to develop pong clones and their own systems spawning the video game industry,complex
a flood of pong clones eventually led to the video game crash of which came to an end with the mainstream success of taito 's shooter game space invaders marking the beginning of the golden age of arcade video games and inspiring dozens of manufacturers to enter the market,complex
the game inspired arcade machines to become prevalent in mainstream locations such as shopping malls traditional storefronts restaurants and convenience stores,complex
the game also became the subject of numerous articles and stories on television and in newspapers and magazines establishing video gaming as a rapidly growing mainstream hobby,complex
space invaders was soon licensed for the atari vcs later known as atari becoming the first killer app and quadrupling the console 's sales,complex
this helped atari recover from their earlier losses and in turn the atari vcs revived the home video game market during the second generation of consoles up until the north american video game crash of,complex
the home video game industry was revitalized shortly afterwards by the widespread success of the nintendo entertainment system which marked a shift in the dominance of the video game industry from the united states to japan during the third generation of consoles,complex
,complex
the term platform refers to the specific combination of electronic components or computer hardware which in conjunction with software allows a video game to operate,complex
the term system is also commonly used,complex
the distinctions below are not always clear and there may be games that bridge one or more platforms,complex
in addition to laptop/desktop computers and mobile devices there are other devices which have the ability to play games but are not primarily video game machines such as pdas and graphing calculators,complex
in common use a pc game refers to a form of media that involves a player interacting with a personal computer connected to a video monitor,complex
personal computers are not dedicated game platforms so there may be differences running the same game in different hardware also the openness allows some features to developers like reduced software cost increased flexibility increased innovation emulation creation of modifications mods open hosting for online gaming in which a person plays a video game with people who are in a different household and others,complex
a console game is played on a specialized electronic device home video game console that connects to a common television set or composite video monitor unlike pcs which can run all sorts of computer programs a console is a dedicated video game platform manufactured by a specific company,complex
usually consoles only run games developed for it or games from other platform made by the same company but never games developed by its direct competitor even if the same game is available on different platforms,complex
it often comes with a specific game controller,complex
major console platforms include xbox playstation and nintendo,complex
a handheld gaming device is a small self-contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user 's hands,complex
it features the console a small screen speakers and buttons joystick or other game controllers in a single unit,complex
by the late th century the cambridge region already had a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due to monks from the nearby bishopric church of ely,complex
however it was an incident at oxford which is most likely to have formed the establishment of the university : two oxford scholars were hanged by the town authorities for the death of a woman without consulting the ecclesiastical authorities who would normally take precedence and pardon the scholars in such a case but were at that time in conflict with king john,complex
the university of oxford went into suspension in protest and most scholars moved to cities such as paris reading and cambridge,complex
after the university of oxford reformed several years later enough scholars remained in cambridge to form the nucleus of the new university,complex
in order to claim precedence it is common for cambridge to trace its founding to the charter from king henry iii granting it the right to discipline its own members ius non-trahi extra and an exemption from some taxes oxford would not receive a similar enhancement until,complex
a bull in from pope gregory ix gave graduates from cambridge the right to teach everywhere in christendom,complex
after cambridge was described as a studium generale in a letter by pope nicholas iv in and confirmed as such in a bull by pope john xxii in it became common for researchers from other european medieval universities to visit cambridge to study or to give lecture courses,complex
the colleges at the university of cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the system,complex
no college is as old as the university itself,complex
the colleges were endowed fellowships of scholars,complex
there were also institutions without endowments called hostels,complex
the hostels were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries but they have left some indications of their existence such as the name of garret hostel lane,complex
hugh balsham bishop of ely founded peterhouse cambridge 's first college in,complex
many colleges were founded during the th and th centuries but colleges continued to be established until modern times although there was a gap of years between the founding of sidney sussex in and that of downing in,complex
the most recently established college is robinson built in the late s,complex
however homerton college only achieved full university college status in march making it the newest full college it was previously an approved society affiliated with the university,complex
in medieval times many colleges were founded so that their members would pray for the souls of the founders and were often associated with chapels or abbeys,complex
a change in the colleges ' focus occurred in with the dissolution of the monasteries,complex
king henry viii ordered the university to disband its faculty of canon law and to stop teaching scholastic philosophy,complex
in response colleges changed their curricula away from canon law and towards the classics the bible and mathematics,complex
nearly a century later the university was at the centre of a protestant schism,complex
many nobles intellectuals and even commoners saw the ways of the church of england as being too similar to the catholic church and felt that it was used by the crown to usurp the rightful powers of the counties,complex
east anglia was the centre of what became the puritan movement,complex
at cambridge it was particularly strong at emmanuel st catharine 's hall sidney sussex and christ 's college,complex
they produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced by social position or pulpit the approximately puritans who left for new england and especially the massachusetts bay colony during the great migration decade of the s,complex
oliver cromwell parliamentary commander during the english civil war and head of the english commonwealth – attended sidney sussex,complex
examination in mathematics was once compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the bachelor of arts degree the main first degree at cambridge in both arts and sciences,complex
from the time of isaac newton in the later th century until the mid-th century the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics particularly mathematical physics,complex
the exam is known as a tripos,complex
students awarded first-class honours after completing the mathematics tripos are termed wranglers and the top student among them is the senior wrangler,complex
the cambridge mathematical tripos is competitive and has helped produce some of the most famous names in british science including james clerk maxwell lord kelvin and lord rayleigh,complex

after the cambridge university act formalised the organizational structure of the university the study of many new subjects was introduced such as theology history and modern languages,complex
resources necessary for new courses in the arts architecture and archaeology were donated by viscount fitzwilliam of trinity college who also founded the fitzwilliam museum,complex
between and downing college sold part of its land to build the downing site comprising new scientific laboratories for anatomy genetics and earth sciences,complex
during the same period the new museums site was erected including the cavendish laboratory which has since moved to the west cambridge site and other departments for chemistry and medicine,complex
the university of cambridge began to award phd degrees in the first third of the th century,complex
the first cambridge phd in mathematics was awarded in,complex
in the first world war members of the university served and were killed,complex
teaching and the fees it earned came almost to a stop and severe financial difficulties followed,complex
as a consequence the university first received systematic state support in and a royal commission appointed in recommended that the university but not the colleges should receive an annual grant,complex
following the second world war the university saw a rapid expansion of student numbers and available places this was partly due to the success and popularity gained by many cambridge scientists,complex
the university was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the parliament of england and was later one of eight represented in the parliament of the united kingdom,complex
the constituency was created by a royal charter of and returned two members of parliament until when it was abolished by the representation of the people act,complex
the constituency was not a geographical area,complex
its electorate consisted of the graduates of the university,complex
before the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or ma degree,complex
for many years only male students were enrolled into the university,complex
the first colleges for women were girton college founded by emily davies in and newnham college in founded by anne clough and henry sidgwick followed by hughes hall in founded by elizabeth phillips hughes as the cambridge teaching college for women murray edwards college founded by rosemary murray as new hall in and lucy cavendish college in,complex
the first women students were examined in but attempts to make women full members of the university did not succeed until,complex
women were allowed to study courses sit examinations and have their results recorded from for a brief period after the turn of the twentieth century this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive ad eundem degrees from the university of dublin,complex
from women were awarded diplomas which conferred the title of the degree of bachelor of arts,complex
as they were not admitted to the degree of bachelor of arts they were excluded from the governing of the university,complex
since students must belong to a college and since established colleges remained closed to women women found admissions restricted to colleges established only for women,complex
darwin college the first wholly graduate college of the university matriculated both men and women students from its inception in – and elected a mixed fellowship,complex
of the undergraduate colleges starting with churchill clare and king 's colleges the former men 's colleges began to admit women between and,complex
one of the female-only colleges girton also began to admit male students from but the other female-only colleges did not do likewise,complex
as a result of st hilda 's college oxford ending its ban on male students in cambridge is now the only remaining united kingdom university with female-only colleges newnham murray edwards and lucy cavendish,complex
in the academic year – the university 's student sex ratio including post-graduates was male : female,complex
as an institution with such a long history the university has developed a large number of myths and legends,complex
the vast majority of these are untrue but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides,complex
a discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon the 'prize ' awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the mathematical tripos,complex
the last of these spoons was awarded in to cuthbert lempriere holthouse an oarsman of the lady margaret boat club of st john 's college,complex
it was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle,complex
it can now be seen outside the senior combination room of st john 's,complex
since examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit,complex
this made it harder to ascertain who was entitled to the spoon unless there was only one person in the third class and so the practice was abandoned,complex
each christmas eve bbc radio and television broadcasts the festival of nine lessons and carols sung by the choir of king 's college cambridge,complex
the radio broadcast has been a national christmas tradition since it was first transmitted in though the festival has existed since,complex
the radio broadcast is carried worldwide by the bbc world service and is also syndicated to hundreds of radio stations in the us,complex
the first television broadcast of the festival was in,complex

the university occupies a central location within the city of cambridge with the students taking up a significant proportion nearly of the town 's population and heavily affecting the age structure,complex
most of the older colleges are situated nearby the city centre and river cam along which it is traditional to punt to appreciate the buildings and surroundings,complex
examples of notable buildings include king 's college chapel the history faculty building designed by james stirling and the cripps building at st john 's college,complex
the brickwork of several of the colleges is also notable : queens ' college contains some of the earliest patterned brickwork in the country and the brick walls of st john 's college provide examples of english bond flemish bond and running bond,complex
the university is divided into several sites where the different departments are placed,complex
the main ones are : the university 's school of clinical medicine is based in addenbrooke 's hospital where students in medicine undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their ba degree while the west cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host a new sports development,complex
in addition the judge business school situated on trumpington street provides management education courses since and is consistently ranked within the top business schools globally by the financial times,complex
given that the sites are in relative close proximity to each other and the area around cambridge is reasonably flat one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle : a fifth of the journeys in the city are made by bike a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances,complex
the relationship between the university and the city has not always been positive,complex
the phrase town and gown is employed to differentiate inhabitants of cambridge from students at the university who historically wore academical dress,complex
there are many stories of ferocious rivalry between the two categories : in strong clashes brought about attacks and looting of university properties while locals contested the privileges granted by the government to the academic staff,complex
following these events the chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute the criminals and re-establish order in the city,complex
attempts to reconcile the two groups followed over time and in the th century agreements were signed to improve the quality of streets and student accommodation around the city,complex
however this was followed by new confrontations when the plague hit cambridge in and colleges refused to help those affected by the disease by locking their sites,complex
nowadays these conflicts have somewhat subsided and the university has become an opportunity for employment among the population providing an increased level of wealth in the area,complex
the enormous growth in the number of high-tech biotech providers of services and related firms situated near cambridge has been termed the cambridge phenomenon : the addition of new registered companies and as many as jobs between and has been directly related to the presence and importance of the university,complex
cambridge is a collegiate university meaning that it is made up of self-governing and independent colleges each with its own property and income,complex
most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines and within each faculty school or department within the university academics from many different colleges will be found,complex
the faculties are responsible for ensuring that lectures are given arranging seminars performing research and determining the syllabi for teaching overseen by the general board,complex
together with the central administration headed by the vice-chancellor they make up the entire cambridge university,complex
facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels : by the university the cambridge university library by the faculties faculty libraries such as the squire law library and by the individual colleges all of which maintain a multi-discipline library generally aimed mainly at their undergraduates,complex
the colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property founded as integral parts of the university,complex
all students and most academics are attached to a college,complex
their importance lies in the housing welfare social functions and undergraduate teaching they provide,complex
all faculties departments research centres and laboratories belong to the university which arranges lectures and awards degrees but undergraduates receive their supervisions—small-group teaching sessions often with just one student—within the colleges though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in the areas concerned,complex
each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows who are also members of a university department,complex
the colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university in accordance with university regulations,complex
cambridge has colleges of which three murray edwards newnham and lucy cavendish admit women only,complex
the other colleges are mixed though most were originally all-male,complex
darwin was the first college to admit both men and women while churchill clare and king 's were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates in,complex
magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women in,complex
clare hall and darwin admit only postgraduates and hughes hall lucy cavendish st edmund 's and wolfson admit only mature i,complex
e,complex
years or older on date of matriculation students encompassing both undergraduate and graduate students,complex
all other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students with no age restrictions,complex
colleges are not required to admit students in all subjects with some colleges choosing not to offer subjects such as architecture history of art or theology but most offer close to the complete range,complex
some colleges maintain a bias towards certain subjects for example with churchill leaning towards the sciences and engineering while others such as st catharine 's aim for a balanced intake,complex
others maintain much more informal reputations such as for the students of king 's to hold left-wing political views or robinson 's and churchill 's attempts to minimise their environmental impact,complex
costs to students accommodation and food prices vary considerably from college to college,complex
similarly college expenditure on student education also varies widely between individual colleges,complex
there are also several theological colleges in cambridge separate from cambridge university including westcott house westminster college and ridley hall theological college that are to a lesser degree affiliated to the university and are members of the cambridge theological federation,complex
the colleges are :,complex
in addition to the colleges the university is made up of over departments faculties schools syndicates and other institutions,complex
members of these are usually also members of one of the colleges and responsibility for running the entire academic programme of the university is divided amongst them,complex
the university also houses the institute of continuing education a centre for part-time study,complex
a school in the university of cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units,complex
each has an elected supervisory body—the council of the school—comprising representatives of the constituent bodies,complex

the office of chancellor of the university for which there are no term limits is mainly ceremonial and is held by david sainsbury baron sainsbury of turville following the retirement of the duke of edinburgh on his th birthday in june,complex
lord sainsbury was nominated by the official nomination board to succeed him and abdul arain owner of a local grocery store brian blessed and michael mansfield were also nominated,complex
the election took place on and october,complex
david sainsbury won the election taking of the votes cast winning on the first count,complex
the current vice-chancellor is stephen toope,complex
while the chancellor 's office is ceremonial the vice-chancellor is the de facto principal administrative officer of the university,complex
the university 's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by its own members with very little external representation on its governing body the regent house though there is external representation on the audit committee and there are four external members on the university 's council who are the only external members of the regent house,complex
the senate consists of all holders of the ma degree or higher degrees,complex
it elects the chancellor and the high steward and elected two members of the house of commons until the cambridge university constituency was abolished in,complex
prior to it was the university 's governing body fulfilling the functions that the regent house fulfils today,complex
the regent house is the university 's governing body a direct democracy comprising all resident senior members of the university and the colleges together with the chancellor the high steward the deputy high steward and the commissary,complex
the public representatives of the regent house are the two proctors elected to serve for one year on the nomination of the colleges,complex
although the university council is the principal executive and policy-making body of the university it must report and be accountable to the regent house through a variety of checks and balances,complex
it has the right of reporting to the university and is obliged to advise the regent house on matters of general concern to the university,complex
it does both of these by causing notices to be published by authority in the cambridge university reporter the official journal of the university,complex
since january the membership of the council has included two external members and the regent house voted for an increase from two to four in the number of external members in march and this was approved by her majesty the queen in july,complex
the general board of the faculties is responsible for the academic and educational policy of the university and is accountable to the council for its management of these affairs,complex
faculty boards are responsible to the general board other boards and syndicates are responsible either to the general board if primarily for academic purposes or to the council,complex
in this way the various arms of the university are kept under the supervision of the central administration and thus the regent house,complex
in – it was reported that approximately one third of cambridge 's income comes from uk government funding for teaching and research with another third coming from other research grants,complex
endowment income contributes around £ million,complex
the university also receives a significant income in annual transfers from the cambridge university press,complex
in bill gates of microsoft donated us million through the bill and melinda gates foundation to endow the gates scholarships for students from outside the uk seeking postgraduate study at cambridge,complex
in the year ended july the university had a total income of £,complex
billion of which £ million was from research grants and contracts,complex
the university of cambridge borrowed million pounds by issuing a -year security bond in october,complex
its interest rate is about,complex
percent higher than a british government -year bond,complex
vice chancellor leszek borysiewicz hailed the success of the issue,complex
in a report the russell group of leading universities made a conclusion that higher education could be financed by issuing bonds,complex
cambridge is a member of the russell group of research-led british universities the g the league of european research universities and the international alliance of research universities and forms part of the golden triangle of highly research intensive and elite southern english universities,complex
it is also closely linked with the development of the high-tech business cluster known as silicon fen and as part of the cambridge university health partners an academic health science centre,complex

undergraduate applications to cambridge must be made through ucas in time for the early deadline currently mid-october in the year before starting,complex
until the s candidates for all subjects were required to sit special entrance examinations since replaced by additional tests for some subjects such as the thinking skills assessment and the cambridge law test,complex
the university is considering reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects with effect from,complex
the university gives offers of admission to,complex
of its applicants the nd lowest amongst the russell group,complex
the acceptance rate for students in the – cycle was,complex
most applicants who are called for interview will have been predicted at least three a-grade a-level qualifications relevant to their chosen undergraduate course or the equivalent in other qualifications such as getting at least for higher-level subjects at ib,complex
the a a-level grade introduced in now plays a part in the acceptance of applications with the university 's standard offer for most courses being set at aaa with aaa for sciences courses,complex
due to a very high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades the interview process is crucial for distinguishing between the most able candidates,complex
the interview is performed by college fellows who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors such as potential for original thinking and creativity,complex
for exceptional candidates a matriculation offer is sometimes offered requiring only two a-levels at grade e or above,complex
in students who were rejected went on to get a levels or more at grade a representing about of all applicants rejected,complex
strong applicants who are not successful at their chosen college may be placed in the winter pool where they can be offered places by other colleges,complex
this is in order to maintain consistency throughout the colleges some of which receive more applicants than others,complex
graduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department relating to the applicant 's subject,complex
when an offer is made this effectively guarantees admission to a college—though not necessarily the applicant 's preferred choice,complex
public debate in the united kingdom continues over whether admissions processes at oxford and cambridge are entirely merit based and fair whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply to cambridge and whether these students succeed in gaining entry,complex
in – of all successful applicants were from state schools roughly percent of all students in the uk attend state schools,complex
critics have argued that the lack of state school applicants with the required grades applying to cambridge and oxford has had a negative impact on oxbridge 's reputation for many years and the university has encouraged pupils from state schools to apply for cambridge to help redress the imbalance,complex
others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering,complex
the proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years and such applicants now form a very large minority of the intake,complex
in of the applicants from independent schools were admitted to cambridge as opposed to of the applications from state schools,complex
in the university of cambridge received a gift of £m to improve its accessibility to candidates from maintained schools,complex
cambridge together with oxford and durham is among those universities that have adopted formulae that gives a rating to the gcse performance of every school in the country to weight the scores of university applicants,complex
with the release of admissions figures a article in the guardian reported that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants,complex
the university was hence criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants,complex
the university denied the claims of institutional discrimination by stating the figures did not take into account other variables,complex
a following article stated that in the years – ethnic minority applicants to medicine with a grades or higher were less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades,complex
the university refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects claiming it would be too costly,complex
there are a number of educational consultancies that offer support with the applications process,complex
some make claims of improved chances of admission but these claims are not independently verified,complex
none of these companies are affiliated to or endorsed by the university of cambridge,complex
the university informs applicants that all important information regarding the application process is public knowledge and none of these services is providing any inside information,complex
cambridge university has been criticised because many colleges admit a low proportion of black students though many apply,complex
of the colleges at cambridge admitted fewer than black or mixed race students from to,complex
the academic year is divided into three academic terms determined by the statutes of the university,complex
michaelmas term lasts from october to december lent term from january to march and easter term from april to june,complex
within these terms undergraduate teaching takes place within eight-week periods called full terms,complex
according to the university statutes it is a requirement that during this period all students should live within miles of the church of st mary the great this is defined as keeping term,complex
students can graduate only if they fulfill this condition for nine terms three years when obtaining a bachelor of arts or twelve terms four years when studying for a master of science engineering or mathematics,complex
these terms are shorter than those of many other british universities,complex
undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the christmas easter and long vacations,complex
triposes involve a mixture of lectures organised by the university departments and supervisions organised by the colleges,complex
science subjects also involve laboratory sessions organised by the departments,complex
the relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject,complex
supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students usually between one and three meet with a member of the teaching staff or with a doctoral student,complex
students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of the supervision which they will discuss with the supervisor during the session along with any concerns or difficulties they have had with the material presented in that week 's lectures,complex
the assignment is often an essay on a subject set by the supervisor or a problem sheet set by the lecturer,complex
depending on the subject and college students might receive between one and four supervisions per week,complex
this pedagogical system is often cited as being unique to oxford where supervisions are known as tutorials and cambridge,complex
a tutor named william farish developed the concept of grading students ' work quantitatively at the university of cambridge in,complex
the university of cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in most academic disciplines,complex
all research and lectures are conducted by university departments,complex

at the university of cambridge each graduation is a separate act of the university 's governing body the regent house and must be voted on as with any other act,complex
a formal meeting of the regent house known as a congregation is held for this purpose,complex
this is the common last act at which all the different university procedures for : undergraduate and graduate students and the different degrees land,complex
after degrees are approved to have them conferred candidates must ask to their colleges to be presented during a congregation,complex
this happened until the when for the first time a graduate student dr luca epis refused the degree approved by the board of graduate studies creating a leading case on the matter,complex
graduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating : for example most students becoming bachelors of arts wear undergraduate gowns and not ba gowns,complex
graduates receiving a postgraduate degree e,complex
g,complex
phd or master 's wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating only if their first degree was also from the university of cambridge if their first degree is from another university they wear the academic dress of the degree that they are about to receive the ba gown without the strings if they are under years of age or the ma gown without strings if they are and over,complex
graduates are presented in the senate house college by college in order of foundation or recognition by the university except for the royal colleges,complex
during the congregation graduands are brought forth by the praelector of their college who takes them by the right hand and presents them to the vice-chancellor for the degree they are about to take,complex
the praelector presents graduands with the following latin statement the following forms were used when the vice-chancellor was female substituting ____ with the name of the degree : dignissima domina domina procancellaria et tota academia praesento vobis hunc virum quem scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneum ad gradum assequendum _____ idque tibi fide mea praesto totique academiae,complex
most worthy vice-chancellor and the whole university i present to you this man whom i know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of ____ for which i pledge my faith to you and to the whole university,complex
and female graduands with the following : dignissima domina domina procancellaria et tota academia praesento vobis hanc mulierem quam scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneam ad gradum assequendum ____ idque tibi fide mea praesto totique academiae,complex
most worthy vice-chancellor and the whole university i present to you this woman whom i know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of ____ for which i pledge my faith to you and to the whole university,complex
after presentation the graduand is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following latin statement—the trinitarian formula in nomine patris,complex
may be omitted at the request of the graduand : auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum ____ in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti,complex
by the authority committed to me i admit you to the degree of ____ in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit,complex
the now-graduate then rises bows and leaves the senate house through the doctor 's door where he or she receives his or her certificate into senate house passage,complex

the united states is a federal republic,simple
the federal government of the united states is set up by the constitution,simple
there are three branches,simple
they are the executive branch the legislative branch and the judicial branch,simple
state governments and the federal government work in very similar ways,simple
each state has its own executive legislative and judicial branches,simple
the executive branch of a state government is led by a governor instead of a president,simple
the executive branch is the part of the government that enforces the law,simple
members of the u,simple
s,simple
electoral college elect a president who is the leader of the executive branch as well as the leader of the armed forces,simple
the president may veto a bill that the congress has passed so it does not become a law,simple
the president may also make executive orders to ensure that people follow the law,simple
the president is in charge of many departments that control much of the day-to-day actions of government,simple
for example department of commerce makes rules about trade,simple
the president chooses the heads of these departments and also nominates federal judges,simple
however the senate part of the legislative branch must agree with all of the people the president chooses,simple
the president may serve two -year terms,simple
the legislative branch makes laws,simple
the legislative branch is called the united states congress,simple
congress is divided into two houses,simple
one house is the house of representatives,simple
the representatives are each elected by voters from a set area within a state,simple
the number of representatives a state has is based on how many people live there,simple
representatives serve two-year terms,simple
the total number of representatives today is,simple
the leader of the house of representatives is the speaker of the house,simple
the other house is the senate,simple
in the senate each state is represented equally by two senators,simple
because there are states there are senators,simple
the president 's treaties or appointments of officials need the senate 's approval,simple
senators serve six-year terms,simple
the vice president of the united states serves as president of the senate,simple
in practice the vice president is usually absent from the senate and a senator serves as president pro tempore or temporary president of the senate,simple
representatives and senators propose laws called bills in their respective houses,simple
a bill may be voted upon by the entire house right away or may first go to a small group known as a committee which may recommend a bill for a vote by the whole house,simple
if one house votes to pass a bill the bill then gets sent to the other house if both houses vote for it it is then sent to the president who may sign the bill into law or veto it,simple
if the president vetoes the bill it is sent back to congress,simple
if congress votes again and passes the bill with at least a two-thirds majority the bill becomes law and can not be vetoed by the president,simple
under the american system of federalism congress may not make laws that directly control the states instead congress may use the promise of federal funds or special circumstances such as national emergencies to encourage the states to follow federal law,simple
this system is both complex and unique,simple
the judicial branch is the part of government that interprets what the law means,simple
the judicial branch is made up of the supreme court and many lower courts,simple
if the supreme court decides that a law is not allowed by the constitution the law is said to be struck down and is no longer a valid law,simple
the supreme court is made up of nine judges called justices who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the senate,simple
one of these justices called the chief justice heads the court,simple
a supreme court justice serves until he or she dies or resigns quits in the middle of his or her term,simple
when that happens the president nominates someone new to replace the justice who left,simple
if the senate agrees with that choice the person becomes a justice,simple
if the senate does not agree with the president 's choice then the president must nominate someone else,simple
famous court cases such as marbury v madison which was decided in have firmly established that the supreme court is the ultimate interpreter of the united states constitution and has the power to strike down any law that conflicts with it,simple
the united states of america consists of states territories and district washington d,simple
c,simple
states can make laws about things inside the state but federal law is about things dealing with more than one state or dealing with other countries,simple
in some areas if the federal government makes laws that say different things from the state laws people must follow the federal law because the state law is not a law any more,simple
each state has a constitution of its own different from the federal national constitution,simple
each of these is like the federal constitution because they say how each state 's government is set up but some also talk about specific laws,simple
the federal and most state governments are dominated by two political parties : the republicans and the democrats,simple
there are many smaller parties the largest of these are the libertarian party and the green party,simple
people help in political campaigns that they like,simple
they try to persuade politicians to help them this is called lobbying,simple
all americans are allowed to do these things but some have and spend more money than others or in other ways do more in politics,simple
some people think this is a problem and lobby for rules to be made to change it,simple
since the president is a republican and congress is also republican-controlled so the republicans have more power in the federal government,simple
there are still many powerful democrats who can try to stop the republicans from doing things that they believe will be bad for the country,simple
also members of a party in power do not always agree on what to do,simple
if enough people decide to vote against republicans in the next election they will lose power,simple
in a republic like the united states no party can do whatever they want,simple
all politicians have to argue compromise and make deals with each other to get things done,simple
they have to answer to the people and take responsibility for their mistakes,simple
the usa 's large cultural economic and military influence has made the foreign policy of the united states or relations with other countries a topic in american politics and the politics of many other countries,simple

one of the differences between using bitcoin and using regular money online is that bitcoin can be used without having an internet connection to link any sort of real-world identity to it,simple
unless someone chooses to link their name to a bitcoin address it is hard to tell who owns the address,simple
bitcoin does not keep track of users it keeps track of addresses where the money is,simple
each address has two important pieces of cryptographic information or keys : a public one and a private one,simple
the public key which is what the bitcoin address is created from is similar to an email address anyone can look it up and send bitcoins to it,simple
the private address or private key is similar to an email password only with it can the owner send bitcoins from it,simple
because of this it is very important that this private key is kept secret,simple
to send bitcoins from an address you prove to the network that you own the private key that corresponds to the address without revealing the private key,simple
this is done with a branch of mathematics known as public key cryptography,simple
a public key is what determines the ownership of bitcoins and is very similar to an id number,simple
if someone wanted to send you bitcoins all you would need to do is supply them your bitcoin address which is a version of your public key that is easier to read and type,simple
for example if bob has bitcoin at the bitcoin address abc and alice has no bitcoins at the bitcoin address def bob can send,simple
bitcoins to def,simple
as soon as the transaction is processed alice and bob both have,simple
bitcoins,simple
anyone using the system can see how much money abc has and how much money def has but they can not tell anything about who owns the address,simple
in the example above abc and def are the bitcoin addresses of bob and alice,simple
but bob and alice each have a second key which only they individually know,simple
this is the private key and it is the other half of a bitcoin address,simple
the private key is never shared and allows the owner of the bitcoins to control them,simple
however if the private key is not kept secret then anyone who sees it can also control and take the bitcoins there,simple
this happened on live tv when bloomberg 's matt miller accidentally showed a private key to viewers,simple
the money was taken immediately,simple
the person who took it told others about it later saying i 'll send it back once matt gives me a new address since someone else can sweep [ empty ] out the old one,simple
,simple
sites or users using the bitcoin system are required to use a global database called the blockchain,simple
the blockchain is a record of all transactions that have taken place in the bitcoin network,simple
it also keeps track of new bitcoins as they are generated,simple
with these two facts the blockchain can keep track of who has how much money at all times,simple
to generate a bitcoin a miner must solve a math problem,simple
however the difficulty of the math problem depends on how many people are mining for bitcoin at the moment,simple
because of how complicated the math problems usually are they must be calculated with very powerful processors,simple
these processors can be found in cpus graphics cards or specialized machines called asics,simple
the process of generating the bitcoins is called mining,simple
people who use these machines to mine bitcoins are called miners,simple
miners either compete with one another or work together in groups to solve a mathematical puzzle,simple
the first miner or group of miners to solve the particular puzzle are rewarded with new bitcoins,simple
the puzzle is determined by the transactions being sent at the time and the previous puzzle solution,simple
this means the solution to one puzzle is always different from the puzzles before,simple
attempting to change an earlier transaction maybe to fake bitcoins being sent or change the number of someone 's bitcoins requires solving that puzzle again which takes a lot of work and also requires solving each of the following puzzles which takes even more work,simple
this means a bitcoin cheater needs to outpace all the other bitcoin miners to change the bitcoin history,simple
this makes the bitcoin blockchain very safe to use,simple
a popular image associated with bitcoin is a qr code,simple
qr codes are a group of black and white boxes that are similar to barcodes,simple
barcodes are a row of lines and qr codes are a grid of squares,simple
bitcoin uses qr codes because they can store more information in a small space and a camera such as a smartphone can read them,simple
the two qr codes on the bitcoin note are the public and private addresses and can be scanned with a number of online tools,simple
everyone in the bitcoin network is considered a peer and all addresses are created equal,simple
all transactions can take place solely from peer to peer but a number of sites exist to make these transactions simpler,simple
these sites are called exchanges,simple
exchanges provide tools for dealing in bitcoin,simple
some allow the purchase of bitcoin from external accounts and others allow trading with other cryptography-based currencies like bitcoin,simple
most exchanges also provide a basic wallet service,simple
wallets provide a handy way to keep track of all of a user 's public and private addresses,simple
because addresses are pseudo-anonymous anyone can have as many addresses as they want,simple
this is useful for dealing with multiple people but it can get complicated to manage multiple accounts,simple
a wallet holds all of this information in a convenient place just like a real wallet would,simple
a backup of a wallet prevents 'losing ' the bitcoins,simple
bitcoin adoption and use continues to grow a lot every year,simple
since bitcoin has gained the attention of the mainstream media one way is the wannacry ransomware created in may,simple
adoption growth has not only happened for consumers but also for many companies who are looking to make use of all of the advantages of bitcoin,simple
among millennials cryptocurrencies were a popular choice to invest in in a recent survey of americans,simple
specifically the survey found that,simple
of millennials - would invest the in cryptocurrencies compared to,simple
of generation xers - and,simple
of baby boomers,simple

specifically of the millennials in the survey said that they would invest the in bitcoin in ethereum and in litecoin,simple
although the real time price and trading in bitcoin varies with market demand,simple
bitcoin has often been criticized for its unstable price its network 's high electricity consumption and for its high transaction fees,simple
additionally it has been criticized for having characteristics in common with ponzi and pyramid schemes,simple

facebook has been involved in many controversies over privacy,simple
some of these controversies have been about people being able to see personal information that other people post and others are about companies and advertisers being able to see users ' personal information,simple

scientists found that the more time people spent on facebook over a two-week period the worse they subsequently felt,simple
on the surface facebook provides an invaluable resource for fulfilling the basic human need for social connection,simple

obama 's presidential campaign for the white house started in early june when he defeated hillary clinton in the democratic primaries,simple
hillary clinton was favored to win but obama won many smaller state caucuses local party elections by having a lot of volunteers,simple
he decided not to accept government money for his campaign so that he could accept more private money under campaign finance reform in the united states,simple
he raised the most amount of money ever for a presidential campaign,simple
obama 's campaign theme was that he was a man of hope and change,simple
he was also against the war in iraq,simple

obama also had trouble when his minister at church jeremiah wright was videotaped criticizing america,simple
during the campaign obama said that his opponent republican candidate john mccain was just like george w,simple
bush something that john mccain said was not true,simple
he defeated mccain in the election on november by a wide electoral majority of to meaning that he won the most votes in enough states to send people to officially elect him,simple
the popular vote based on the total number of votes across the country was closer with obama winning mccain,simple

he called the plan the stimulus bill,simple
the stimulus bill funded many road projects gave money to schools gave tax credits to many americans and funded many science and research projects,simple
he continued the financial bailout that george w,simple

he also decided that the usa should help in the war against libya,simple
he has said several times that he wants to improve u,simple
relations with the muslim world,simple
obama received the nobel peace prize on october,simple
he noted that his efforts were humble but he donated the prize money to several charities,simple
though his popularity was very high around approval when he entered office his approval ratings fell to percent during the year of,simple
he received much criticism from republicans conservatives libertarians and members of the tea party because they believe that the federal government is becoming too big and spending too much money and that his programs are not the best for the country,simple
with rising economic deficits the amount of money the government borrows each month under his administration he called for taxes to be increased on the rich,simple
he criticized his republican opponents for wanting to cut welfare benefits for the poor rather than raising taxes to help pay down the debt,simple

on april obama declared that he would stand for re-election for a second term in in a video titled it begins with us that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the federal election commission,simple
he was officially nominated for his party 's presidential choice on september,simple
mitt romney was officially nominated as his opponent by the republican party on august,simple
while the election results were very close obama easily won the electoral college votes he needed to win a second term,simple
obama and romney spent more than billion on advertising during the election campaign,simple
the start of his second term in had a few setbacks,simple
with the nsa people were upset at the obama administration that the government was possibly listening to their phone calls,simple
his party the democrats also lost the congressional elections,simple
because of disagreements between democrats and republicans in congress neither side is getting anything done and obama has resulted in using his executive order his power as president to help reform things like the immigration system,simple
he 's also supported increasing the minimum wage requiring women to be paid the same as men at the same job and has called for the first years of college to be fully government-funded for students who study full-time and get good grades,simple
after the death of supreme court justice antonin scalia obama nominated merrick garland to replace him on march but the nomination expired because the senate refused to hold a vote for him,simple
youtube needed the adobe flash player plug-in to play videos in the past,simple
however in january youtube tried using the built-in features of web browsers so people would not need to use adobe flash player to watch videos,simple
all youtube users can upload -minute long videos,simple
users who have used the site for enough time and follow the rules can upload videos that are hours long,simple
a user needs to verify the account to do this however,simple
everyone could upload long videos when youtube started but in march a ten-minute video limit was put in,simple
the limit was changed to minutes in july,simple
most video formats can be uploaded to youtube and videos can also be uploaded from mobile phones,simple
youtube is blocked in many schools because it allows children to search for videos online that could distract them from their lessons much like how other social networking sites and game sites are blocked for the same purpose,simple
but at a higher level than schools and in workplaces even some governments have blocked youtube access to their country 's public but their reasons can vary,simple
on december the government of iran blocked youtube and several other sites to stop films and music from other countries from being seen,simple
turkey blocked youtube on march for letting videos that were mean or discriminating to turks and atatürk who is the founder of modern turkey to be shown because of a virtual war between greeks armenians kurds and turks on youtube with people from each side posting videos to hurt the other,simple
the video that caused the banning said that turks and atatürk were 'gay ',simple
the video was first mentioned on turkish cnn and the istanbul public prosecutor sued youtube for being mean to turkishness,simple
the court suspended access to youtube while waiting for the removal of the video,simple
the ban was criticized a lot,simple
youtube lawyers sent proof of removal to court and users could access the website again on march,simple
during the week of march youtube was blocked in thailand,simple
many bloggers people who have a diary online believed the reason youtube was blocked was because of a video of the former prime minister thaksin shinawatra 's speech on cnn,simple
however the government did not confirm or give reasons for the ban,simple
youtube was unblocked on march,simple
on the night of april youtube was again blocked in thailand,simple
the government said it was because of a video on the site that it said was insulting to king bhumibol adulyadej,simple
the ministry of information and communication technology claimed that it would unblock youtube in a few days after websites with references to this video are blocked instead of the entire website,simple
communications minister sitthichai pookaiyaudom said when they decide to withdraw the clip we will withdraw the ban,simple
soon after this incident the internet technology blog mashable was banned from thailand over the reporting of the youtube clips in question,simple
youtube is being sued by brazilian model and mtv vj daniela cicarelli better known as ronaldo 's ex-fiancée because she says that the site is making available a video footage made by a paparazzi or celebrity photographer in which she and her boyfriend are having sex on a spanish beach,simple
the lawsuit says that youtube has to be blocked in brazil until all copies of the video are removed,simple
on saturday january a legal injunction command ordered that filters be put in place to prevent users in brazil from going to the website,simple
the effectiveness of the measure has been questioned since the video is not available only on youtube but rather has become an internet phenomenon,simple
on tuesday january the same court overturned their earlier decision ordering the filters to be taken down even though the footage was still forbidden but without technical support for its blockage,simple
on may the state-owned company maroc telecom blocked all access to youtube,simple
there were no reasons given why youtube was blocked,simple
but the guesses are that it might have something to do with some pro-separatist group polisario clips polisario is the western sahara independence movement or because of some videos that criticized king mohammed vi,simple
this block did not concern the other two private internet-providers wana and meditel,simple
youtube became accessible again on may after maroc telecom unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was only a technical glitch,simple
in australia some schools including all secondary schools in victoria have youtube blocked from student access after fights have been posted on youtube,simple
currently in china the government has blocked youtube,simple
for several years it has been unblocked but since the past five years it has been blocked,simple
according the site 's terms of service users may upload videos only if they have the permission of the copyright holder and of the people in the video,simple
pornography defamation harassment commercials and videos that encourage criminal conduct may not be uploaded,simple
the uploader gives youtube permission to give out and change the uploaded video for any purpose and they do not have permission anymore when the uploader deletes the video from the site,simple
users may view videos on the site but are not allowed to save them on their computers,simple
on june google ceo eric schmidt was in paris to launch the new localization system,simple
the interface of the website is available with localized versions in countries and a worldwide version,simple
the interface of the youtube website is available in language versions including albanian amharic armenian bengali burmese khmer kyrgyz laotian mongolian persian and uzbek which do have local channel versions,simple
aristotle 's father nicomachus was a solider of king amyntas of macedonia,simple
from his eighteenth to his thirty-seventh year aristotle lived in athens as a metic and student of plato,simple
at about the age of eighteen he went to athens to continue his education at plato 's academy,simple
aristotle remained at the academy for nearly twenty years not leaving until after plato 's death in bc,simple
he then traveled with xenocrates to asia minor,simple
while in asia aristotle traveled with theophrastus to the island of lesbos where they researched the botany and zoology of the island,simple
soon after hermias ' death aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander the great in b,simple
c,simple
aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon,simple
during that time he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings : ptolemy and cassander,simple
aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards persia was ethnocentric,simple
in one famous example he advises alexander to be 'a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants',simple
pby bc he had returned to athens starting his own school there known as the lyceum,simple
aristotle taught courses at the school for the next twelve years,simple
it is during this period in athens from to when aristotle is believed to have written many of his works,simple
aristotle wrote many dialogues only fragments of which survived,simple
the works that have survived are in fairly rough form,simple
they are generally thought to be lecture notes for his students,simple
aristotle 's combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of greek knowledge,simple
it has been suggested that aristotle was probably the last person to know everything there was to be known in his own time,simple
near the end of alexander 's life he began to suspect plots and threatened aristotle in letters,simple
aristotle was vocal about his dislike for alexander 's claim of divinity and the king executed aristotle 's grandnephew callisthenes as a traitor,simple
alexander died in babylon in without ever having returned to his native land,simple
upon alexander 's death anti-macedonian sentiment in athens once again flared up and aristotle fled the city,simple
however he died in euboea of natural causes that same year bc,simple
the three greatest ancient greek philosophers were aristotle plato and socrates,simple
socrates taught plato then plato taught aristotle,simple
these three thinkers turned early greek philosophy into the beginnings of western philosophy as it is today,simple
aristotle taught alexander the great who later conquered the entire middle east,simple
plato 's main ideas were that knowledge from the senses was always confused and not pure,simple
true knowledge can be gotten from the thinking soul that turns away from the world,simple
only the soul can have knowledge of forms the real way things are,simple
the world is only a copy of these forms and is not perfect,simple
aristotle thought differently,simple
he thought that knowledge from the senses was more important,simple
these thoughts became some of the roots of the scientific method after hundreds of years,simple
most of the things aristotle wrote that we still have today are notes from his speaking and teaching,simple
some of his important writings are physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics de anima on the soul and poetics,simple
he also had problems with the atomic theory,simple
he did not believe in democritus ' theories about the atomic theory,simple
he believed that all matter was continuous whereas democritus stated the all matter was made up of tiny indivisible things called atoms,simple
democritus was proved right by physicist john dalton in,simple
aristotle created a form of logic,simple
his logic is called sentential logic because it uses sentences for the syllogism,simple
aristotle 's logic influenced the history of western thought,simple
it was aristotle 's logic which was copied and used in the arabic and latin mediaeval traditions,simple
it was dominant for two and a half thousand years until the late th century,simple
then modern logic was started by gottlob frege charles sanders peirce and others,simple
aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail,simple
he certainly did research on the natural history of lesbos and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas,simple
the works history of animals generation of animals and parts of animals have observations and interpretations along with some myths and mistakes,simple
the most striking passages are about the sea-life round lesbos,simple
as well as live observation he got specimens from the catches of fishermen,simple
his observations on catfish electric fish torpedo and angler-fish are detailed,simple
his writing on cephalopods such as octopus sepia cuttlefish and the paper nautilus argonauta argo are accurate,simple
his description of the hectocotyl arm used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the th century,simple
he separated the aquatic mammals from fish and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called selachē selachimorpha,simple
another good example of his methods comes from the generation of animals in which aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated,simple
he gave accurate descriptions of ruminants ' four-chambered fore-stomachs and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark mustelus mustelus,simple
the works are traditionally listed in this sequence : logiccategories terms on interpretation propositions truth prior analytics syllogistic logic posterior analytics scientific method topics rules for argument and debate on sophistical refutations fallaciesscience and naturephysics change motion void time on the heavens structure of heaven earth elements on generation and corruption meteorology origin of comets weather disastersthe parva naturalia psychological workssense and sensibilia faculties senses mind imagination on memory sleep dreams and prophesy length of lifeworks on natural historyhistory of animals on the parts of animals on the movement of animals on the progression of animals on the generation of animals problemsphilosophical worksmetaphysics substance cause form potentiality nicomachean ethics soul happiness virtue friendship eudemian ethics virtues vices politics best states utopias rhetoric debate poetics tragedy epic poetrythe constitution of the athenians fragments,simple
aristotle is still one of the most influential people who ever lived,simple
he contributed to almost every kind of knowledge in his day and he started many new fields,simple
it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did,simple
aristotle was the founder of formal logicp pioneered the study of zoology and helped to develop scientific method,simple
pdespite these achievements aristotle 's errors are thought by some such as peter medawar to have held back science considerably,simple
bertrand russell notes that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine,simple
russell also refers to aristotle 's ethics as repulsive and calls his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy,simple
russell says these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembers what an advance he made on his predecessors,simple
the immediate influence of aristotle 's work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school of philosophers,simple
aristotle 's influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter 's bringing with him on his expedition biologists and researchers,simple
list of biologists,simple
the first known statistics are census data,simple
the babylonians did a census around bc the egyptians around bc and the ancient chinese around bc,simple
before we can describe the world with statistics we must collect data,simple
the data that we collect in statistics are called measurements,simple
after we collect data we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement,simple
for example suppose we want to find out how popular a certain tv show is,simple
we can pick a group of people called a sample out of the total population of viewers,simple
then we ask each viewer in the sample how often they watch the show,simple
the sample is data that you can see and the population is data that you can not see since you did not ask every viewer in the population,simple
for another example if we want to know whether a certain drug can help lower blood pressure we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after,simple
numbers that describe data that you can see are called descriptive statistics,simple
numbers that make predictions about data that you ca n't see are called inferential statistics,simple
descriptive statistics involves using numbers to describe features of data,simple
for example the average height of women in the united states is a descriptive statistic that describes a feature average height of a population women in the united states,simple
once the results have been summarized and described they can be used for prediction,simple
this is called inferential statistics,simple
as an example the size of an animal is dependent on many factors,simple
some of these factors are controlled by the environment but others are by inheritance,simple
a biologist might therefore make a model that says that there is a high probability that the offspring will be small in size if the parents were small in size,simple
this model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random,simple
testing whether a certain drug can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those of people who are given a placebo,simple
most often we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments,simple
for example an opinion poll is one kind of survey,simple
we pick a small number of people and ask them questions,simple
then we use their answers as the data,simple
the choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important as it directly influences the statistics,simple
when the statistics are done it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken,simple
suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake,simple
if we take samples next to the waste drain we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far away hard to reach spot of the lake,simple
there are two kinds of problems which are commonly found when taking samples : if there are many samples the samples will likely be very close to what they are in the real population,simple
if there are very few samples however they might be very different from what they are in the real population,simple
this error is called a chance error see errors and residuals in statistics,simple
the individuals for the samples need to be chosen carefully usually they will be chosen randomly,simple
if this is not the case the samples might be very different from what they really are in the total population,simple
this is true even if a great number of samples is taken,simple
this kind of error is called bias,simple
we can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly,simple
however sometimes large random samples are hard to take,simple
and bias can happen if different people are not asked or refuse to answer our questions or if they know they are getting a fake treatment,simple
these problems can be hard to fix,simple
see also standard error,simple
,simple
the middle of the data is called an average,simple
the average tells us about a typical individual in the population,simple
there are three kinds of average that are often used : the mean the median and the mode,simple
the examples below use this sample data : name a b c d e f g h i j -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - score,simple
the formula for the mean is x ¯ = n ∑ i = n x i = x x ⋯ x n n \displaystyle \bar x=\frac n\sum _i=nx_i=\frac x_x_\cdots x_nn where x x … x n \displaystyle x_x_\ldots x_n are the data and n \displaystyle n is the population size,simple
see sigma notation,simple
this means that you add up all the values and then divide by the number of values,simple
in our example x ¯ = / =,simple
\displaystyle \bar x=/=,simple
the problem with the mean is that it does not tell anything about how the values are distributed,simple
values that are very large or very small change the mean a lot,simple
in statistics these extreme values might be errors of measurement but sometimes the population really does contain these values,simple
for example if in a room there are people who make /day and who makes /day,simple
the mean of the data is /day,simple
even though it is the average amount the mean in this case is not the amount any single person makes thus is useless for some purposes,simple
this is the arithmetic mean,simple
other kinds are useful for some purposes,simple
the median is the middle item of the data,simple
to find the median we sort the data from the smallest number to the largest number and then choose the number in the middle,simple
if there is an even number of data there will not be a number right in the middle so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean,simple
in our example there are items of data the two middle ones are and so the median is / =,simple
another example like the income example presented for the mean consider a room with people who have incomes of and the median is because is the average of the two middle numbers and,simple
if the extreme value of is ignored the mean is,simple
in this case the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out,simple
the median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the definition of mean above,simple
the mode is the most frequent item of data,simple
for example the most common letter in english is the letter e,simple
we would say that e is the mode of the distribution of the letters,simple
for example if in a room there are people with incomes of and the mode is because occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times,simple
there can be more than one mode,simple
for example if in a room there are people with incomes of and the modes are and,simple
this is bi-modal or has two modes,simple
bi-modality is very common and often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups,simple
for instance the average height of all adults in the u,simple
has a bi-modal distribution,simple
this is because males and females have separate average heights of,simple
m ft ⁄ in for men and,simple
m ft in for women,simple
these peaks are apparent when both groups are combined,simple
the mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order,simple
another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is,simple
a common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the standard deviation,simple
if the standard deviation of a set of data is small then most of the data is very close to the average,simple
if the standard deviation is large though then a lot of the data is very different from the average,simple
if the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution then it is very useful to know the standard deviation,simple
if the data follows this pattern we would say the data is normally distributed about of every pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation,simple
not only that but about of every measurements will be off the average by less that two times the standard deviation and about in will be closer to the average than three standard deviations,simple
we also can use statistics to find out that some percent percentile number or fraction of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain category,simple
for example social scientists used statistics to find out that of people in the world are males,simple
== references ==,simple
before people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold but no one managed to do that,simple
this was called alchemy,simple
alchemists separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it,simple
they also processed special minerals from a mine in sweden to get rare earth metals,simple
radioactivity was also discovered,simple
today chemists have discovered different elements,simple
some are very common like oxygen,simple
many are very rare and expensive like platinum,simple
some can not be found on earth and can only be made in labs like rutherfordium,simple
since the s the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists ' theories about chemical reactions,simple
with smaller and faster computers chemists have built better tools for analyzing substances,simple
these tools have been sent to study chemicals on mars,simple
police also use those tools to study evidence from crime scenes,simple
there are several types of chemistry,simple
analytical chemistry looks at which chemicals are in things,simple
for example looking at how much arsenic is in food,simple
organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them,simple
for example making acetylene,simple
inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them,simple
one example is making an integrated circuit,simple
a large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry,simple
this looks at plastics,simple
one example is making nylon,simple
because plastics are made of carbon polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry,simple
another area is biochemistry,simple
this looks at the chemistry of living things,simple
an example would be seeing how arsenic poisons people,simple
biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry,simple
there are many other small branches of chemistry,simple
,simple
the basic unit of an element is called an atom,simple
an atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down turning into a lighter element for example through nuclear fission or radioactive decay,simple
a chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements,simple
in a compound two or more atoms are joined together to form a molecule,simple
the tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules,simple
mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted,simple
an example would be mixing sand and salt,simple
this can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately,simple
chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction,simple
an example would be heating sodium bicarbonate common baking soda,simple
it will make water carbon dioxide and sodium carbonate,simple
this reaction can not be undone,simple
one very important concept in chemistry is that different atoms interact with one another in very specific proportions,simple
for example two hydrogen atoms interacting with one oxygen atom lead to the water molecule ho,simple
this relationship is known as the law of constant proportions and leads to the idea of stoichiometry a term that refers to the ratios of different atoms in chemical compounds,simple
for example in water there are always exactly hydrogen atoms to oxygen atom,simple
in carbon dioxide there are exactly oxygen atoms for carbon atom,simple
these relationships are described using chemical formulas such as ho two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom and co one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms,simple
because atoms of different elements react with one another in very specific proportions but atoms of different elements have different weights chemists often describe the amount of different elements and compounds in terms of the number of moles,simple
a mole of any element contains the same number of atoms : atoms,simple
the atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole,simple
for example the atomic mass of copper is about,simple
that means about,simple
grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms,simple
the atomic mass of chlorine is about,simple
that means,simple
grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it,simple
moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds too,simple
copperii chloride is an example,simple
cucl is its chemical formula,simple
there is one copper atom,simple
and two chlorine atoms,simple
· =,simple
add all the molar masses of the elements together to get the molar mass of the chemical compound,simple
,simple
=,simple
that means in,simple
grams of copperii chloride there is one mole of copperii chloride molecules,simple
this concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants chemicals that are reacted should be left,simple
if too much reactant is used there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction,simple
acids and bases are common chemicals,simple
acids release h ions when in water and bases release oh− ions when in water,simple
acids can react with bases,simple
the h ion is taken from the acid by the base,simple
this makes water ho,simple
a salt is also made when an acid and a base react together,simple
an example would be reacting hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh,simple
hydrochloric acid releases h and cl- ions in water,simple
the base releases na and oh- ions,simple
the h and the oh- react to make water,simple
there is a solution of sodium chloride nacl left,simple
sodium chloride is a salt,simple
chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science,simple
most objects are made by chemists people who do chemistry,simple
chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances,simple
chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we use every day,simple
many chemicals are harmless but there are some chemicals that are dangerous,simple
for example mercuryii chloride is very toxic,simple
chromates can cause cancer,simple
tinii chloride pollutes water easily,simple
hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns,simple
some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire,simple
to stay safe chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab,simple
they use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained,simple
the chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly,simple

most historians agree that the game of chess was first played in northern india during the gupta empire in the th century ad,simple
this early type of chess was known as chaturanga a sanskrit word for the military,simple
the gupta chess pieces were divided like their military into the infantry cavalry elephants and chariots,simple
in time these pieces became the pawn knight bishop and rook,simple
the english words chess and check both come from the persian word shāh meaning king,simple
the earliest written evidence of chess is found in three romances epic stories written in sassanid persia around ad,simple
the game was known as chatrang or shatranj,simple
when persia was taken over by muslims – the game was spread to all parts of the muslim world,simple
muslim traders carried the game to russia and to western europe,simple
by the year it had spread all over europe,simple
in the th century a spanish manuscript called libro de los juegos describes the games of shatranj chess backgammon and dice,simple
the game changed greatly between about to,simple
the rules of the older game were changed in the west so that some of the pieces queen bishop had more scope development of the pieces was faster and the game more exciting,simple
the new game formed the basis of modern international chess,simple
historians of chess consider this as the most important change since the game was invented,simple
the rules of chess are governed by the world chess federation which is known by the initials fide meaning fédération internationale des échecs,simple
the rules are in the section laws of chess of the fide handbook,simple
fide also give rules and guidelines for chess tournaments,simple
chess is played on a square board divided into eight rows of squares called ranks and eight columns called files with a dark square in each player 's lower left corner,simple
this is altogether squares,simple
the colors of the squares are laid out in a checker chequer pattern in light and dark squares,simple
to make speaking and writing about chess easy each square has a name,simple
each rank has a number from to and each file a letter from a to h,simple
this means that every square on the board has its own label such as g or f,simple
the pieces are in white and black sets,simple
the players are called white and black and at the start of a game each player has pieces,simple
the pieces are one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns,simple
in this game out can get up to a quadruple pon king knight queen and also the king although it is very rare,simple
definitions : vertical lines are files horizontal lines are ranks lines at ° are diagonals,simple
each piece has its own way of moving around the board,simple
the x marks the squares where the piece can move,simple
the knight is the only piece that can jump over another piece,simple
no piece may move to a square occupied by a piece of the same color,simple
all pieces capture the same way they move except pawns,simple
the king 's move is one square in any direction,simple
the king k for short may not move to any square where it is threatened by an opposing piece,simple
however the king can move to a square that is occupied by an opponent 's piece and capture the piece taking it off the board,simple
the queen q can move any distance in any direction on the ranks files and diagonals,simple
the rooks r move any distance on the ranks or files,simple
the bishops b move diagonally on the board,simple
since a bishop can only move diagonally it will always be on the same color square,simple
the knights kt or n move in an l shape,simple
each move must be either two squares along a rank and one square along a file or two squares along a file and one square along a rank,simple
it is the only piece that can jump over other pieces,simple
like the other pieces it captures an opposing piece by landing on its square,simple
the pawns can only move up the board,simple
on its first move a pawn may move either one or two squares forward,simple
a pawn captures one square diagonally not as it moves : see white circles on its diagram,simple
besides in some situations pawns can capture opponent 's pawns in a special way called en passant which means in passing in french see below,simple
most pieces capture as they move,simple
if a piece lands on an opponent 's piece the opposing piece is taken off the board,simple
there are three special cases : the king can not be taken see check and checkmate,simple
no piece can be taken while castling see below,simple
pawns take one square diagonally,simple
if a move is made which attacks the opposing king that king is said to be 'in check ',simple
the player whose king is checked must make a move to remove the check,simple
the options are : moving the king capturing the threatening piece or moving another piece between the threatening piece and the king,simple
if the player whose king is in danger can not do any of these things it is checkmate and the player loses the game,simple
,simple
once in every game each king can make a special move known as castling,simple
when the king castles it moves two squares to the left or right,simple
when this happens the rook is moved to stand on the opposite side of the king,simple
castling is only allowed if all of these rules are kept : p neither piece doing the castling may have been moved during the game,simple
there must be no pieces between the king and the rook,simple
the king may not be currently in check nor may the king pass through any square attacked by the opponent,simple
as with any move castling is not allowed if it would place the king in check,simple
en passant 'in passing ' in french is a special capture,simple
it is only available when a pawn moves forward two squares past an opposing pawn on an adjacent file,simple
the opposing pawn must be on the th rank from its own side,simple
then the opponent 's pawn can capture the double-mover as if it had only moved one square forward,simple
this option is open on the next move only,simple
for example if the black pawn has just moved up two squares from g to g then the white pawn on f can take it by en passant on g,simple
the en passant rule was developed when pawns were allowed to make their double move,simple
the rule made it more difficult for players to avoid pawn exchanges and blockade the position,simple
it kept the game more open,simple
when a pawn moves to its eighth rank it must be changed for a piece : a queen rook bishop or knight of the same color player 's choice,simple
normally the pawn is queened but in some advantageous cases another piece is chosen called 'under-promotion',simple
checkmates are rare in competitive chess,simple
the most common ends are decisions made by one or both players,simple
checkmate,simple
when a king is in check and can not get out of it,simple
resignation,simple
a player may resign at any time usually because his/her position is hopeless,simple
a losing player is able to resign by placing their king on its side on the chessboard,simple
out of time,simple
if player 's clock time is over exceeding the time control,simple
strictly speaking this is not part of the rules of the game but part of the rules of tournament and match chess where chess clocks are used,simple
chapter,simple
draw agreed,simple
a game may end in a draw at any time if one player offers a draw and the other accepts,simple
dead position,simple
a position where no series of legal moves could lead to a mate example : kb vs k,simple
the game is drawn,simple
p stalemate,simple
if a player can not make a move and the player 's king is not in check this is also a draw,simple
this kind of draw is called a stalemate and is rare,simple
-move rule,simple
a game will also end in a draw if no piece is captured and no pawn has moved after fifty moves,simple
this is called the fifty-move rule and happens late in the game,simple
threefold repetition,simple
if the exactly same position is repeated three times during a game with the same player to move each time the player next to move may claim a draw,simple
the game is now drawn,simple
this is called a draw by threefold repetition,simple
the fide rules for competitive chess include all the above rules plus several others,simple
p et seq,simple
if players wish to adjust a piece on the board they must first say j'adoube i adjust or the equivalent,simple
apart from that if a piece is touched it must be moved if possible,simple
this is the 'touch and move ' law,simple
p if no legal move is possible with the touched piece the player must make a legal move with another piece,simple
section p et seq when a player 's hand leaves a piece after moving it then the move is over and may not be changed if the move was legal,simple
there are a few famous cases where players appeared to break this rule without being punished,simple
the most famous example was by the then world champion garry kasparov against judit polgar in a top-class tournament,simple
competitive games of chess must be played with special chess clocks which time a player only when it is his/her turn to move,simple
the essence is that a player has to make a certain number of moves in a certain total time,simple
after moving the player presses a button on the clock,simple
this stops the player 's clock and start 's the opponent 's clock,simple
usually the clocks are mechanical but some are electronic,simple
article p et seq electronic clocks can be set to various programs and they can count moves made,simple
chapter,simple
the moves of a chess game are written down by using a special chess notation,simple
this is compulsory for any competitive game,simple
article appendix e usually algebraic chess notation is used,simple
in algebraic notation each square has one and only one name whether you are looking from white 's side of the board or black 's,simple
here moves are written in the format of : initial of piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved,simple
for example qg means queen moves to the g-file and th rank that is to the square g,simple
if there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square one more letter or number is added to show the file or rank from which the piece moved e,simple
g,simple
ngf means knight from the g-file moves to the square f,simple
the letter p showing a pawn is not used so that e means pawn moves to the square e,simple
if the piece makes a capture x is written before the square in which the capturing piece lands on,simple
example : bxf means bishop captures on f,simple
when a pawn makes a capture the file from which the pawn left is used in place of a piece initial,simple
for example : exd means pawn captures on d,simple
if a pawn moves to its eighth rank getting a promotion the piece chosen is written after the move for example eq or e=q,simple
castling is written by the special notations - for kingside castling and -- for queenside,simple
a move which places the opponent 's king in check normally has the notation added,simple
checkmate can be written as or,simple
at the end of the game - means white won - means black won and ½-½ is a draw,simple
in print figurines like those in diagrams but smaller are used for the pieces rather than initials,simple
this has the advantage of being language-free whereas the initials of pieces are different in every language,simple
typefaces which include figurines can be purchased by chess authors,simple
also basic notes can be added by using a system of well-known punctuation marks and other symbols,simple
for example : means a good move means a very good move ? means a bad move ? ? a very bad move sometimes called a blunder ? a creative move that may be good and ? a doubtful move,simple
the purpose of these methods is to make publications readable in a wider range of countries,simple
for example one kind of a simple trap known as the scholar 's mate as in the diagram to the right may be recorded :,simple
e e,simple
qh ? nc,simple
bc nf ? ?,simple
qe would prevent the mate with,simple
nf next move,simple
qxf - with figurines in place of the initials this would be understood by players everywhere,simple
players may not smoke in the playing area but only in areas designated by the organiser,simple
mobile phones may not be used or even switched on,simple
players may not use any sources of advice and may not analyse on any device,simple
these and other matters are covered by the fide laws on the conduct of the players,simple

chess is an easy game to learn the moves but a difficult game to master,simple
strategy is an important part of the game,simple
first of all comes the openings about which a great deal is now known,simple
the best-known move the king 's pawn opening is the white player moving his king 's pawn on e forward two spaces to e,simple
black can reply to that move in various ways,simple
the first moves of a chess game are called the opening,simple
a chess opening is a name given to a series of opening moves,simple
recognized patterns of opening moves are openings and have been given names such as the ruy lopez or sicilian defence,simple
they are listed in reference works such as the encyclopaedia of chess openings,simple
there are dozens of different openings,simple
they range from gambits where a pawn say is offered for fast development e,simple
g,simple
the king 's gambit to slower openings which lead to a manoeuvring type of game e,simple
g,simple
the réti opening,simple
in some opening lines the sequence thought best for both sides has been worked out to – moves but most players avoid such lines,simple
expert players study openings throughout their chess career as opening theory keeps on developing,simple
the basic aims of the opening phase are : development : to place develop the pieces mostly bishops and knights on useful squares where they will have the most powerful impact on the game,simple
control of the center : the center is the most important part of the board,simple
the player who controls the center can move his/her pieces around freely,simple
his/her opponent on the other hand will find his/her pieces cramped and difficult to move about,simple
king safety : keeping the king safe from danger,simple
castling see section above can often do this,simple
pawn structure : pawns can be used to control the center,simple
players try to avoid making pawn weaknesses such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and pawn islands – and to force such weaknesses in the opponent 's position,simple
players think and chess databases prove that white by virtue of the first move begins the game with a better chance,simple
black normally tries to equalise or to get some counterplay,simple
the middlegame is the part of the game after most pieces have been developed,simple
it is where most games are won and lost,simple
many games will end in resignation even before an endgame takes place,simple
a middlegame position has a structure,simple
that structure is determined by the opening,simple
the simplest way to learn the middlegame is to select an opening and learn it well see examples in english opening and french defence,simple
these are some things to look for when looking at a middlegame position : material : changes in the balance of material are critical,simple
to lose a piece for nothing is enough to lose a game,simple
if the players are evenly matched then a rough material balance of pieces is normal,simple
material balance is often quite static : it does not change for many moves,simple
development : the opening may have left one player with a lead in development,simple
that player has the initiative and may attack before the opponent can get his pieces out,simple
it is a temporary asset : if a lead in development is not used effectively it will disappear,simple
the centre : in the centre pieces have their greatest effect and some such as the knight attack more squares in the centre than at the sides,simple
the player who controls the centre will almost always have the advantage,simple
mobility : a position is mobile if the pieces can get where they need to,simple
almost all middle game positions have some limitations to mobility,simple
look for open files for the rooks and open diagonals for the bishops,simple
outposts are what knights need places where they can not easily be dislodged,simple
king safety : where is the king ? ideally a king should be castled and kept behind a screen of pawns,simple
many other things may happen in practice,simple
if a king is weak it may be put under direct attack,simple
pawns : they provide the skeleton of a position,simple
they move slowly and may become blocked for many moves,simple
everything takes place round the pawns,simple
different openings produce different pawn structures,simple
in this way openings influence the whole game philidor : pawns are the soul of chess,simple
here is an example from the borderline between opening and middlegame,simple
in the diagram to the left white will operate mainly on the q-side and black on the k-side,simple
white to play may wish to cope with black playing,simple
nf,simple
he can do this by playing,simple
g or by playing,simple
re so that if,simple
nf,simple
bf will preserve the bishop in this position an important defensive piece,simple
or maybe white will plough ahead with,simple
c the key move on the q-side,simple
chessbase shows that the number of tournament games with these choices were :,simple
re,simple
g,simple
c the data base also shows that the overall results were significantly better for,simple
re,simple
what the player does is note the features on the board and formulate a plan which takes the features into account,simple
then the player works out a sequence of moves,simple
of course in practice the opponent is interfering with the plan at every step,simple
the endgame or end game or ending is the part of the game when there are few pieces left on the board,simple
there are three main strategic differences between earlier parts of the game and endgame : pawns : during the endgame pawns become more special,simple
in the endgame one thing players try to do is to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank,simple
kings : may become strong pieces in the endgame,simple
the king may be brought towards the center of the board,simple
there it can support its own pawns attack the opponent 's pawns and oppose the opponent 's king,simple
draws : in the endgame a game may be drawn because there are too few pieces on the board to allow a player to win,simple
this is one of the main reasons for games to be drawn,simple
all endgame positions can be put into two camps,simple
on the one hand are positions which may be won by force,simple
on the other hand are positions which are drawn or which should be drawn,simple
the ones that are drawn for certain may be legally drawn mate could not happen or drawn by chess experience no sane defence could lose,simple
all endgames in master chess revolve around the borderline between winning and drawing,simple
generally once a 'textbook ' drawn position is reached the players will agree a draw otherwise they play on,simple
endgames can be studied according to the types of pieces that remain on board,simple
for example king and pawn endgames have only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns,simple
other endings are studied according to the pieces on board other than kings e,simple
g,simple
rook and pawn versus rook endgame,simple
basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces enough to checkmate the opponent 's king,simple
they are usually learned at the beginner stage,simple
examples are mate with kq v k kr v k kb v k kbn v k this one is quite difficult,simple
there are two types of chess programs,simple
one is to play against you the other is to help you become a better player by learning more,simple
the two types can be made to work together though they have different functions,simple
chess engines are computer systems that can play chess games against human opponents,simple
quite a number have been devised they can play at master level though their processes are quite different from a human being,simple

fritz is a german chess program by frans morsch and mathias feist published by chessbase,simple
it is the current market leader,simple
there is also a different kind of fritz called deep fritz that is made for multi-processing,simple
the latest kinds of the consumer products are deep fritz and fritz,simple
they came with reviews by josh waitzkin who said that fritz is like a woman that you ca n't get with,simple
it just drives makes you to think in ways you 've never thought before,simple

rybka a product by vasik rajlich is shredder 's main rival,simple
chess databases do not actually play,simple
they give access to the recorded history of master chess,simple
there are two components,simple
first there is the software which lets one search and organise the database material,simple
then there is the actual database typically one to four million games,simple
in practice databases are used for two purposes,simple
first for a player to train his/her ability at specific openings,simple
second to look up specific opponents to see what they play and prepare against them beforehand,simple
the existence of chess databases is one of the reasons young players can achieve mastery at an early age,simple
chessbase is the biggest database and widely used by masters,simple
although it can be used online most users download the software and data onto their computer,simple
if that computer happens to be a laptop then they might take the laptop to tournaments to help prepare for games,simple
players may not use computers or any other aid during games but much preparation goes on behind the scenes,simple
chessbase has to be purchased and it is not cheap,simple
this is a dutch magazine for advanced players which runs an on-line database called nicbase as part of its services,simple
nicbase is free and has over a million games,simple
chessgames,simple
com runs an on-line database of games,simple
it is partly free but requires registration,simple
full access to all its facilities is by a fairly modest subscription,simple
it has over half a million games on its database,simple
there are websites which a player can join for a fee and play on line,simple
in this case the subscriber will play against other subscribers not a computer,simple
all standards of players are amongst the members and various events are on offer at different rates of play,simple

python is used by hundreds of thousands of programmers and is used in many places,simple
sometimes only python code is used for a program but most of the time it is used to do simple jobs while another programming language is used to do more complicated tasks,simple
its standard library is made up of many functions that come with python when it is installed,simple
on the internet there are many other libraries available that make it possible for the python language to do more things,simple
these libraries make it a powerful language it can do many different things,simple
some things that python is often used for are : web development game programming desktop guis scientific programming network programming,simple
this is a small example of a python program,simple
it shows hello world on the screen,simple
python also does something called dynamic variable assignment,simple
this means that when a number or word is made in a program the user does not have to say what type it is,simple
this makes it easier to reuse variable names making fast changes simpler,simple
an example of this is shown below,simple
this code will make both a number and a word and show them both using only one variable,simple
in a statically typed language like c a programmer would have to say whether x was a number or a word before c would let the programmer set up x and after that c would not allow its type to change from a number to a word,simple
the ancient greeks had comedies which were presented in competitions at the festival of dionysia,simple
one of the best-known comedy authors of the time was aristophanes about – bc,simple
one of his works the clouds was performed bc,simple
the work did not survive completely but a later version did survive,simple
it is a satire against socrates and pictures the great philosopher as a swaggering con artist,simple
some of the accusations were re-used at socrates ' trial twenty years later,simple
typical for satire are that the author criticizes society and living people,simple
another type of ancient greek theatre was the satyr play,simple
this was mock drunkenness brazen sexuality including phallic props pranks sight gags and general merriment,simple
the modern equivalent would be knock-about comedy,simple
humour or 'new comedy ' is not about criticizing people or ideas but rather about showing characters in funny situations,simple
the most important greek playwright of this type was probably menander,simple
the best known roman comedy writer was plautus,simple
he often used greek comedies for his plays,simple
many comedy plays were written in the s by the british writer william shakespeare,simple
shakespeare 's comedy plays include : all ’ s well that ends well the comedy of errors a midsummer nights dream and twelfth night,simple
in shakespeare 's day a comedy did not mean a play that would make people laugh or that had a lot of jokes,simple
instead it was a play in which all the problems work out all right in the end,simple
this was unlike a tragedy where the problems do not work out usually resulting in someone 's death,simple
the two masks one was smiling the other crying often associated with theatre represent comedy and tragedy,simple
,simple
there are different types of comedy,simple
one type of comedy is called slap stick comedy,simple
in slap stick comedy people do silly things such as tripping falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh,simple
slap stick comedy can be used in comedy movies or comedy television shows,simple
slap stick comedy was used a lot in silent no sound movies from the s,simple
a comedian who acted in the silent movies who used a lot of slapstick comedy was charlie chaplin,simple
in the s and s comedian jerry lewis also used silly slap stick comedy in his comedy movies,simple
a comedy is a very popular type of movie,simple
some comedy movies have slapstick comedy in which people just do silly things such as tripping falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh,simple
other comedy movies show funny stories or situations in which people are behaving in a silly manner,simple
some comedies make the audience laugh by showing strange or unusual images or situations that do not make sense,simple
a parody or spoof movie imitates or exaggerates another person or movie to make them seem silly dumb or just plain out of it,simple
some types of comedy movies mix comedy with other types of movies,simple
there is a type of movie called a dramedy which is a mix of a drama movie and a comedy movie,simple
there is also a type of movie called a romantic comedy sometimes called a rom-com,simple
in romantic comedies there is a love story about a couple who fall in love along with silly or funny comedy parts,simple
comedy shows are very popular on television,simple
comedy shows on television are often called sitcoms,simple
the word sitcom is a shortened way of saying situational comedy,simple
television situational comedies usually show characters who do silly or funny things which make the audience laugh,simple

columbus then sailed to what is now cuba then to hispaniola,simple
on hispaniola columbus built a fort,simple
this was one of the first european military bases in the western hemisphere,simple
he called it navidad spanish for christmas,simple
he left thirty-nine crew members there and ordered them to find and store the gold,simple
on the day he landed in the bahamas columbus wrote about the arawaks and taíno : columbus noticed that some of the arawaks had gold earrings,simple
he took some of them as prisoners and ordered them to lead him to the gold,simple
however they could not,simple
according to encyclopædia britannica :,simple
on september columbus left spain with enough ships supplies and men to invade and make spanish colonies in the new world,simple
he had ships and men,simple
these men included soldiers and farmers,simple
there were also priests whose job was to convert the natives to christianity,simple
on this voyage columbus explored some of the islands of the lesser antilles,simple
he also sailed around most of hispaniola and explored the sides of jamaica and cuba he had not seen on his first voyage,simple
then he went back to the navidad fort,simple
he found the fort burned down,simple
eleven of the soldiers columbus left at the fort were buried there,simple
the rest had disappeared,simple
historians think this happened because of disease and fights with the arawak people,simple
while columbus was away from navidad exploring jamaica and cuba his soldiers stopped working on building a new fort and farms,simple
they made the arawaks give them food,simple
they also stole things from the arawaks and raped arawak women,simple
this made the arawaks decide to fight back against the spaniards,simple
however spain had many weapons that the arawaks had never seen including steel swords pikes crossbows dogs and horses,simple
this made it much easier for spain to win fights against the arawaks,simple
columbus also took revenge against the arawaks for killing his soldiers at navidad,simple
he made every native older than give him a certain amount of gold every three months,simple
if a person did not do this columbus 's men would cut off their hands and they would bleed to death,simple
historian carl lehrburger says that about natives died this way,simple
columbus also led his soldiers to many different villages in hispaniola to take them over and make them pay him gold also,simple
if they could not pay the gold people would be made into slaves or killed,simple
there was not much gold on the parts of the island columbus took over,simple
to avoid getting their hands cut off many arawaks tried to run away from columbus and his men,simple
however columbus 's soldiers used dogs to hunt them down and kill them,simple
bartolomé de las casas said that the spanish killed two out of every three native people in the area though he may have been exaggerating,simple
in february columbus started the transatlantic slave trade,simple
he and his soldiers captured about taíno,simple
only could fit on columbus 's ships so columbus told his men they could take any of the rest as slaves,simple
they took and let go,simple
of the natives that columbus shipped to spain as slaves about died on the trip,simple
half of the rest were very sick when they arrived,simple
this was the first time people had ever been shipped across the atlantic ocean to be sold as slaves,simple
michele da cuneo a friend of columbus 's helped capture natives as slaves,simple
in a letter da cuneo later wrote that columbus gave him a captured native woman to rape :,simple
columbus went on another voyage in,simple
king john ii of portugal had said there was a continent to the south-west of the cape verde islands,simple
on his third voyage columbus wanted to find this continent,simple
before the voyage queen isabella reminded columbus that he should treat all of the native people well and make them into christians,simple
on this voyage columbus sent three ships straight to the west indies the caribbean,simple
he led another three ships : first to two portuguese islands then to the canary islands then cape verde,simple
from cape verde they sailed to the northern coast of south america and landed in trinidad,simple
he also explored part of south america and the islands now called tobago and grenada,simple
on august columbus returned to hispaniola,simple
he found that many of the spanish settlers there were unhappy,simple
they thought there would be more gold in the new world,simple
some of them had rebelled while he was gone,simple
columbus had five of the rebellion 's leaders hanged,simple
he also tried to make the rest of the settlers happy by giving them land in hispaniola,simple
however the settlers kept sending complaints to spain,simple
in queen isabella sent a man named francisco de bobadilla to hispaniola,simple
she gave him the power to do whatever he thought he should do,simple
when he arrived in the first thing he did was to have columbus arrested and sent back to spain in chains,simple
when he was trying to make spanish settlers happy columbus started the encomienda system in hispaniola,simple
under this system columbus would give a piece of land in hispaniola to an individual spanish settler,simple
sometimes he would give away a whole native village,simple
any natives that lived in that area had to work for that spanish settler,simple
natives had lived on this land for centuries,simple
columbus was giving their land away and then forcing them to work on that land,simple
on august columbus was arrested in hispañola now called santo domingo for cruelty to natives and spaniards,simple
he was sent to spain in chains in october,simple
he was released on december and taken to court,simple
columbus had important friends and the king restored his freedom,simple
he was not made governor again but eventually he was allowed to lead another voyage,simple
columbus died of heart failure and arthritis in valladolid spain at the possible age of,simple
columbus 's relatives said that columbus was born in genoa italy,simple
today no historian can say for sure where columbus was born,simple
most experts think the best evidence says he was born in genoa,simple
however other historians think columbus was born somewhere else like spain or portugal,simple
some think he was originally a jew who converted to christianity,simple
columbus wrote that he first went to sea when he was years old,simple
in columbus married felipa moniz perestrelo,simple
she was from a semi-noble family with connections to sailing,simple
she died around or while giving birth to their son diego,simple
in while in córdoba spain columbus met beatriz enríquez de trasierra,simple
they lived together for a while,simple
they had one child named fernando,simple
columbus had a few different goals for his journeys to the new world,simple
first he believed he could find a shorter and easier route to asia which made things europe did not,simple
he believed he could find a shorter route to china,simple
other people had called this belief absurd,simple
columbus wanted to prove these people wrong,simple
second columbus wanted to find gold,simple
gold was the main kind of money used in columbus 's times,simple
in his letter to spain 's king ferdinand and queen isabella columbus wrote : “ gold is most excellent gold is treasure and [ the person ] who [ has ] it does all he wishes to in this world,simple
this means that someone with gold can do anything he wants to do,simple
many historians believe that columbus wanted to become a powerful person – and in order to become powerful he needed to find gold,simple
when the spanish learned about the new world many conquistadors or conquerors went there,simple
this led to the spanish colonization of the americas,simple
the spanish conquistadors first settled on the islands of hispaniola now the dominican republic and haiti cuba and puerto rico,simple
they grabbed as much gold as they could,simple
the spanish also brought priests and forced the native americans to convert to christianity,simple
in the united states columbus day is a holiday that celebrates columbus 's arrival in the new world on october,simple
the world 's columbian exposition which happened in in chicago illinois was held to celebrate the th anniversary of columbus visiting the americas,simple

yuri gagarin was born in the village of klushino near gzhatsk now in smolensk oblast russia on march,simple
the town next to gzhatsk was renamed gagarin in in his honour,simple
his parents alexey ivanovich gagarin and anna timofeyevna gagarina worked on a collective farm,simple
while manual workers are thought as peasants this may be too-simple if applied to his parents — his mother was said to love reading and his father was a skilled carpenter,simple
yuri was the third of four children and his elder sister helped raise him while his parents worked,simple
like millions of people in the soviet union the gagarin family suffered during the nazi invasion in world war ii,simple
his two elder siblings were sent out to nazi germany for slave work in and did not return until after the war,simple
while a youth yuri became interested in space and planets and began to dream about his space tour which would one day become a reality,simple
yuri was thought by his teachers as smart and hard-working sometimes mischievous,simple
his mathematics and science teacher had flown in the soviet air forces during the war which was said to make some impression on young gagarin,simple
after starting an apprenticeship in a metalworks as a foundryman gagarin was selected for further training at a technical high school in saratov,simple
while there he joined the flight club and learned to fly a light aircraft,simple
in after finishing his technical schooling he entered military flight training at the orenburg pilot 's school,simple
while there he met valentina goryacheva,simple
yuri married her in after gaining his pilot 's wings in a mig-,simple
post-graduation he was told to go to luostari airbase in murmansk oblast close to the norwegian border where bad weather made flying risky,simple
as a full-grown man gagarin was,simple
metres ft in tall which was an advantage in the small vostok cockpit,simple
he became a lieutenant of the soviet air force on november and on november he got the rank of senior lieutenant,simple
gagarin kept physically fit throughout his life and was a good sportsman,simple
as the space explorer valery bykovsky wrote : as well as being a good ice hockey player gagarin was also a basketball fan and coached the saratov industrial technical school team as well as being an umpire/referee,simple
,simple
in after the search and selection process yuri gagarin was selected with other space explorers for the soviet space program,simple
along with the other soon to be space explorers he was tested by experiments made to test his physical and psychological score he also underwent training for the upcoming flight,simple
out of the twenty originally selected the final choice for the first launch was between gagarin and gherman titov because of their performance in training as well as their physical fitness,simple
on april gagarin became the first man to travel into space launching to orbit aboard the vostok ka- vostok,simple
his call sign in this flight was kedr cedar russian : кедр,simple
during his flight gagarin famously whistled the song the motherland hears the motherland knows russian : родина слышит родина знает,simple
the first two lines of the song are : the motherland hears the motherland knows/where her son flies in the sky,simple
this song was written by dmitri shostakovich in opus with words by yevgeniy dolmatovsky,simple
around the same time some western people claimed that gagarin during his space flight had made the comment i do n't see any god up here,simple
however no such words appear in the direct record of gagarin 's talk with the earth during the spaceflight,simple
in a interview a close friend of gagarin colonel valentin petrov said that gagarin never said such words and that the phrase came from nikita khrushchev 's speech at the fullness of the central committee of the cpsu where the anti-religious propaganda was talked about,simple
in a certain context khrushchev said gagarin flew into space but did n't see any god there,simple
after the flight gagarin became a world famous celebrity,simple
he toured in many places like in italy the united kingdom germany canada and japan,simple
he did this to promote the soviet union achievements,simple
in he began serving as a deputy to the supreme soviet of the soviet union,simple
he later came back to star city,simple
while there he worked on designs for a reusable spacecraft,simple
gagarin worked on these designs in star city for seven years,simple
he became lieutenant colonel or podpolkovnik of the soviet air force on june,simple
then on november he got the rank of colonel polkovnik of the soviet air force,simple
soviet people tried to keep him away from any flights being worried of losing their hero in an accident,simple
gagarin was backup pilot for vladimir komarov in the soyuz flight,simple
as komarov 's flight ended in a deadly crash gagarin was banned from training for and helping out in further spaceflight/s,simple
gagarin then became deputy training director of the star city cosmonaut training base,simple
at the same time he began to re-join as a fighter pilot,simple
on march while on a routine training flight from chkalovsky air base he and flight instructor vladimir seryogin died in a mig-uti crash near the town of kirzhach,simple
gagarin and seryogin were buried in the walls of the kremlin on red square,simple
people are not sure what caused the crash but a investigation thinks that the turbulence from a su- 'fishpot-c ' interceptor using its afterburners may have caused gagarin 's plane to go out of control,simple
russian documents opened to the public in march showed that the kgb had changed their own investigation of the accident,simple
in addition to this one government and two military investigations,simple
the kgb 's report removed many conspiracy thoughts instead of showing the actions of air base personnel added to the crash,simple
the report says that an air traffic controller made gagarin have old weather information,simple
but by that time of his flight conditions had become very bad,simple
ground crew also left fuel tanks on the aircraft,simple
gagarin 's planned flight needed good weather and no outboard tanks,simple
the investigation ended saying that gagarin 's aircraft entered a spin either because of a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft,simple
because of the old weather report the crew thought their altitude to be higher than it actually was and could not properly react to bring the mig- out of its spin,simple
in his book two sides of the moon alexey leonov tells that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard two loud booms in the distance,simple
his thought was that the sukhoi jet was flying below its minimum allowed altitude and without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions he passed within or meters of yuri and seregin 's plane while breaking the sound barrier,simple
the resulting turbulence would have sent the mig into an uncontrolled spin,simple
leonov thinks the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier and the second was gagarin 's plane crashing,simple
space race,simple
on the sphere and cylinder is a work that was published by archimedes in two volumes in about bc,simple
on the sphere he showed that the surface area is four times the area of its great circle,simple
in modern terms this means that the surface area is equal to : a s = π r,simple
\displaystyle a_s=\pi r,simple
\,simple
the surface area of a cylinder is equal to : a c = π r π r h = π r r h,simple
\displaystyle a_c=\pi r\pi rh=\pi rrh,simple
\ the volume of the cylinder is : v c = π r h,simple
\displaystyle v_c=\pi rh,simple
\ the volume of the contained ball is two-thirds the volume of a circumscribed cylinder,simple
meaning that the volume is v s = π r \displaystyle v_s=\frac \pi r a sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of archimedes at his request,simple
archimedes is also well known for being the first person to understand statics which is a part of applied mathematics,simple
it has to do with loads that do not move for example in buildings or bridges,simple
he also understood and wrote about what happens when things float in liquids which is called buoyancy,simple
archimedes ' principle : the weight of water displaced by an object equals the amount of buoyancy it gets,simple
it has practical uses,simple
it can be used to measure the density of an object and hence whether or not it is made of gold,simple
the story of the golden crown does not appear in the surviving works of archimedes,simple
archimedes may have got a solution known in hydrostatics as archimedes ' principle which he describes in his treatise on floating bodies,simple
this principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces,simple
using this principle it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold reference sample then immersing the apparatus in water,simple
the difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly,simple
galileo considered it probable that this method is the same that archimedes followed since besides being very accurate it is based on demonstrations found by archimedes himself,simple
archimedes is also famous as an inventor because he made new tools and machines,simple
for example he made a machine to lift water that could be used by farmers to bring water to their crops,simple
this is called archimedes ' screw,simple
archimedes probably also invented a machine to measure distance an odometer,simple
a cart was built with wheels that turned four hundred times in one mile,simple
a pin on the wheel would hit a -tooth gear so it turned once for every mile,simple
this gear would then make a small stone fall into a cup,simple
at the end of a journey one could count the number of stones in the cup to find the distance,simple
archimedes also made a system which one person could pull a large ship with just one rope,simple
this was called the compound pulley,simple
this is an important machine which is even today helps people in everyday life although the versions we now use are much more complicated,simple
they still work by the same principle through,simple
archimedes also invented or made many machines used in war for example he made better catapults,simple
this was during the punic wars which were between rome in what is now italy and the city of carthage in what is now north africa,simple
for many years he helped stop the roman army from attacking syracuse his city,simple
one war machine was called the claw of archimedes or the iron hand,simple
it was used to defend the city from attacks by ships,simple
ancient writers said that it was a kind of crane with a hook that lifted ships out of the water and caused their destruction,simple
another story about archimedes is that he burned roman ships from far away using many mirrors and the light from the sun,simple
this is perhaps possible but it is perhaps more likely that this was done with flaming missiles from a catapult,simple
archimedes is thought to be so important as a mathematician that scientists have honoured him : a large hole or crater on the moon is named after archimedes,simple
some mountains on the moon are called the montes archimedes,simple

curie was born on november in warsaw poland,simple
she lived there until she was,simple
at the age of ten her sister zofia died,simple

marie curie was the fifth child in her family,simple
her original name was marya,simple
her father was a math teacher,simple
he died when she was,simple
as a young girl she was interested in physics,simple
she was top of her high school class,simple
she graduated at,simple
marie taught school so she could earn money to go to school in paris france,simple
she also went to an unaccredited college in poland,simple
eventually she left poland and traveled to france under the name “ marie,simple
” in paris she earned higher degrees and did her important scientific work,simple
she founded the curie institutes in paris and warsaw,simple
curie did many great things,simple
she and her husband created a theory of radioactivity a term made by her and her husband pierre curie,simple
they found different ways to separate radioactive isotopes and discovered two new elements : radium and polonium,simple
she used her own studies in radioactivity to develop a new treatment for cancer,simple
these treatments used the radioactive isotopes,simple
she was the first woman to win the nobel prize,simple
she was the first person to win two nobel prizes : one in physics and one in chemistry,simple
curie discovered radium,simple
it is one of the most radioactive and dangerous metals,simple
she shared this discovery with pierre curie and gustave bemont,simple
the three found radium in,simple
they discovered it when using a uranium ore,simple
it gave off a lot of radiation,simple
they decided that it was coming from more than uranium,simple
the group found radium in the uranium,simple
radium is now used for many different things,simple
for example doctors used to use it to kill cancer cells,simple
radium was found in paint and watches,simple
many workers who made radium-containing products developed bone cancer,simple
even though curie became a french citizen curie never lost her polish identity,simple
she graduated first in her class in,simple
one year later she earned a master ’ s degree in mathematics,simple
later she met her husband pierre at the municipal school of industrial physics and chemistry,simple
they were married in july,simple
they also started to work together on scientific discoveries,simple
marie and pierre had their first daughter irene in,simple
their second daughter eve was born in,simple
pierre died on april after he was hit by a horse-drawn wagon,simple
after the war marie started to raise money for a hospital,simple
the hospital raised money for radiation research,simple
she was invited to tour the united states to recommend and speed up her project,simple
she sailed for the united states in,simple
she collected enough money and equipment for a new laboratory,simple
she then started speaking at meetings to raise more money and became a celebrity,simple
she also supported world peace by serving on the council of the league of nations,simple
near the s curie and many of her colleagues began to suffer from symptoms of cancer,simple
curie began to lose her sight,simple
cataract surgeries to try to bring back her sight did not help,simple
curie knew that the element radium she discovered might have been causing the symptoms but she did not want to admit it to herself or others,simple
in the early s curie ’ s health started to quickly get worse,simple
doctors diagnosed her with pernicious anemia,simple
pernicious anemia is a blood anemia that happens when someone is overly exposed to radiation,simple
the doctors didn ’ t tell the public or curie herself what was going on,simple
on july at years old she died in a sanitorium at the french alps,simple
she was then buried next to her husband in sceaux france,simple
some people believe that galileo was the first person to build a telescope,simple
this is not true but he was the first person to publish his observations of astronomical objects through a telescope,simple
he discovered that the milky way is made of many stars,simple
he discovered that the moon has hills,simple
he found four moons around jupiter,simple
those moons are now called the galilean moons,simple
he discovered sunspots which are dark areas of the sun,simple
he saw that the planet venus has light and dark phases just like the moon,simple
this helped people to know that the sun is at the centre of the solar system as nicholas copernicus had said,simple
galileo also studied natural forces and was one of the most important discoverers of the part of physics that is now called kinematics including the discovery of kinematic relativity,simple
however he is often remembered now for things that either did n't happen or failed,simple
a legend says that he climbed the leaning tower of pisa and dropped cannonballs of different weights to see which would strike the ground first,simple
even though their weights were not the same they hit the ground at the same time,simple
galileo found that objects fall to the ground at the same rate unless things like wind resistance change the rate,simple
this went against the views of aristotle an ancient philosopher whose theory was different,simple
galileo 's findings were ignored by most people and aristotle 's view was still accepted as correct until isaac newton proved galileo was right,simple
this also led to newton creating his law of gravity,simple
galileo also tried to determine the speed of light,simple
he climbed a hill and had an assistant climb another hill both carrying lanterns with closed shutters,simple
he then opened the shutter of his lantern,simple
his assistant opened his own shutter when he saw galileo 's lantern,simple
galileo then measured the time it took for his assistant 's shutter to open,simple
knowing the time difference and the distance between the hills he tried to estimate the speed of light,simple
however this did not work,simple
galileo came to accept the findings of copernicus that the sun was the center of the then-known universe and not the earth,simple
because he promoted this and other ideas he came to the notice of the committee of propaganda the dreaded inquisition,simple
the church taught that the earth stood still while everything in the sky moved around it,simple
the inquisition ruled in that other theories could only be discussed as possibilities not facts,simple
galileo said he would obey,simple
he played a major part in the scientific revolution through this argument,simple
galileo later discussed the question in his most famous work dialogue concerning the two chief world systems published in by permission of the inquisition,simple
his scientific writing was usually in latin for hundreds of scientists around europe but this was one of the books he wrote in italian so thousands of italians could read it,simple
the book was in the form of conversations between three men,simple
the man representing the church 's point of view was called 'simplicio ',simple
church leaders who liked his earlier books were angry at this one,simple
the inquisition took action in,simple
he was arrested and put on trial,simple
they found him vehemently suspect of heresy,simple
they reminded him of the fate of giordano bruno who had been burnt at the stake for heresy on topics such as transubstantiation and the trinity,simple
bruno also believed the earth went round the sun and stars had planets,simple
the inquisition forced galileo to recant say he was wrong under the threat of execution and to withdraw his works from publication,simple
galileo spent the last ten years of his life under house arrest,simple
galileo continued to write about physics and other topics but not astronomy,simple

nietzsche wrote a lot about how people make decisions and about how they live their lives,simple
he attacked most of the moral ideas that were popular at the time because he did not believe that there are any real facts about what is right or wrong,simple
he thought people should create their own facts about morality,simple
he also often attacked the ideas of the christian religion - he believed that the christian idea that one should feel pity when one sees weakness was unhelpful,simple
according to him weak people rely on other people 's love as a way of protecting themselves,simple
nietzsche believed that people should be stronger than that,simple
he thought that people should be very aware of their body and of the real world in which they actually live,simple
he told his readers not to live in a daydream or make decisions based on unrealistic thoughts,simple
he believed that ideas of heaven came from an inability to cope with life in the world,simple
nietzsche considered the world to be one connected thing including mankind and nature,simple
he invented the idea of the will to power,simple
this idea is that everyone and everything is trying to overcome itself or defeat or take control from itself,simple
therefore if the world is just one thing this is the force that makes the world,simple
nietzsche thought that human beings would be successful at overcoming themselves and he thought that when they did they would be different and better,simple
he named the person who would do this someday a superman or übermensch in german,simple
he thought that the supermen would be stronger than normal humans and not restricted by other people 's ideas of right and wrong,simple
adolf hitler the german chancellor and leader of the nazis in world war ii read nietzsche 's work,simple
some people say that hitler did not understand nietzsche 's ideas but he used them to try to show that his actions were right,simple
hitler and benito mussolini used the term übermensch to refer to the aryan race,simple
however he was not popular among all fascists,simple
nietzsche wrote in a very fiery and exciting way,simple
however what he wrote later in his life became more and more odd,simple
when he was forty years old nietzsche went insane,simple
supposedly one day in the city of turin italy he saw a horse being whipped by its owner and ran to save it hugging it around the throat,simple
after this nietzsche never wrote again and could not look after himself,simple
this illness may have been caused by the disease syphillis or a brain tumour,simple
his writing and ideas are still popular and of interest to academics and intellectuals,simple
in the late s georg brandes developed a philosophy called aristocratic radicalism inspired by nietzsche 's idea of the overman,simple
nietzsche is associated with anarchism but his writing seems to have a negative opinion of anarchists,simple
anarcha-feminist emma goldman was deeply influenced by his work,simple

in bc philip assembled a large macedonian army and invaded thrace,simple
he left year old alexander with the power to rule macedonia in his absence as regent,simple
but as the macedonian army advanced deep into thrace the thracian tribe of maedi bordering north-eastern macedonia rebelled and posed a danger to the country,simple
alexander assembled an army led it against the rebels and with swift action defeated the maedi captured their stronghold and renamed it alexandropolis,simple
alexander became king of macedonia in bc when his father was assassinated,simple
a meeting was held to the of greek cities made him strategos general or supreme commander,simple
he used this authority to launch his father 's military expansion plans,simple
in bc he invaded persian-ruled asia minor,simple
he began series of campaigns that lasted ten years,simple
alexander broke the power of persia in a series of decisive battles most notably the battles of issus and gaugamela,simple
he overthrew the persian king darius iii and conquered the entire persian empire,simple
at that point alexander 's empire stretched from the adriatic sea to the indus river,simple
he attacked india in bc and defeated king porus who ruled a region in the punjab,simple
afterwards they became allies,simple
india at that time was divided into hundreds of kingdoms,simple
the army refused to cross the indus and fight the kings on the other side so alexander led them out of india,simple
alexander died in babylon in bc of unknown causes,simple
poison murder or a fever after a battle have all been suggested,simple
at his death he was planning a series of campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of arabia,simple
in the years following his death a series of civil wars tore his empire apart,simple
several states were then ruled by the diadochi alexander 's surviving generals and heirs,simple
they fought and conquered each other,simple
the largest surviving piece was the seleucid empire,simple
alexander 's legacy includes the cultural diffusion of greek ideas and language,simple
he founded some twenty cities that was named after him most notably alexandria in egypt,simple
alexander 's settlement of greek colonists resulted in a new hellenistic civilization,simple
signs of this can be seen in the byzantine empire in the mid-th century ad,simple
there were greek speakers in central and far eastern anatolia until the s,simple

octavian as he was originally called was the adopted son of the dictator of the roman republic julius caesar,simple
octavian came into power in the second triumvirate,simple
this was three men ruling over the roman republic : mark antony lepidus and octavian,simple
all three were loyal to julius caesar the assassinated dictator killed in bc,simple
following his death a civil war broke out across rome between those loyal to caesar and the conspirators led by two of caesar 's assassins brutus and cassius,simple
at first octavian was the junior partner in the triumvirate,simple
lepidus was more experienced in government and mark antony was a fine military leader,simple
the triumvirate defeated brutus and cassius at the battle of philippi bc largely due to antony 's leadership,simple
then they split the leadership of the republic three ways,simple
antony took the east lepidus took spain and part of north africa and octavian took italy,simple
antony followed in caesar 's footsteps by going to egypt and becoming cleopatra 's lover,simple
they had three children together,simple
his absence from rome allowed the intelligent octavian to build up support,simple
the triumvirate broke up in bc and disagreement turned to civil war in bc,simple
antony was defeated by octavian at the naval battle of actium and then at alexandria,simple
he committed suicide as did his lover cleopatra vii of egypt in bc,simple
lepidus was sidelined blamed for a revolt in sicily and removed from government,simple
he died peacefully in exile in circeii in italy in the year bc,simple

siddhārtha gautama sidaaha was born in the kingdom of kapilvastu in nepal,simple
at present this birthplace of buddha is called lumbini in nepal,simple
at that time a clan called the shakya 's ruled kapilvastu,simple
his father was a king named suddodana tharu and his mother was maya devi,simple
siddhārtha lived in luxury his father kept trouble and hard work far from him,simple
a seer predicted that if siddhārth stayed inside his palace his whole life then he would become a great king,simple
however if he left the palace then he would become a great religious leader,simple
the king did not want his son to become a religious leader,simple
he kept siddhartha in the palace for his whole childhood,simple
when he was older his father found a woman for siddhārtha to marry at the age of,simple
he married the woman named yashodhara and they had a son rahul,simple
although gautama had everything he could want he still was not happy,simple
he wanted to learn the meaning of his existence,simple
it is said that he got out of the castle against his father 's orders,simple
he saw the four great sights : an old crippled man a sick man a dead man and a holy man with no home,simple
but in real he became member of shakya sangh in age of,simple
after eight years shakya and koli dispute happened,simple
which was about the use of water of river rohini,simple
some people of both the sides got injured,simple
after it in a meeting of shakya sangh they decided to fight a war against kolis to teach them lesson,simple
siddhartha opposed the proposal and said war is not a solution of any problem we can form a council of some people of both sides and that council can solve the issues,simple
almost all the members rejected his opinion,simple
next day head of the sangh said we are going to recruit new soldiers for the war and it is essential for a man who is above and below years,simple
again siddhartha opposed the proposal,simple
head of the sangh made him recall his oath but siddharth said he will not fight,simple
sangh asked him to choose fight for the sangh against kolis death sentence or he will leave the country social boycott of his family,simple
siddhartha said i am ready for death,simple
head of the sangh said this step can be harmful because kosala king will not allow it,simple
if it is your problem then i may become a monk and then i can leave this country kosala king cant do anything in it said siddhartha,simple
head of the sangh thought it was a good idea,simple
after you leave we will start a war so that king will not be able to findout any relation between you and war head of the sangh said,simple
next day siddhartha left his family his land and everything,simple
it was th year of his birth,simple
at that time holy men were usually ascetics,simple
they hurt their bodies in order to help their spiritual beings,simple
they do not do things they like so they can defeat their desires,simple
the most ascetic kinds of holy men were called jains,simple
they practiced self-denial and made themselves suffer very much,simple
they believed this would free the ātman soul from pain and sadness,simple
siddhārth did these things well,simple
eventually he was better than his teachers,simple
he still found no answer and he left his teachers some friends and he went even farther,simple
he ate only six grains of rice a day,simple
he tried holding his breath,simple
he became just skin and bones and he nearly died,simple
still he had no answer,simple
siddhārth started to think again about this path,simple
he thought there might be a better way than hurting himself,simple
he found a fig tree now called the bodhi tree and started to meditate,simple
he told himself that he would not get up until he had found enlightenment,simple
he meditated under the tree for days,simple
his mind is said to have become pure and then six years after he began his path he said he found enlightenment and became the buddha,simple
when the buddha became enlightened he knew the answer to suffering and he knew how to defeat suffering,simple
this answer was called the four noble truths,simple
he was not sure if he should teach his new ideas or not,simple
he asked himself if the world was ready for such a deep teaching,simple
but in the end he decided to travel to a town called sarnath to teach the people his new way,simple
he taught about the four noble truths and the noble eightfold path,simple
the people listened to him,simple
when he taught he did not pretend to be a god,simple
he said he was just a man who had found the meaning of life enlightenment and that any person can also find the meaning of life,simple
for the rest of his life he walked all over southern nepal and parts of india to teach people what he believed,simple
he started a sangha which is a group of buddhist monks and nuns,simple
many people became enlightened because of him,simple
at the age of gautama buddha died,simple
the teachings of the buddha are known as buddhism,simple
buddhism is mostly about ending the feeling of pain that all people feel inside,simple
gautama buddha taught that pain is a part of all life,simple
he taught that pain is because of desire,simple
and he showed that there is a way to end desire and end pain by doing good things not doing bad things and training one 's mind,simple
this is done to end pain and gain enlightenment,simple
buddhism teaches non-harm and balance – not going too far one way or the other,simple
the buddha taught people to meditate or think deeply while sitting in the lotus position,simple
some buddhists chant and meditate while walking,simple
buddhists sometimes do these things to understand the human heart and mind,simple
sometimes they do these things to understand the way the world works,simple
sometimes they do these things to find peace,simple
the buddha would not say if gods exist or not,simple
he taught that people should not look to gods to save them or bring them enlightenment,simple
the gods may have power over world events and they might help people or they might not,simple
but buddha believed that it is up to each person to become enlightened,simple
buddhism seokbosangjeol,simple
the name jesus came from the aramaic name yeshua from hebrew yah-shua meaning god is salvation or deliverance in english and was a popular name of the time,simple
jesus is often called jesus christ or christ,simple
the word christ comes from the greek word christos and means the one marked on the head with oil or the anointed one,simple
in jesus ' country anointing was done to show that a person was chosen to be a king or a leader,simple
jesus is also called messiah which comes from the hebrew term moshiach and also means the anointed one,simple
,simple
the gospels of matthew and luke say that before the birth of jesus both mary his mother and the man that she was promised to joseph knew that jesus was going to be the messiah or king that had been promised to the jewish people in the ancient jewish books,simple
luke 's gospel tells most of the story,simple
when jesus was born the roman empire ruled most of the middle east,simple
the government wanted every single family to have their name taken down to be taxed so everyone had to go back to the place where they came from,simple
joseph came from the small town of bethlehem near jerusalem so even though mary was close to giving birth to her baby they had to travel with thousands of other people,simple
when they got to bethlehem every room was full,simple
jesus was placed in a manger as there was no room for them at the inn,simple
shepherds who were minding their sheep on the hillside came in to see the baby and went away singing thanks to god for the newborn king,simple
in the gospel of matthew it says that wise men from a far country saw a new star in the sky and traveled to find the young jesus because they knew that the messiah was going to be born under a star and that the star was a sign that jesus was born to be a king,simple
most christians celebrate the day that jesus was born as the holiday of christmas,simple
although the gospels do not say what day jesus was born the date chosen was of december because there was already a roman holiday on that day,simple
the arrival of jesus was prophesied by john the baptist,simple
he baptized jesus in the jordan river,simple
during the baptism the spirit of god like a dove came down upon jesus and the voice of god was heard,simple
according to the bible the spirit led jesus into the desert where he fasted for days,simple
there he resisted the devil 's temptations,simple
then jesus went into galilee settled in capernaum and began to preach about the kingdom of god,simple
he was about years old,simple
jesus taught mainly by telling stories,simple
he taught that god alone was the true king and that people should love god and love each other as the scriptures told them to do,simple
and he taught his followers how to pray,simple
jesus performed miracles that were signs of god 's power such as giving hungry people food and wine healing sick people and making dead people alive again,simple
he also set people free from evil spirits,simple
jesus gathered together twelve men known as the twelve apostles whom he chose and trained to spread his message,simple
he had many other disciples including many women but because of jewish customs the women disciples could not travel to distant places on their own as teachers,simple
the bible says jesus became famous,simple
he went to jerusalem where many were visiting the city for passover,simple
when they heard that he was coming they greeted him as if he was a king,simple
they thought he would free them from the roman rule but jesus rode into jerusalem on a donkey as a sign that he came in peace,simple
jesus did certain things which upset the jewish religious leaders,simple
they thought he showed disrespect for customs that the jews had kept for many centuries,simple
for example jews did no work at all on the th day of the week the sabbath because it was a holy day,simple
in john 's gospel chapter there is the story of jesus healing a crippled man,simple
jesus saw a man lying on a mattress,simple
he healed the man and told him to pick up the mattress and go home,simple
carrying the mattress on the sabbath was against religious custom so the religious leaders argued with jesus about it,simple
they then watched everything he did and remembered all the things that were against the religious customs,simple
in mark 's gospel chapter it says that when jesus arrived in jerusalem he went to the jewish temple,simple
he became angry at what he saw,simple
there were people selling things there and money lenders who were cheating poor people,simple
jesus chased away all the people who were selling things,simple
he said the chief priests and scribes had turned the temple into a den of thieves because they were making money from the poor and taking away homes from poor women who had no other way to pay for the temple worship,simple
the gospels say that the temple leaders were angry and wanted to kill him,simple
they told the roman government that jesus ' followers wanted him to become the king of the country and take it over,simple
the gospels say the roman governor thought that jesus should be set free but that the jewish leaders said if you do that then you are not the friend of caesar caesar was the roman ruler,simple
the governor sentenced him to death because his followers had claimed he was king,simple
the roman soldiers killed jesus by crucifixion,simple
he was nailed up to a high cross by his hands and feet,simple
this was a common way for the romans to kill rebels and criminals,simple
jesus ' body was buried in a tomb which belonged to one of his followers,simple
on the day after the sabbath early in the morning women went to treat the body with spice and perfumed oil,simple
but the gospels say that the body of jesus was gone and that he was seen alive afterwards,simple
this is called the resurrection,simple
some people like the disciple thomas said i 'm not going to believe this until i have seen it with my own eyes but the bible says that more than people including thomas saw jesus alive again,simple
there are many stories in the gospels about what jesus did after he was resurrected,simple
finally the gospel of luke says that jesus took his disciples to a hill where he blessed them and told them to spread his teaching through all the world and that then clouds came down and he was lifted up to heaven,simple
most christians celebrate the time that the gospels say he died and was raised from the dead as the holiday of easter,simple
the christian church is founded on jesus,simple
the things that christians believe about jesus are based on the four gospels of the bible and on letters or epistles that were written in the st century explaining jesus ' teachings to his followers,simple
jesus did not write these letters,simple
they were mainly written by a jewish man named paul,simple
at first he tried to stop christianity from spreading,simple
then he became a christian himself and was an important leader,simple
as christian churches started in different towns and countries paul wrote letters to them,simple
a lot of the ideas that christians believe are written in paul 's letters,simple
there is also lots of instruction for running churches and families,simple
there are other letters in the new testament by other writers including peter james and john,simple
these letters all help to build the beliefs that modern christians have,simple
see section : other views about jesus,simple
whether or not jesus is god has been argued about for a long time,simple
most christians including those from catholic orthodox and protestant denominations believe jesus was both god and man,simple
jesus is described in different parts of the new testament as being the word of god the son of god the son of man and god himself,simple
these teachings which are believed by most christians are not believed by many other people,simple
the islamic teaching is that jesus was a prophet but he was not part of god or the son of god,simple
in jesus ' own time many jews became very angry at jesus for saying that he was the son of god and also because his followers said he was the messiah,simple
most jews do not believe this,simple
these bible verses tell the christian teaching that jesus is god : in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god,simple
he was in the beginning with god,simple
john : - esvand the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory glory as of the only son from the father full of grace and truth,simple
john : esv i and the father are one,simple
john : esvto them belong the patriarchs and from their race according to the flesh is the christ who is god over all blessed forever,simple
amen,simple
romans : esvwaiting for our blessed hope the appearing of the glory of our great god and savior jesus christ,simple
titus : esvfor in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,simple
colossians : esvjesus is also referred to as the son of god,simple
and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory glory as of the only son from the father full of grace and truth,simple
john : esvbut in these last days he has spoken to us by his son whom he appointed the heir of all things through whom also he created the world,simple
he is the radiance of the glory of god and the exact imprint of his nature and he upholds the universe by the word of his power,simple
after making purification for sins he sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high hebrews : - esvand we know that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are in him who is true in his son jesus christ,simple
he is the true god and eternal life,simple
john : esv,simple
this letter is thought to be by the same john that wrote john 's gospel,simple
many christians believe that these verses say jesus is god,simple
all christians believe that jesus ' death on the cross allows all people to be forgiven by god for their sins bad things they have done,simple
most christians believe that if a person asks god to forgive them he will do so and they will get to live forever with him in heaven,simple
many christians believe that by the teaching of the bible jesus was not only truly god but also truly human and that this was part of god 's plan to bring humans closer to understanding him,simple
people who do not have christian beliefs have different ideas about jesus,simple
verses from the bible : - and the word became flesh and dwelt among us,simple
john : in matthew 's gospel jesus is often called the son of man,simple
matthew has borrowed these words from the old testament where they are often used to show that humankind is very far from god,simple
in the bible god is often praised and thanked for helping ordinary humans who are called the sons of man,simple
in psalm the writer king david asks god what is man that you are mindful of him and the son of man that you care for him ? in matthew 's gospel : jesus says then will appear in heaven the sign of the son of man and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory,simple
like king david in psalm jesus is making a difference between his ordinary human life and his great power as the son of god,simple
one of the best-loved parts of the old testament is a song called psalm,simple
it starts : the lord is my shepherd i shall not want,simple
he makes me lie down in green pastures,simple
he leads me beside still waters,simple
in the gospels jesus often spoke about himself as being like a shepherd caring for sheep,simple
he called himself the good shepherd who would even give his own life to protect his sheep,simple
he told the jewish people referring to non-jewish or gentile believers that he had other sheep that do not belong to this flock,simple
john :,simple
in one of his last conversations with his disciple peter he told him feed my sheep in other words take care of my people,simple
in judaism from ancient times people are seen as sinful or bad,simple
they need to be forgiven by god,simple
they believed that there were two ways to get god 's forgiveness by prayer and by sacrifice,simple
prayer could be done anywhere but sacrifices were done at the temple,simple
a person would bring an animal often a lamb or if they were poor a dove,simple
they would put their hands on the animal to lay their sins on it,simple
then the animal would be killed as a punishment for the sin,simple
this type of sacrifice continued until the temple in jerusalem was destroyed in ad,simple
paying money to the temple was also a sort of sacrifice,simple
when jesus drove the traders out of the temple they were the people who sold lambs and doves and the people who exchanged roman money into special temple money,simple
part of christian belief is that jesus christ did not just come as a human person so that he could teach a better way of life,simple
christians also believe that jesus was the ultimate sacrifice for the sin of humankind that jesus is the saviour : the one who is here to save,simple
christians believe that unlike ordinary people jesus was completely pure and free from sin but that when he died on the cross he took on himself all the sins of every person who would believe in him like the lamb sacrificed in the temple,simple
based on john 's gospel christian teaching is that the death and resurrection of jesus are the sign of his power to forgive the sins of any person who turns to him and truly asks for forgiveness,simple
the bible says that sinners who are forgiven should try to live a new life and not go back to their sinful behaviour,simple
christians believe that knowing about god 's love helps people to live a new and better life,simple
these are three verses from the bible that are important in this christian belief : - for god so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life,simple
john 's gospel :,simple
jesus said to him “ i am the way and the truth and the life,simple
no one comes to the father except through me,simple
john 's gospel :,simple
if we say we have no sins we are fooling ourselves and not telling the truth,simple
but if we tell our sins humbly to god then he has promised to listen and to forgive our sins and make us clean from all our badness,simple
from the first letter of john,simple

some people who are not christians believe that jesus lived at the time that the gospels say but do not believe that jesus was the son of god or savior,simple
they believe that jesus was an ordinary but very good person a teacher and perhaps a prophet,simple
mohandas gandhi said i am a muslim and a hindu and a christian and a jew even though he was born a jain,simple
muslims believe jesus under the name isa was the second-to-last prophet messenger of god,simple
they believe that muhammad was the very last prophet,simple
they believe that both jesus and muhammad were ordinary men chosen by god to be his servant and teach the word of islam,simple
muslims do not believe that jesus was god or the son of god,simple
islam is strictly monotheistic : it says that there is only one god,simple
muslims believe that jesus can not be part of god because there is only one god,simple
if someone other than god is worshiped it is thought to be polytheism belief in more than one god,simple
it is also thought to be idolatry : idolizing someone other than god,simple
islam teaches that jesus did not die on the cross but another man disguised as him went on the cross for isa qur'an :,simple
this is very different from christianity,simple
jesus ' death is a very important part of the christian belief about salvation,simple
muslims always say peace be upon him after saying jesus ' name as a sign of respect in short and arabic a,simple
muslims also accept some other teachings about jesus,simple
these teachings say that jesus will return to the earth in the end of days he will then destroy the false messiah or anti-christ before the day of judgment,simple
muslims also accept jesus ' claims to be a healer,simple
they believe in the many miracles he is said to have performed like raising the dead to life and giving sight to the blind,simple
they believe that all his miracles were granted to him from god,simple
the qur'an like the bible mentions the virgin birth of jesus but then it says other things about mary islamic-maryam,simple
the bible says that joseph helped mary give birth to jesus but in islam there is no joseph,simple
instead mary walked the desert alone in labor and found a tree,simple
the angel gabriel jibreel asked if she was hungry then told her to shake the tree and dates fell for her to eat,simple
then he asked if she was thirsty and he said look down at your feet and there was water and there she gave birth to jesus,simple
qur'an this is why muslims fast and how they break their fast,simple
mary knew she had to go back to her town and when she did with jesus in her arms the people were shouting at her for adultery,simple
mary wanted to explain herself but the angel told her not to speak,simple
even though jesus was a jew and his teaching came out of the jewish religion most jewish people do not believe that jesus was the messiah that is promised in the jewish scriptures,simple
in the gospels it tells that jesus made the jewish teachers very angry with his teachings,simple
it says that part of their anger was because he told them they were hypocrites which means that they externally made themselves appear to be living a holy life but internally their hearts were far from god 's,simple
in the gospels the other reason that they became angry was that jesus acted as if he was the messiah and said he was the son of god,simple
this meant that he was either a terrible liar that he was mad and just imagined it or that it was true,simple
but jesus did not seem to be mad,simple
so that left only two choices,simple
if jesus was lying then he was doing something badly against the jewish religion,simple
it was because of the claims that jesus was the son of god that some of the jewish leaders wanted him killed and they handed him to the roman rulers,simple
the romans did not care if jesus said something that was against the jewish beliefs,simple
but they knew that people had also said that jesus was king of the jews,simple
the jewish leaders claimed this was against the roman government 's laws,simple
although the roman leaders did not agree they had him killed to prevent a possible riot,simple
although today and through history most jews do not believe what christians say about jesus there are some jews who do believe that jesus was the messiah promised in the jewish scriptures,simple
jews who believe this are called messianic jews,simple
nearly all modern scholars both christian and non-christian agree that jesus was a real person,simple
both christian and non-christian scholars base their studies of him on the gospels,simple
they are believed to have been written between - ad,simple
by tradition the gospels were written by four men matthew mark luke and john who gave their names to these books,simple
this is the order in which they are arranged in the new testament of the bible but scholars think that it is not the order in which they were written,simple
the gospel of mark was probably written before the gospel of matthew,simple
the four gospels all tell the story of the life of jesus but they do it from four different points of view because they were written by different people and each writer had reasons to tell it in a different way,simple
other scholars have said that leaders in the early christian church made changes to the gospel writings,simple
these changes are said to have happened at different times in different ways and for different reasons,simple
for example one story was left out of many old versions of the gospels,simple
it is about jesus rescuing a woman who had committed adultery had sex outside marriage and was about to be killed,simple
st,simple
augustine of hippo - ad wrote that this was probably was left out because some church leaders thought the story might cause people to act in a sinful way,simple
this story is in all modern bibles and is thought to contain very important teaching for christians,simple
other differences that can be found in versions of the gospels are mostly small and do not make a difference to what is known about the life of jesus and his teaching,simple
mark 's gospel which is thought by biblical scholars to be the earliest has the name of a young disciple of the apostle paul who is mentioned several times in the acts of the apostles and paul 's letters,simple
the gospel was probably written in rome and is thought by scholars to be from the memories of jesus ' follower or disciple peter,simple
it does not tell about jesus ' birth it starts when he was years old at the time when the disciples got to know him,simple
it shows jesus as a man of action : going around the country teaching and healing people,simple
matthew 's gospel was written next,simple
matthew was one of jesus ' disciples,simple
he was a jewish man that was hated by other jews because he worked for the roman rulers as a tax collector,simple
matthew tells that one day jesus saw him sitting at his desk in the market place and said follow me,simple
most biblical scholars believe that matthew had read mark 's gospel and decided to fill in some things that mark left out because while mark wrote his gospel for the church of rome matthew wanted to write for jewish christians all over the roman empire,simple
matthew was a well-educated jew so he knew the jewish scriptures which christians also use and call the old testament of the bible,simple
matthew knew the scripture teachings that the messiah or god 's anointed one would come,simple
in his gospel he often mentions these teachings,simple
he also starts off by giving a list of jesus ' ancestors because this was important to jewish readers,simple
the apostle luke was greek and a friend of the apostle paul,simple
he was a doctor,simple
luke came to know about jesus from the disciples,simple
luke writes about the birth and the childhood of jesus and he says mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them,simple
luke was not a jew and he writes in a way that is easy for other people who are not jews to understand,simple
he explains jewish customs and laws,simple
he wrote a second book called the acts of the apostles which tells what the disciples did after jesus had left them,simple
it is believed by scholars of the bible that john was a disciple of jesus and was probably the youngest of the twelve men who were jesus ' main followers,simple
he lived to be an old man and because of his teaching about jesus he was sent to a small island called patmos,simple
john writes with one particular idea in mind,simple
he wants to prove to the reader that jesus is god 's way of saving humans from the terrible problem of sin or evil,simple
john starts by telling the reader that jesus was and is god,simple
john says that jesus is god 's living communication or living word,simple
every part of john 's gospel is written to show that jesus came from god taught the message of god and is the way for people to understand god 's love,simple
the gospels tell many of the stories that jesus told when he was teaching people about the way that god loved them and the way they should live,simple
these are called parables,simple
they include the following :,simple
in this story from chapter of luke 's gospel jesus shows what it means to be a good neighbour,simple
near the jews lived the people called samaritans,simple
they did not agree with each other about religious teaching and were considered enemies,simple
one day a jewish man was walking when some robbers beat him up robbed him and left him naked and almost dead by the road,simple
a jewish priest came along and saw him,simple
he thought if i touch that naked bleeding man i will be unclean and i will not be able to go to the temple so he pretended that he had not seen him,simple
another jew a holy man came along and acted in the same way,simple
at last a samaritan came along with a donkey,simple
when he saw the wounded man he stopped,simple
he washed his wounds with wine and olive oil,simple
then he put him on his donkey and took him to the nearest inn,simple
he paid the innkeeper and said keep him until he is well and whatever is owing i will pay when i come back this way,simple
jesus said to the people who were listening which one of these people acted like a good neighbour ? they said he that stopped and helped,simple
jesus said you go and act the same way,simple
in this story from chapter of luke 's gospel jesus tells how a rich man had two sons,simple
they would both get a share of his money when he died,simple
the younger son said father give me my money now so i can go and enjoy myself while i 'm young,simple
he took the money to the city and spent it all on parties with his friends and other sinful things,simple
soon he had none left to feed himself and was ashamed,simple
he got a job caring for pigs a unholy meat to eat just keep himself from starving,simple
he said to himself i 'll go home to my father and i will say 'father i have sinned please let me be a servant in your house ' when his father saw him coming he ran along the road to put his arms around his son,simple
the father said bring the finest clothes kill the fattest calf to make a feast when the elder brother heard all this he was angry and said i 'm a good son to you but you never even gave me one little goat to have a party with my friends the father said you have always been with me,simple
i love you greatly and all i have is yours but my son who was lost is now found my son who seemed to be dead is alive be happy with me jesus said that this is the way god loves and forgives his people when they ask for forgiveness,simple

knowledge in religion is different in that it depends on faith belief and the authority of religious leaders not on evidence of a scientific or legal kind,simple
there are differing views on whether religious statements should be regarded as knowledge,simple
in many expressions of christianity such as catholicism and anglicanism knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the holy spirit,simple
in the garden of eden knowledge is the factor that made humans greedy and treacherous,simple
but in the book of proverbs it states : 'to be wise you must first obey the lord ' :,simple
in islam knowledge has great significance,simple
the all-knowing al-ʿalīm is one of the names of god reflecting distinct properties of god in islam,simple
the qur'an asserts that knowledge comes from god : and various hadith encourage getting knowledge,simple
muhammad is reported to have said seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave and verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets,simple
islamic scholars theologians and jurists are often given the title alim meaning 'knowledgeable ',simple
== references ==,simple
many people have asked themselves if god exists,simple
philosophers theologians and others have tried to prove that it exists and others have tried to disprove the theory,simple
in philosophical terminology such arguments are about the epistemology of the ontology of god,simple
the debate exists mainly in philosophy as science does not address whether or not supernatural things exist,simple
there are many philosophical issues with the existence of god,simple
some definitions of god are not specific,simple
arguments for the existence of god typically include metaphysical empirical inductive and subjective types,simple
some theories are built around holes in evolutionary theory as well as order and complexity in the world,simple
arguments against the existence of god typically include empirical deductive and inductive arguments,simple
conclusions sometimes include : god does not exist strong atheism god almost certainly does not exist de facto atheism no one knows whether god exists agnosticism god exists but this can not be proven or disproven deism or theism and god exists and this can be proven theism,simple
there are many variations on these positions and sometimes different names for some of them,simple
for example the position god exists and this can be proven is sometimes called gnostic theism or strong theism,simple
there are different names for god in different religions,simple
some examples are yahweh elohim in judaism and christianity allah in islam baha in bahá'í faith and ahura mazda in zoroastrianism,simple
by the year approximately of the world 's population were part of one of the three main abrahamic religions christian islam less than judaism with buddhism with hinduism with traditional chinese religion with various other religions and less than as non-religious,simple
most of these religious beliefs involve god or gods,simple
abrahamic religions are very popular monotheistic ones,simple
well-known abrahamic religions include judaism christianity and islam,simple
monotheistic means the people in these religions believe there is only one god,simple
the name of god is usually not allowed to be said in judaism but some jews today call him yhwh yahweh or jehovah,simple
muslims say the word allah which is the arabic word for god,simple
believers in the abrahamic religions except islamic believers believe that god has created human beings in his image but this idea is not easily understood by humankind,simple
one artistic idea is that of an wise elder man in use since the renaissance,simple
the christian holy bible talks about god in different ways,simple
within christian canon the old testament talks about god the father whilst the new testament is about jesus or god the son,simple
many christians believe that jesus was god 's incarnation on earth,simple
christians consider the holy spirit to be god as well the third person of god,simple
in the new testament there are three beings who are said to be god in different forms : the father the son and the holy spirit also known as the holy ghost,simple
this is called the holy trinity,simple
although the word trinity is not in the bible the word used for god in chapter one of genesis is actually plural and the phrase in the name of the father son and holy spirit ' is used in the new testament e,simple
g,simple
matthew :,simple
another word that christians believe has exactly the same meaning as trinity is the word godhead which is in the holy bible,simple
christians believe that god incarnated in a human body through the normal birth process normally growing up into a man named jesus or yeshua coming to earth specifically to give every person an opportunity of salvation from their own evil called sin,simple
the effect of personal evil far transcends the repercussions humans cause to one another in the world but affects one 's relationship with god the father and that aspect of the self can not be addressed through one 's own self-improvement efforts but requires god to intervene in order to set one right,simple
when jesus prayed and talked to god he called him father and taught others to do the same,simple
jesus also taught that one must be born again in order to receive god 's spirit otherwise one remains separated from god acting merely from their own mind thus being vulnerable to deception by human philosophies or the many spiritual philosophies which do not come from god but from fallen angels which are within various false religions,simple
after a person consciously accepts the free gift of eternal life which jesus 's sacrifice offers god comes to live in the individual as god lived in humankind before the fall,simple
in hinduism there is only one god named brahman but brahman is said to have taken on many different incarnations,simple
some of these are rama krishna buddha shiva kali parvati and durga,simple
to many outsiders the worship of god 's different incarnations is considered to be the worship of many gods,simple
however it is really only the worship of one god in different ways,simple
some hindus also believe that the spirit of god lives in everyone,simple
this idea is called advaita vedanta which is the hindu term for monism,simple
religions like buddhism and confucianism involve the worship of many gods or sometimes no gods at all,simple
philosophers can talk about god or god sometimes they talk about a specific god but other times they are just talking about the idea of god,simple
one of the earliest western philosophers to write about god in a monotheistic way was the greek aristotle who describes god as the supreme cause,simple
aristotle saw god as a being that makes everything happen but is not influenced by anything else,simple
there are also some philosophical problems with god,simple
one of them is called god paradox,simple
it is a question about whether an omnipotent god can make a mountain that is so heavy he can not lift it,simple

in popular culture soul usually means deep feeling and commitment,simple
it is in this sense that the word appears in the term soul music,simple
however that music was also influenced by gospel music which was religious,simple
one popular idea about souls that is easy to express is that a person is a soul and has a body,simple
the soul is the i in i exist that feels and lives life,simple
what people call the mind could be part of the soul : one soul started this article other souls have edited it and another soul is reading it,simple
this view however implies that the human body is a possession and seems to devalue bodies that do not have souls as defined or understood by the speaker some people say that animals heretics and people of another religion do not have souls,simple
like most uses of the verb to be there is an ideology in these simple words,simple
christianity teaches that all humans have an immortal soul,simple
this means that it is a part of them which does not die when their physical body dies but lives on with them to heaven or to hell,simple
christians believe that the soul is the 'breath of life ' which god gave to adam,simple
in japan the soul is believed to weigh grams,simple
this belief may have been influenced by the observations of dr,simple
mcdougall in the early s,simple
one distinction often made is between soul which is distinct from other souls and spirit which may be combined with that of other beings,simple
the idea of the holy spirit in christianity for example is a universal and shared spirit many souls are part of and which is expressed on earth in that faith by the church meaning the body of christ meaning all bodies that follow jesus,simple
this could be more inclusive than the is/has view of souls and bodies,simple

the most important teachings of judaism is that there is one god who wants people to do what is just and compassionate,simple
judaism teaches that a person serves god by learning the holy books and doing what they teach,simple
these teachings include both ritual actions and ethics,simple
judaism teaches that all people are made in the image of god and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect,simple
the three main beliefs at the centre of judaism are monotheism identity and covenant,simple
these are some of judaism ’ s main teachings :,simple
the main teachings of judaism about god are that there is a god and there is only one god,simple
only god created the universe and only he controls it,simple
judaism also teaches that god is spiritual and not physical,simple
jews believe that god is one – a unity : he is one whole complete being,simple
he can not be divided into parts and people can not say how he looks in words they can only say how he is and what he does,simple
jews believe that all goodness and morality is from god,simple
god is interested in what people do and he watches what they do,simple
judaism teaches that all people are made in the image of god,simple
this is why people must be treated with dignity and respect,simple
a person serves god by being like god,simple
this means that they must do what is fair and just show mercy and behave with kindness and love for people,simple
judaism says that god exists forever that he is in every place and that he knows all things,simple
he is above nature “ supernatural ” but he is in the world and he hears people who pray to him and can answer them,simple
god is the main power in the universe,simple
judaism teaches that god allows people to choose what to do – this is called “ free will,simple
” a person is responsible for their actions,simple
god rewards people who do good actions and punishes people who do bad actions,simple
god gives a person a reward or a punishment in this world but he gives the final reward or punishment to the soul of the person after they die,simple
jews believe that god made an agreement called a “ covenant ” with abraham the ancestor of the jewish people,simple
the bible says that god promised to bless abraham and his descendants if they worshipped god and were faithful to him,simple
god made this covenant with abraham 's son isaac and with isaac 's son jacob,simple
god gave jacob another name – israel,simple
this is how jacob ’ s descendants got the name the “ children of israel ” or “ israelites,simple
” god later gave the torah to the israelites through their leader moses,simple
the torah told the israelites how to live and build their community,simple
god gave the israelites the ten commandments and other laws in the torah,simple
the jews are sometimes called the “ chosen people,simple
” this is because the bible says god told them “ you will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation ” exodus : and “ for you are a holy people to the lord your god and the lord chose you to be his own special nation out of all peoples on the earth ” deuteronomy :,simple
jews understand this means that they have special duties and responsibilities commanded by god,simple
for example jews must build a just society and serve only god,simple
jews believe that this covenant works in two ways : if they follow god ’ s laws he will give them his love and protection but they are also responsible for their sins – bad actions – and not doing what god told them,simple
jews believe that they must teach other people that god exists and that god wants all people to do good actions,simple
jews believe that their job in the world is to be a light to the nations isiah : by showing the people of the world ways to make the world a better place,simple
jews believe that god has given them a special job to repair the world,simple
their job is to make the world a better place with more good in it,simple
they must use the things in the world to increase good and come closer to god,simple
they call this “ tikkun olam ” – repairing the world,simple
jews see themselves as god ’ s partner to repair the world in any way they can – to find ways to lessen suffering of people and animals to make more peace and respect between people and protect the earth ’ s environment from destruction,simple
jews do not try to convince other people to believe in judaism,simple
jews believe they have a special job to show all peoples that god exists but people do not have to be jewish to follow god,simple
all people can serve god by following the seven commandments rules given to noah,simple
but judaism accepts people who choose to change their religion to judaism,simple
jews believe that god tells them in the torah the way of life that they must follow,simple
the torah says god wants the people of israel to walk in his ways to love him and to serve him and to keep god ’ s commandments deut,simple
: –,simple
actions are more important than beliefs and beliefs must be made into actions,simple
these actions are called “ mitzvot ” in hebrew singular : a mitzvah,simple
sometimes they are called “ laws ” rules or “ commandments ”,simple
many people think of a mitzvah as a good act or a good thing to do,simple
there are mitzvot in the torah,simple
jews believe that the torah gives mitzvot for all people all people must keep seven laws that were taught to noah and his children after the flood,simple
the jews must keep mitzvot which are listed in the torah,simple
the rabbis counted mitzvot that jews must not do negative mitzvot and mitzvot that jews must do positive mitzvot,simple
some mitzvot are for everyday life and some are only for special times such as jewish holidays,simple
many of the mitzvot are about the holy temple in jerusalem and can not be done now since the temple was destroyed,simple
some of the mitzvot are about how people must act to other people,simple
for example they must give charity to a poor person or help a person who is in danger,simple
they must not steal or lie,simple
these are ethical and moral mitzvot,simple
some mitzvot are about how people must act towards god,simple
for example they must respect god ’ s name or not work on the sabbath,simple
these are religious or ritual mitzvot,simple
jews believe that god tells them to do both ethical and religious acts,simple
jews see mitzvot as acts that sanctify – bring holiness – to the world and bring people and the world closer to god,simple
jews do the mitzvot to sanctify the physical world and the things in it such as food and drink clothing and natural activities such as sex work or seeing beautiful sights,simple
before doing many acts such as eating jews say a blessing – a short prayer – that god makes and gives a person the things that they need for life,simple
in judaism life is most holy and important,simple
a jew must stop doing other mitzvot of the torah to help save another person ’ s life,simple
jews believe that they must do the mitzvot with happiness and joy because the bible says “ serve god with joy come before god with singing ” psalms :,simple
doing a mitzvah helps a person come close to god and that makes the person happy,simple
a group of jews called the hasidim say this is the best way to live,simple
they say that worrying takes people away from joy and they will not see the beauty and good in the world,simple
many mitzvot in the torah are about the land of israel,simple
the talmud and later books call these mitzvot “ commandments connected to the land ” because jews can only do them in the land of israel,simple
for example jews give gifts to the poor or the priests from their fields every year take fruit or animals to the temple in jerusalem and must stop working on the land every seven years the “ shmittah ” – sabbatical year,simple
the land of israel is holy in judaism,simple
a jewish belief is that god created the earth from mount moriah in jerusalem in the land of israel and he is always closest to this land,simple
jews believe that this land is where god told the jewish people to build a society to serve him and many mitzvot commandments in the torah are about the land of israel,simple
the jewish people believe their history as a nation begins with abraham,simple
the story of abraham in the torah begins when god tells abraham to leave his country,simple
he promises abraham and his descendants a new home in the land of canaan,simple
this is now known as the land of israel,simple
it is named after abraham 's grandson jacob who was also called israel and who was the father of the twelve tribes,simple
this is where the name “ land of israel ” comes from,simple
the land is also called “ the promised land ” because in the torah god promises to give the land to the children of abraham gen : gen : gen : gen :,simple
the rabbis of the talmud understood from the torah num : that it is a “ mitzvah ” for jews to live in the land of israel,simple
they saw living outside of israel as not natural for a jew,simple
jews often called the land outside of israel galut,simple
this is usually translated as diaspora a place where people are scattered but the word more closely means exile,simple
the story of going out of egypt called the exodus is very important in the way the jewish people understand the world,simple
the torah tells how god took a group of slaves – the israelites – from slavery and tells them how to be his partner to build the world,simple
jews see this story as a model for the whole world,simple
in the future the whole world will change and all the people of the world will serve the one god,simple
this will be god ’ s kingdom on earth,simple
the whole of jewish history – and world history – is part of this process,simple
the prophets taught that god would send a person to the world who would help all the people of the world see that god is the maker and king of the world,simple
this person is called the messiah,simple
the word messiah comes from the hebrew word mashiah which means the anointed one,simple
the book of isaiah says the messiah will be a just king who will unite the jewish people and lead them in god 's way,simple
the messiah will also unite all the people of the world to serve god,simple
people will act with justice and kindness and the whole world will be filled with peace,simple
jews still wait for the messiah to come,simple
they believe that this will be a person,simple
other jews believe in a future time when justice and peace will come through the cooperation of all people and the help of god,simple
jews believe that to know what god wants them to do they must study the books of torah and its laws and do what they teach,simple
these include both laws about how to behave to other people and how to serve god,simple
the two most important groups of books in judaism are the bible and the talmud,simple
the beliefs and actions of judaism come from these books,simple
jewish teachers and scholars wrote more books called commentaries,simple
they explain and say more about what is written in the bible and talmud,simple
the torah is the most important of all jewish writings,simple
the first five books of the hebrew bible known to christians as the old testament make up the torah,simple
the torah contains the basic laws of judaism and describes the history of the jews until the death of moses,simple
jewish tradition says that god told moses what to write in the torah which is also called the five books of moses,simple
religious jews believe that moses brought the ten commandments and the torah down from mount sinai,simple
the ten commandments are special because they were heard by all of the jewish people at mount sinai,simple
however in traditional judaism all of the mitzvot in the torah are equally important,simple
jews divide the hebrew bible into three parts and call it the tanakh,simple
the three parts are the torah which is the first five books the nevi'im which are the books of the prophets and the ketuvim meaning the writings which are other books of history and moral teachings,simple
rabbinic jews also believe that there is another part of the torah besides the books of moses,simple
it is called the mishnah also called the oral torah or oral law,simple
it explains how to follow the laws written in the books,simple
there is a commentary explanation of the mishnah called the gemara,simple
together the mishna and the gemara make up the talmud,simple
karaite jews however believe that there is no additional torah besides the books of moses,simple
traditional jews believe that god gave the written torah and the oral torah to moses and that moses told it to the jewish people and that it is the same today as it was back then,simple
traditional jews also believe that all of the commandments must still be followed today,simple
liberal jews believe that the torah was inspired by god but written by human beings,simple
liberal jews believe that all of the ethical laws in the torah must still be followed but many ritual laws do not need to be followed today,simple
it is considered good in judaism to talk about the commandments and to try to understand how to follow them,simple
the talmud has many stories about rabbis who argued about the commandments,simple
over time some opinions have become the rule for everyone,simple
some rules are still being argued about,simple
jews praise logical argument and looking for truth,simple
there is no single leader of judaism who can decide how to follow the commandments or what to believe,simple
even though jews believe different things and they disagree about the rules they are still one religion and one people,simple
,simple
jews who follow the religious rules called kashrut only eat some types of food that are prepared by special rules,simple
food that a jew can eat is called kosher food,simple
traditional jews are very careful about kashrut,simple
they usually can not eat many foods in non-kosher restaurants or in the home of someone who does not keep kosher,simple
sometimes this makes it hard to visit people or to do business,simple
it is important to understand that this is part of their religion,simple
people help avoid this problem by choosing to dine with traditional jews in a kosher restaurant or serve them kosher food in their home,simple
liberal jews are not so careful about kosher although some of them may keep some rules,simple
jews can eat any fresh fruit or vegetables that do not have any insects on or in them,simple
jews can eat any fish that has scales and fins,simple
this includes fish like salmon and tuna,simple
they can not eat seafood like shrimp lobster or mussels,simple
jews can eat meat of any animal that chews its cud food which has already been partly digested and has split hooves,simple
for example cows sheep deer and goats,simple
however to be kosher it must be slaughtered and prepared in a specific way,simple
jews can eat many common birds such as chickens and turkeys and duck,simple
the birds must also be slaughtered and prepared in a specific way,simple
jews ca n't eat birds of prey like vultures,simple
foods sold in stores or restaurants must be checked by a jew who is an expert in kashrut,simple
the name for this person is mashgiach or kosher overseer,simple
he makes sure that the kosher rules were kept,simple
foods bought at the store often have a symbol called a hechsher on them to tell the customer that the food have been checked,simple
many everyday foods have a hechsher,simple
honey is an insect product made by bees but it is kosher,simple
it is a well-known myth that kosher food must be blessed by a rabbi,simple
some call non-kosher foods treifah meaning torn,simple
this is because the torah says not to eat an animal that has been killed or torn by another animal,simple
jews can not eat animals that do not have split hooves or animals that do not chew their cud,simple
unlike cows and sheep pigs have split hooves but do not chew their cud and are therefore not kosher,simple
jews can not eat rodents reptiles or amphibians,simple
jews can not eat any sea animal that does not have scales and fins,simple
for example sharks eels crabs shrimp and lobsters are not kosher,simple
jews can not eat birds that eat meat like vultures which are mentioned in a list in the torah,simple
jews can not eat any insects except for a few types of crickets or locusts,simple
there are other rules for kosher food as well,simple
animals must be killed in a certain way including using a fast strike across the neck with a very sharp blade which makes sure that the animal dies quickly,simple
all the blood must be removed from an animal before the meat is eaten,simple
this is done by soaking and salting the meat,simple
a jew can not eat a meal that has both meat and milk in it,simple
this comes from the rule in the torah that a jew must not cook a young goat in its mother 's milk,simple
because of this jews use separate dishes and utensils for foods that have meat in it and foods that have milk in it,simple
after eating meat many jews do not drink milk products before a time period between to hours has passed,simple
kosher food must be cooked in a kitchen for actual kosher food,simple
if the kitchen has been used to cook non-kosher food such as rabbit and pig then the kitchen must be cleaned in a special way before it can be used to cook kosher food,simple

one of the commandments is to keep the jewish sabbath or shabbat,simple
shabbat starts every friday at sunset and ends on saturday at nightfall,simple
shabbat is a day of rest to thank god for making the universe,simple
the tradition of resting on shabbat comes from the torah,simple
according to the torah god created the world in six days and on the seventh day shabbat he rested,simple
many jews go to their temple or synagogue to pray on shabbat,simple
religious jews follow special rules on shabbat,simple
these rules require jews not to do creative work on shabbat,simple
one reason for this is to give people a break from all the things that make them busy during the week,simple
this helps them focus more on appreciating god their family and the rest of creation,simple
also it reminds people that god is the creator and ruler of the world and no matter how great a person 's creative power is it can not compare with god 's creation of the universe and everything in it,simple
many of these categories of creative work include actions that people might not think of as work,simple
for instance on shabbat a jew can not : use electrical machines like phones computers or a tv buy or sell things put on or off a fire or a light drive a car or ride a bicycle cook write build or fix thingstraditional jews are very careful about shabbat,simple
it is a special day,simple
they clean their houses and prepare special food for shabbat,simple
they dress in their nicest clothes,simple
they sing beautiful songs and say extra prayers in the synagogue,simple
they have dinner and lunch with their families,simple
many families also invite guests for dinner and for lunch,simple
they eat special delicious food and sing together traditional shabbat songs,simple
on shabbat afternoon people study judaism together or just visit friends,simple
liberal jews do not follow those rules,simple
some do go to synagogue visit friends or have special meals,simple
but they may also talk on the phone drive cars and go shopping,simple
birth brit mila for boys a circumcision ceremony when a boy is days old,simple
it includes naming the baby,simple
some non-orthodox jews practice brit shalom a baby naming ceremony for jewish boys without circumcision,simple
pidyon haben for boys is when a father does a special ceremony to redeem his wife 's first son from the temple as originally all firstborn boys were sent to serve in the temple,simple
levites a tribe of israel and cohanim priests do not do this ritual,simple
bat mitzvah for girls a 'coming of age ' ceremony when a girl turns for some jews,simple
bat mitzvah means daughter of the mitvah or daughter of the commandments in hebrew,simple
once a girl turns or she is considered a woman and is expected to follow jewish law,simple
a ceremony is not required,simple
bat mitzvah not only refers to the ceremony but also to the girl herself,simple
bar mitzvah for boys a 'coming of age ' ceremony when a boy turns,simple
it includes reading the torah and special prayers,simple
bar mitzvah means son of the mitzvah or son of the commandments in hebrew,simple
once a boy turns he is considered a man and is expected to follow jewish law,simple
a ceremony is not required,simple
bar mitzvah not only refers to the ceremony but also to the boy himself,simple
marriage having children death,simple
for a very long time most jews in europe believed the same basic things about judaism,simple
jews in other lands had different beliefs and customs than european jews,simple
about years ago a small group of jews in germany decided to stop believing in many parts of judaism and try to become more modern and more like germans,simple
those jews were called reform jews,simple
today there are three main kinds of judaism : reform conservative and orthodox judaism,simple
there are also kinds with a smaller number of people such as reconstructionist judaism and karaite judaism,simple
each group has its own practices according to how it understands the jewish laws,simple
some do not believe in keeping most of the laws,simple
for example : reform also called liberal or progressive judaism does not require eating kosher food or keeping the sabbath at all,simple
reform judaism teaches jews to focus on the ethical laws of judaism,simple
conservative judaism developed after reform judaism,simple
the leaders of conservative judaism felt that reform judaism was too radical,simple
they wanted to conserve protect jewish tradition instead of reforming changing it,simple
orthodox jews do not believe that reform or conservative judaism are correct because they believe that the laws given by god are timeless and ca n't be changed,simple
in the most recent survey of jews in the united states in - it was found that of american jews say they are reform say they are conservative say they are orthodox say they are reconstructionist and do not say what type they are,simple
in israel almost all jews go to orthodox synagogues,simple
there are very few reform or conservative synagogues but there has been an steady increase since,simple
in israel jews do not call themselves reform conservative or orthodox,simple
instead they mostly call themselves haredi completely religious dati basically religious masorati traditional/conservative or chiloni secular,simple
surveys suggest about of israelis say they are secular say they are dati or haredi and say they are traditional,simple
names are very important in judaism,simple
many jews believe that a name not only tells you who someone is but also tells you something about them,simple
names of god are very special in judaism so jews do not write them or speak them fully but use other words instead,simple
that is why some jews write g-d with a - instead of an o,simple
hashem means the name,simple
it is the word jews use most often when not praying to talk about god,simple
adonai means my lord,simple
this name tells jews about god 's position,simple
god is the king of the world and his name adonai lets us know that,simple
elohim means one who is strong enough to do everything,simple
this name is used when talking about god 's power to create or god 's justice,simple
this tells us that god is the creator and that god rules the world with just laws,simple
the two names above are so special that orthodox jews use these names only when they pray and read the torah,simple
when they are not praying or reading the torah they say hashem the name or elokim,simple
god - some jews write god by replacing the o with a dash like this : g-d,simple
they do this because god 's name is very holy so they are not allowed to throw away a piece of paper with god written on it,simple
however if by accident god is written then the paper can be disposed of in a special way and buried in a special place,simple
others say that god is just an english word not hebrew and so it is not holy,simple
yhwh yehovah/yahweh is the most sacred name of god in hebrew and is not pronounced by most jews,simple
no one knows where the name came from or what exactly it means,simple
it looks like the hebrew word hayah which is the verb to be,simple
according to hebrew scripture when moses asked god who god was god told moses i am that i am/i am who i am,simple
jews believe that the name yhwh shows that god is endless,simple
instead of trying to say it most jews say hashem which means the name,simple
some people pronounce this name as yahweh or jehovah,simple
scholars of religion sometimes refer to yhwh as the tetragrammaton from greek words meaning four letters,simple
three types of family are : nuclear family single-parent family and extended family,simple
a nuclear family is made up of parents and one or more children living together,simple
a single-parent family is one where there is one parent and one or more children,simple
an extended family or joint families means father mother daughters sons grandparents uncles aunts cousins nieces and nephews,simple
in many countries including china pakistan and india extended or joint families traditionally live together,simple
both the nuclear family and the single-parent family are also called the immediate family,simple
foster families are families where a child lives with and is cared for by people who are not his or her parents,simple
some family members are genetically closer to each other,simple
the following table gives examples : notes :,simple
divorce orphan,simple
the government tries to lead the whole group,simple
governments do things such as : decide which people get which pieces of land decide which people can tell other people what to do decide whether to go to war with another country create money build things for the use of the whole group such as roads hospitals libraries and docks,simple
educate people either for their own good or to teach them what the government wants them to know take care of the very young the sick or the very old manage the welfare of the country and manages the money available for spending on services hospitals schools etc,simple
one of the ways the government leads the group is by making laws and rules which tell everybody what they can and can not do,simple
the government makes these laws so that society will be safe and well-ordered,simple
the law that you must not drink alcohol while driving a car stops people from drunk driving which could kill people,simple
the law you must wear a helmet on a motorcycle makes sure that people protect themselves the government can also control people and what happens in a country in other ways besides making laws,simple
for example how the government spends its money makes a big difference in what people will do or what will happen to people,simple
if the government spends a lot of money on hospitals and nurses the people will probably become healthier,simple
also if people like their government or think that their government is wise they may do something just because their government says it is a good thing to do,simple
governments often make posters or television advertisements that encourage people to stop smoking cigarettes or eat more fruits and vegetables,simple
politics is often compared to ethics ideas about right and wrong,simple
ethics is a more abstract study of right and wrong,simple
ethics is usually more concerned with principle than law or politics or diplomacy so many people think ethics is not practical,simple
but without some agreement on ethics there is probably no way to even have a debate laws or an election,simple
there is always some agreement on ethics and personal conduct in a political system,simple
in most countries people have formed political parties to put forward their ideas,simple
there is usually some disagreement between people within a party but they work together because they feel that they agree on enough things and they will have more power if they join together,simple
they agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders,simple
an election is usually a competition between different parties,simple
some examples of parties are the liberal party the labor party and the greens,simple
the greek philosopher aristotle wrote that humans are a political animal and that ethics and politics are closely linked,simple
niccolò machiavelli wrote in his book the prince that politics was firstly about having and keeping power,simple
he said that without power a leader could do nothing,simple
in thomas hobbes wrote leviathan a book about politics,simple
hobbes wrote that people living in groups often give up some of their rights in exchange for some protections from a government,simple
in the s john stuart mill developed the liberal idea of politics,simple
mill said that democracy is the most important political development of the s,simple
he said that there should be more protection for individual rights against the government,simple
bernard crick wrote a list of the political virtues which were about best practices of politics itself,simple
there are also disagreements between different countries,simple
attempts to solve the problem with meetings are called diplomacy,simple
this is politics between nations instead of politics within nations,simple
if the problems are not resolved by diplomatic meetings they can lead to war or terrorism,simple
political economy constitution geopolitics,simple
the idea of bartering things is very old,simple
a long time ago people did not buy or sell with money,simple
instead they traded one thing for another to get what they wanted or needed,simple
one person who owned many cows could trade with another person who owned much wheat,simple
each would trade a little of what he had with the other,simple
this would support the people on his farm,simple
other things that were easier to carry around than cows also came to be held as valuable,simple
this gave rise to trade items such as jewelry and spices,simple
when people changed from trading in things like for example cows and wheat to using money instead they needed things that would last a long time,simple
they must still have a known value and could be carried around,simple
the first country in the world to make metal coins was called lydia,simple
these first appeared during the th century bc in the western part of what is now turkey,simple
the lydian coins were made of a weighed amount of precious metal and were stamped with a picture of a lion,simple
this idea soon spread to greece the rest of the mediterranean and the rest of the world,simple
coins were all made to the same size and shape,simple
in some parts of the world different things have been used as money like clam shells or blocks of salt,simple
besides being easier to carry than cows using money had many other advantages,simple
money is easier to divide than many trade goods,simple
if someone own cows and wants to trade for only half a cow 's worth of wheat he probably does not want to cut his cow in half,simple
but if he sells his cow for money and buys wheat with money he can get exactly the amount he wants,simple
cows die and wheat rots,simple
but money lasts longer than most trade goods,simple
if someone sells a cow for money he can save that money away until he needs it,simple
he can always leave it to his children when he dies,simple
it can last a very long time and he can use it at any time,simple
not every cow is as good as another cow,simple
some cows are sick and old and others are healthy and young,simple
some wheat is good and other wheat is moldy or stale,simple
so if a person trades cows for wheat he might have a hard time arguing over how much wheat each cow is worth,simple
however money is standard,simple
that means one dollar is worth the same as another dollar,simple
it is easier to add up and count money than to add up the value of different cows or amounts of wheat,simple
later after coins had been used for hundreds of years paper money started out as a promise to pay in coin much like an i,simple
o,simple
u,simple
note,simple
the first true paper money was used in china in the th century ad,simple
paper money was also printed in sweden between and,simple
both times it did not work well and had to be stopped because the banks kept running out of coins to pay on the notes,simple
massachusetts bay colony printed paper money in the s,simple
this time the use became more common,simple
today most of what people think of as money is not even things you can hold,simple
it is numbers in bank accounts saved in computer memories,simple
many people still feel more comfortable using coins and paper and do not totally trust using electronic money on a computer memory,simple
many types of money have been used at different times in history,simple
these are : cowry shells commodity money convertible paper money inconvertible money bank deposits electronic moneycommodity money can be used for other purposes besides serving as a medium of exchange,simple
we say it possesses intrinsic value because it is useful or valuable by itself,simple
some examples of commodity money are cattle silk gold and silver,simple
convertible paper money is money that is convertible into gold and silver,simple
gold and silver certificates are convertible paper money as they can be fully convertible into gold and silver,simple
inconvertible money is money that can not be converted into gold and silver,simple
notes and coins are inconvertible money,simple
they are inconvertible and are declared by the government money,simple
such fiat money is a country 's legal tender,simple
today notes and coins are the currencies used in bank deposits,simple
types of bank deposits : demand deposits savings deposits time deposits negotiable certificate,simple

according to the geneva conventions there are five goals for international red cross and red crescent movements to monitor compliance of warring parties with the geneva conventions to organize nursing and care for those who are wounded on the battlefield to supervise the treatment of prisoners of war and treat them to help with the search for missing persons in a war tracing service to organize protection and care for normal people to make peace between groups in war,simple
after world war i the nations of the world formed the league of nations,simple
this organization was a place where nations could talk through their differences calmly,simple
however some countries like germany italy and japan ignored the league and tried to solve their problems through war,simple
members of the league of nations did not want to go to war to protect other members and the league failed,simple
a second world war soon followed,simple
the allies of world war ii often called themselves the united nations united against the axis powers,simple
after the war the winners formed a new organization for world peace,simple
on th april in san francisco they decided on the name 'united nations,simple
in june they signed the united nations charter saying how the organization would work,simple
the un was created on october and its first meeting was held in january,simple
since the th of october has been called “ united nations day ”,simple
all organs of the united nations are based in new york city except the international court of justice which is located at the hague in the netherlands,simple
the main building for the united nations is in new york city in the united states of america but the un also has important offices in geneva switzerland nairobi kenya and vienna austria,simple
the un tries to be peaceful but sometimes when talks do not work the un unlike the league of nations will fight too,simple
in the s the un helped south korea in a war against north korea and in the s the un helped to force iraqi soldiers out of kuwait,simple
at other times the un has formed 'peacekeeping ' forces,simple
un peacekeepers travel to troubled places in the world and try - sometimes successfully sometimes not - to keep the peace,simple
today there are un peacekeepers working in afghanistan cyprus haiti liberia and several other countries,simple
through a series of goals resolutions and declarations adopted by member nations of the united nations the world has a set of commitments actions and goals to stop and reverse the spread of hiv and scale up towards universal access to hiv prevention treatment care and support services,simple
the united nations has six principal organs : additionally there are so-called special agencies of the united nations,simple
some are older than the united nations,simple
here are a few of them : the united nations children 's fund unicef the world health organization who the food and agriculture organization fao the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco the international labour organization ilo the international monetary fund imf the united nations environment programme unep the united nations development programme undp,simple
members of the united nations,simple
in most countries of the world young men and in a few countries women between and and of good health may be forced by the government of their country to join the military and have military training,simple
this is called conscription,simple
the countries that do not have conscription include australia bangladesh canada france hungary india italy japan malta new zealand saudi arabia slovenia south africa spain and the united kingdom,simple
in some countries such as argentina and united states conscription is legal but is not used at the present time,simple
when a person wants to join the military as a volunteer they enlist,simple
this means simply that they put their name on a list,simple
they have to be above a certain age or in most countries,simple
they have to pass physical fitness tests to show that they are well enough to do the jobs that they will have to do,simple
they must also have good enough hearing to hear orders and good enough sight to use a rifle,simple
new people in the military are often called “ recruits ”,simple
they have training at a special camp sometimes called “ boot camp or basic training,simple
during this training the recruits usually have very little free time,simple
they learn to understand the orders or commands that are given by the officers to the troops,simple
the troops are the military people in a group,simple
they learn the right ways to obey the orders,simple
they do a lot of exercise to improve their fitness and strength,simple
they learn about weapons first aid and their uniforms and kit,simple
their kit is their equipment,simple
recruits also learn how to march,simple
this is the way to walk together keeping in step,simple
learning to march is sometimes called “ drill ”,simple
by the time soldiers finish boot camp they should know enough to be a helpful person in their group,simple
the camp usually finishes with a parade in which the newly trained recruits show off their marching and other skills they have learned in front of important visitors,simple
once the recruits are fully trained they are ready to defend protect their country from attack or to go to war if necessary,simple
from the earliest times individual states or political factions have used war to gain sovereignty over regions,simple
in one of the earliest civilizations in history mesopotamia they were in a near constant state of war,simple
ancient egypt during its early dynastic period came about by war when lower and upper egypt were joined together as one country about bc,simple
the zhou dynasty ruled ancient china came to power in through war,simple
scipio africanus - bce defeated carthage leading ancient rome to begin a conquest of the known world,simple
philip ii of macedon - bce united a group of city-states to become ancient greece,simple
sometimes people do n't see a difference between fighting between countries or people and the formal declaration of a state of war,simple
those who do see this difference usually only use the word war for the fighting where the countries ' governments have officially declared war on each other,simple
smaller armed conflicts are often called riots rebellions coups etc,simple
one country may send forces to another country for a variety of reasons,simple
sometimes it is to help keep order or prevent killings of innocents or other crimes against humanity,simple
it may be to protect a friendly government against an uprising,simple
here it may be called a police action or humanitarian intervention instead of a war,simple
some people think it 's still a war,simple
another kind of war existed from until called the cold war,simple
this started when diplomatic relations between the united states and the soviet union broke down,simple
both countries had nuclear weapons and both stood ready to use them against the other,simple
but there was no actual war between the two,simple
it ended with the fall of the soviet union in,simple
the cold war was also called a containment where the united states tried to prevent the spread of communism to other countries,simple
during the cold war the major powers did not fight themselves but often backed third parties in what was called a proxy war,simple
the vietnam war is often given as an example of a proxy war,simple
but proxy wars happened long before the cold war and are still happening,simple
a war between peoples and groups in the same country is known as a civil war,simple
it is generally agreed there are two things that make a war a civil war,simple
it must be a struggle between groups in the same country or state over political control or to force a major change in the government 's policy,simple
the second criterion is that more than people have to have been killed with a minimum of from each side,simple
the american civil war is an example of a civil war,simple
while the figures are mere estimates the total casualties are thought to be about,simple
only in the last years or so have states agreed on international laws to limit warfare,simple
this has been mainly for humanitarian reasons,simple
the geneva conventions and the hague conventions are two examples of agreements that establish laws governing wars,simple
collectively these are usually called international humanitarian law ihl,simple
because these are established laws they restrict those engaged in armed conflicts to follow the ihl,simple
also a country must not only respect the law but they also need to make sure other countries respect it as well,simple
they can not turn a blind eye meaning pretend they do not see a thing to countries who are not following ihc,simple
the first of these was the geneva convention in,simple
it became international law with the signatures of countries,simple
the statistical analysis of war was started by lewis fry richardson following world war i,simple
more recent databases of wars have been assembled by the correlates of war project and peter brecke,simple

there are two schools of thought : partial writing : writing is any system of graphic symbols which conveys some thought,simple
full writing : writing is any graphic system which can convey any and all thought,simple
ptherefore depending on an author 's definition of writing the term may be used in different ways,simple
with many early systems we do not know what they do convey,simple
the central idea is that a full writing system must be able to represent anything that might be said in spoken language,simple
p from this point of view the invention of the rebus is an essential step,simple
we can only be sure a sign system is full writing if we can translate the symbols into a modern language,simple
in the case of some ancient scripts we can not do this,simple
writing was invented independently a number of times,simple
the sumerian the ancient egyptian the chinese and the mayan writings are separate in their invention,simple
p all these writing systems started with pictographs symbols that stood for things,simple
then they developed a mixture of methods,simple
our own alphabetic system is different,simple
it is based on the sounds of spoken language,simple
all alphabets are modified versions of the first one which originated with the phoenicians and the ancient greeks,simple
the sumerians lived in mesopotamia between the tigris and euphrates rivers,simple
years ago this was a fertile region and is now mostly in iraq,simple
the sumerians developed a form of writing called cuneiform,simple
triangular marks were pressed into soft clay tablets,simple
after the clay had dried in the sun the tablets were baked,simple
then they were carried somewhere else for others to read,simple
we know that its first uses were for trade accounting and administration,simple
the earliest signs were mostly pictorial but soon they stood as symbols for objects ideas and sounds,simple
this writing system was extremely successful and outlasted the sumerian empire,simple
it was then used by other civilisations in the middle east such as the old akkadian babylonian assyrian elamite hittite old persian and ugaritic empires,simple
the last cuneiform inscription was dated as ad,simple
thus the system had lasted for more than years,simple
p each version of cuneiform had to be deciphered separately because all the languages were different,simple
documents including stone objects written in more than one language provided the clues,simple
this is the most famous of the old forms of writing or scripts,simple
it was invented at roughly the same time as cuneiform yet was quite different in style and used different materials,simple
egyptians ended up with three writing systems for the same language,simple
they were :,simple
hieroglyphic : the famous pictorial language on stone monuments,simple
,simple
hieratic : a cursive 'running ' script used by the priests,simple
,simple
demotic : a cursive script used by the people,simple
the writing tools used varied according to the material which was written on,simple
the two cursive scripts were written with reed pens and carbon inks onto papyrus,simple
if the material was cloth then the writing was done by a brush,simple
many examples survive,simple
the hieroglyphs were inscribed carved into stone hammer chisel or painted onto stone surfaces,simple
many survive some with the original colours intact,simple
the key event in the decipherment of hieroglyphic writing was the discovery of the rosetta stone,simple
this is a granite slab with the same message written in hieroglyphic demotic and in greek,simple
ancient greek is well understood and made possible the interpretation of the other two scripts,simple
chinese is the language with the largest number of native speakers,simple
its history dates back to about bc,simple
p the chinese writing system is idio-syllabic a mixed method using characters which may have one or more of these elements :,simple
pictographic : representing objects,simple
,simple
visual logic : the number '' is three horizontal strokes,simple
,simple
complex logic : the sun is a box with a horizontal mid-stroke,simple
,simple
rebus : sounds like,simple
the character for wheat is also used for 'come ' because the words are homophonous sound alike,simple
,simple
semantic-phonetic : combination of a character for meaning with another for sound pronunciation,simple
chinese has a huge number of characters : in the region of,simple
p because of this printing methods were never really successful in china despite their early invention,simple
in the th century wang tzhen had sixty thousand wood block characters cut a huge investment in time and money,simple
he printed copies of a local gazette and was author of a treatise on agriculture and other technical works,simple
even with printing machines from europe in the th century the process was hampered by the huge number of characters which slowed the composition to a snail 's pace,simple
china has eight regional languages that are mutually unintelligible and many true dialects,simple
the system appears to work mainly because as many as speak mandarin,simple
fluency in chinese reading and writing is undoubtedly difficult to achieve and this must act as a brake on the drive for literacy,simple
there have been a number of attempts to reform or simplify the system,simple
the most radical in pinyin which is a program to replace chinese characters with an alphabetic system,simple
this was supported by mao but faltered after his death,simple
it seems that the idea of an alphabet–a script based entirely upon sound–arose only once and has been copied and adapted to suit many different languages,simple
although no alphabet fits its language perfectly it is flexible enough to fit any language approximately,simple
it was a unique invention,simple
pour alphabet is called the roman alphabet as compared with the cyrillic and other alphabets,simple
all of these come from the ancient greek alphabet which dates back to about to bc,simple
p the greek alphabet was probably developed from the phoenician script which appeared somewhat earlier and had some similar letter-shapes,simple
the phoenician language was a semitic language often called canaanite,simple
the semitic group of languages includes arabic maltese hebrew and also aramaic the language spoken by jesus,simple
we do not know much about how the alphabetic idea arose but the phoenicians a trading people came up with letters which were adapted by the early greeks to produce their alphabet,simple
the one big difference is that the phoenician script had no pure vowels,simple
arabic script has vowels which may be shown by diacritics small marks above or below the line,simple
the oldest qu'ran manuscripts had no diacritics,simple
israeli children today use texts with vowel 'dots ' added to about the third grade,simple
pno ancient script alphabetic or not had pure vowels before the greeks,simple
the greek alphabet even has two vowels for 'e ' and two for 'o ' to distinguish between the long and short sounds,simple
it is fairly clear from this that careful thought went into both the phoenician invention and the greek adaptation,simple
however no details survive of either process,simple
semitic scripts apparently derive from proto-sinaitic a script of which only inscriptions plus doubtful are known,simple
it is thought by some researchers that the original source of this script was the egyptian hieratic script,simple
by the late middle kingdom about bc hieratic had added some alphabetic signs for representing the consonants of foreign names,simple
egyptian activity in sinai was at its height at that time,simple
a similar idea had been suggested many years before,simple
there are a number of scripts which have never been deciphered despite much effort,simple
p perhaps the most famous are the script of the indus valley civilization and etruscan,simple
the indus river civilisation predates other literate civilisations on the indian subcontinent going back to about bc,simple
their cities of mohenjo-daru and harappa were well-planned with good drainage,simple
the script is found on seal stones terracotta bronze bone and ivory,simple
all are brief and the language is unknown,simple
the etruscan language used greek letter-forms and is found mainly on etruscan tombs from tuscany through to venice,simple
they were an empire before the romans who defeated them and absorbed their ideas,simple
all knowledge of their language was lost except that some of the names on tomb memorials can be read from the greek letters,simple
the tărtăria tablets are three tablets discovered in in the village of tărtăria hungarian : alsótatárlaka,simple
this is about km mi from alba iulia in romania,simple
the tablets dated to around bc have symbols in clay : the vinča symbols,simple
some claim they are a yet undeciphered language,simple
if this is so they would be the earliest known form of writing,simple
in similar symbols were found during excavations by miloje vasić – in vinča,simple
this is a suburb of belgrade serbia some km from turdaș,simple
later more were found in another part of belgrade,simple
since over one hundred and fifty vinča sites have been found in serbia alone,simple
many including vinča itself have not been fully excavated,simple
the culture of the whole area is called the vinča culture,simple
although some of these symbols look exactly the same as some letters in etruscan greek and aramaic they are generally regarded as an original independent development,simple
it is only in the last years that most people have been able to read and write in europe and north america,simple
in many other parts of the world this did not happen until the th century,simple
until then literacy was mainly for clerics that is people who had training as priests,simple
even wealthy people were often illiterate and used scribes to write for them,simple
the invention of printing came before mass literacy,simple
before each book had to be created by hand so there were few books available compared to the billions in the world today,simple
mass literacy needed cheap books,simple
even now there is still widespread illiteracy,simple
the ordinary use of writing by means of a pen and paper,simple
can refer to writing for oneself as in a diary but mostly it refers to sending letters,simple
once it was almost the only means of communication between people who were separated,simple
now the telephone and e-mail are the most common means of distance communication,simple

english literature branko mikasinovich enid blyton,simple
early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars,simple
they made maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and calendars to work out the time of year,simple
early civilisations such as the maya people and the ancient egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions,simple
they also began to think about the place of earth in the universe,simple
for a long time people thought earth was the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun went around it,simple
this is known as geocentrism,simple
ancient greeks tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements,simple
a mathematician named eratosthenes was the first who measured the size of the earth and proved that the earth is a sphere,simple
a theory by another mathematician named aristarchus was that the sun is in the center and the earth is moving around it,simple
this is known as heliocentrism,simple
only a few people thought it was right,simple
the rest continued to believe in the geocentric model,simple
most of the names of constellations and stars come from greeks of that time,simple
arabic astronomers made many advancements during the middle ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the earth,simple
they also learned from the ancients by translating greek books into arabic,simple
during the renaissance a priest named nicolaus copernicus thought from looking at the way the planets moved that the earth was not the center of everything,simple
based on previous works he said that the earth was a planet and all the planets moved around the sun,simple
this brought back the old idea of heliocentrism,simple
a physicist called galileo galilei built his own telescopes and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time,simple
he agreed with copernicus,simple
the catholic church decided that galileo was wrong,simple
he had to spend the rest of his life under house arrest,simple
heliocentric ideas were soon improved by johannes kepler and isaac newton who invented the theory of gravity,simple
after galileo people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets uranus and neptune,simple
they also saw how stars were similar to our sun but in a range of colours and sizes,simple
they also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae,simple
the th century saw important changes in astronomy,simple
in karl jansky discovered radio emission from outside the earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky,simple
those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy allowing more discoveries to be made,simple
the opening of this new window on the universe saw the discovery of entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space,simple
the waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source,simple
the period after world war saw more observatories where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites normally by governments,simple
for example bernard lovell began radio astronomy at jodrell bank using leftover military radar equipment,simple
by the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world,simple
similarly the end of the s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at mauna kea in hawaii a good site for visible and infra-red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies,simple
the next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry,simple
this allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites,simple
space telescopes gave access for the first time in history to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere,simple
the x-rays gamma rays ultraviolet light and parts of the infra-red spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched,simple
as with other parts of the spectrum new discoveries were made,simple
from s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,simple
discoveries broadly come in two types : bodies and phenomena,simple
bodies are things in the universe whether it is a planet like our earth or a galaxy like our milky way,simple
phenomena are events and happenings in the universe,simple
for convenience this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found : those found around stars are solar bodies those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies,simple
planets asteroids comets,simple
starsdiffuse objects : nebulas clusterscompact stars : white dwarves neutron stars black holes,simple
galaxies galaxy clusters superclusters,simple
burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly,simple
these are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a burst of energy,simple
they include : supernovas novasperiodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way,simple
the name periodic comes from period which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle,simple
periodic phenomena include : pulsars variable starsnoise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago,simple
the signal from these events bounce around the universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity,simple
in this way it resembles noise the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy,simple
the most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions,simple
the principal astronomical example is : cosmic background radiation,simple
,simple
telescopes are the main tool of observing,simple
they take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area,simple
this is like making your eyes very big and powerful,simple
astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim,simple
telescopes make objects look bigger closer brighter,simple
spectrometers study the different wavelengths of light,simple
this shows what something is made of,simple
many telescopes are in satellites,simple
they are space observatories,simple
there are way astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens,simple
light from a distant source reaches a sensor and gets measured normally by a human eye or a camera,simple
for very dim sources there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen,simple
one technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration which is like longer exposures in photography,simple
astronomical sources do not move much : only the rotation and movement of the earth causes them to move across the heavens,simple
as light particles reach the camera over time they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible than the background until it can be seen,simple
telescopes at most observatories and satellite instruments can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures,simple
also images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours days or even months,simple
in the digital era digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer which overlays the images after correcting for movement,simple
with radio telescopes smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a big one which works like one as big as the distance between the two smaller telescopes,simple
adaptive optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something to see it better,simple
data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it,simple
the observation is first stored as data,simple
this data will then have various techniques used to analyse it,simple
fourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation over a length of time is changing periodically changes like a wave,simple
if so it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern and find many things including new planets,simple
a good example of a fields comes from pulsars which pulse regularly in radio waves,simple
these turned out to be similar to some but not all of a type of bright source in x-rays called a low-mass x-ray binary,simple
it turned out that all pulsars and some lmxbs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found,simple
those lmxbs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes,simple
this section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy their period of importance and the terms used to describe them,simple
it should be noted that astronomy in the modern era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum although there is some evidence this is changing,simple
,simple
solar astronomy is the study of the sun,simple
the sun is the closest star to earth at around million miles away,simple
it is the easiest to observe in detail,simple
observing the sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed,simple
changes in the sun can affect the weather and climate on earth,simple
a stream of charged particles called the solar wind is constantly sent off from the sun,simple
the solar wind hitting the earth 's magnetic field causes the northern lights,simple
studying the sun helped people understand how nuclear fusion works,simple
planetary astronomy is the study of planets moons dwarf planets comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars,simple
the planets of our own solar system have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as cassini-huygens saturn and the voyager and,simple
galactic astronomy is the study of distant galaxies,simple
studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe,simple
galactic astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of telescopes and computer simulations,simple
,simple
radio telescope,simple
hydrodynamics is used in astronomy for mathematically modelling how gases behave,simple
strong magnetic fields found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars,simple
this makes mhd an important and useful tool in astronomy,simple
,simple
gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the universe in the gravitational wave spectrum,simple
so far all astronomy that has been done has used the electromagnetic spectrum,simple
gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime emitted by very dense objects changing shape which include white dwarves neutron stars and black holes,simple
because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly the impact of gravitational wave astronomy has been very limited,simple
,simple
a good example of a fields comes from pulsars which pulse regularly in radio waves,simple
these turned out to be similar to some but not all of a type of bright source in x-rays called a low-mass x-ray binary,simple
it turned out that all pulsars and some lmxbs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found,simple

==== solar astronomy ====,simple
there are galaxies of different sizes,simple
typical galaxies range from dwarfs with as few as ten million stars up to giants with a hundred trillion stars all orbiting the galaxy 's center of mass,simple
galaxies may contain many multiple star systems star clusters and various interstellar clouds,simple
the sun is one of the stars in the milky way galaxy the solar system includes the earth and all the other objects that orbit the sun,simple
star clusters are not galaxies they are inside galaxies,simple
globular clusters are spherical-shape star cluster which are part of the outer halo of the milky way,simple
one of the largest and oldest known star clusters messier has several million stars packed closely together with a black hole at its centre,simple
the stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies,simple
within galaxy clusters galaxies move relative to other galaxies,simple
they can and do collide,simple
when this happens the stars generally move past each other but gas clouds and dust interact and can form a burst of new stars,simple
gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes forming bars rings or tail-like structures,simple
many galaxies also continue to form new generations of stars,simple
the milky way and all spiral shaped galaxies like it see right side image of ngc produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year,simple
this star formation happens in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about to of the mass of these galaxies,simple
globular star clusters on the other hand are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up,simple
in the astronomical literature the word 'galaxy ' with a capital g is used for our galaxy the milky way,simple
the billions of other galaxies are just written as 'galaxy ' with a lowercase g,simple
the term milky way first came out in the english language in a poem by chaucer,simple
see yonder lo the galaxyë which men clepeth the milky wey for hit is whyt,simple
when william herschel wrote his catalogue of deep sky objects he used the name spiral nebula for objects like the andromeda galaxy,simple
years later astronomers discovered that they are made of stars as the milky way is so nebula is now only used for diffuse structures within a galaxy,simple
there are two main kinds of galaxies spiral galaxy and elliptical galaxy,simple
they are classified according to the hubble sequence,simple
a spiral galaxy is a galaxy that has a spiral shape,simple
most of the galaxies in the universe observed by astronomers are spiral galaxies about,simple
they are divided into two : barred spiral galaxy classified as sb unbarred spiral galaxy classified as sangc and ngc are examples of barred spiral galaxy,simple
whirlpool galaxy and messier are examples of unbarred spiral galaxy,simple
the identifying characteristics of a spiral galaxy are disk-shaped rotating spiral arms and a bulge in the galactic core,simple
the spiral arms are where new hot stars are born,simple
bulge in the galactic core has old stars,simple
this feature is common to the most spiral galaxies,simple
an elliptical galaxy is a galaxy that has a ellipsoid d of ellipse shape,simple
this type of galaxy are dominant in universe especially in galaxy clusters,simple
the shape range from circle ellipse and cigar-shaped,simple
in hubble sequence this shape can be represented as class : e circle-shape e ellipse-shape e cigar-shapedelliptical galaxy can have a large range size,simple
the giant elliptical galaxy can be over a more million light year and the smallest know as dwarf elliptical galaxy are less than one-tenth the size of milky way the size of an elliptical galaxy can be measured as an effective radius which defines the area from which half its light comes,simple
the mass of elliptical galaxy is also large,simple
a giant elliptical galaxy can have mass of many trillions of solar masses,simple
the simple definition of lenticular galaxy is a galaxy seen in a disc shape,simple
determining the shape of a lenticular galaxy is difficult because the shape can be between spiral galaxy and elliptical galaxy,simple
the shape can be known by looking at the bulge of the galactic center,simple
if the bulge is very bright it is a spiral galaxy,simple
list of galaxies list of nearest galaxies most distant things local group ic : the largest known galaxy with about trillion stars,simple
the moon being round half of it is lit up by the sun,simple
as it goes around or orbits the earth sometimes the side that people on earth can see is all lit brightly,simple
other times only a small part of the side we see is lit,simple
this is because the moon does not send out its own light,simple
people only see the parts that are being lit by sunlight,simple
these different stages are called phases of the moon,simple
it takes the moon about,simple
days days hours minutes to complete the cycle from big and bright to small and dim and back to big and bright,simple
the phase when the moon passes between the earth and sun is called the new moon,simple
the next phase of the moon is called the waxing crescent followed by the first quarter waxing gibbous then to a full moon,simple
a full moon occurs when the moon and sun are on opposite sides of the earth,simple
as the moon continues its orbit it becomes a waning gibbous third quarter waning crescent and finally back to a new moon,simple
people used the moon to measure time,simple
a month is approximately equal in time to a lunar cycle,simple
the moon always shows the same side to earth,simple
astronomers call this phenomenon tidal locking,simple
this means that half of it can never be seen from earth,simple
the side facing away from earth is called the far side or dark side of the moon even though the sun does shine on it—we just never see it lit,simple
before people stood on the moon the united states and the ussr sent robots to the moon,simple
these robots would orbit the moon or crawl on its surface,simple
the robots were the first man-made objects to touch the moon,simple
humans finally landed on the moon on july,simple
astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin landed their lunar ship the eagle on the surface of the moon,simple
then as half the world watched him on television armstrong climbed down the ladder of the eagle and was the first human to touch the moon as he said that 's one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind,simple
even though their footprints were left on the moon a long time ago it is likely that they are still there as there is no wind or rain making erosion extremely slow,simple
the footprints do not get filled in or smoothed out,simple
more people landed on the moon between and when the last spaceship apollo visited,simple
eugene cernan of apollo was the last person to touch the moon,simple
because it is smaller the moon has less gravity than earth only / of the amount on earth,simple
so if a person weighs kg on earth the person would only weigh kg on the moon,simple
but even though the moon 's gravity is weaker than the earth 's gravity it is still there,simple
if person dropped a ball while standing on the moon it would still fall down,simple
however it would fall much more slowly,simple
a person who jumped as high as possible on the moon would jump higher than on earth but still fall back to the ground,simple
because the moon has no atmosphere there is no air resistance so a feather will fall as fast as a hammer,simple
without an atmosphere the environment is not protected from heat or cold,simple
astronauts wore spacesuits and carried oxygen to breathe,simple
the suit weighed about as much as the astronaut,simple
the moon 's gravity is weak so it was not as heavy as on earth,simple
in the earth the sky is blue because the blue rays of the sun bounce off the gases in the atmosphere making it look like blue light is coming from the sky,simple
but on the moon because there is no atmosphere the sky looks black even in the daytime,simple
and because there is no atmosphere to protect the moon from the rocks that fall from outer space,simple
these meteorites crash right into the moon and make wide shallow holes called craters,simple
the moon has thousands of them,simple
newer craters gradually wear away the older ones,simple
the giant impact hypothesis is that the moon was created out of the debris from a collision between the young earth and a mars-sized protoplanet,simple
this is the favored scientific hypothesis for the formation of the moon,simple
in nasa said that they had found a lot of water on the moon,simple
the water is not liquid but is in the form of hydrates and hydroxides,simple
liquid water can not exist on the moon because photodissociation quickly breaks down the molecules,simple
however from the image nasa received there is a history of water existence,simple
during the cold war the united states army thought about making a military post on the moon able to attack targets on earth,simple
they also considered conducting a nuclear weapon test on the moon,simple
the united states air force had similar plans,simple
however both plans were brushed-off as nasa moved from a military to a civilian-based agency,simple
even though the soviet union left remains on the moon and the united states left a few flags no country has control over the moon,simple
the u,simple
and soviet union both signed the outer space treaty which calls the moon and all of outer space the province of all mankind,simple
this treaty also banned all use of the military of the moon including nuclear weapons tests and military bases,simple
late heavy bombardment,simple
the planets in the solar system have names of greek or roman gods apart from earth because people did not think earth was a planet in old times,simple
however earth is occasionally referred by the name of a roman god : terra,simple
other languages for example chinese use different names,simple
moons also have names of gods and people from classical mythology or from the plays written by shakespeare,simple
here is a list of planets in the solar system,simple
they are ordered by how close they are to the sun nearest first,simple
astronomers speak about major or true planets and minor planets which are smaller objects that go around the sun,simple
some examples of minor planets are asteroids comets and trans-neptunian objects,simple
planets in the solar system are of three sorts : terrestrial or rocky : planets that are similar to earth — in them is mostly rock : mercury venus earth mars,simple
jovian or gas giant : these planets are mostly made of gas : jupiter saturn uranus neptune,simple
uranian planets are a special sort of gas giants they have more hydrogen and helium,simple
icy : sometimes people also have a third sort for bodies such as pluto though pluto is no longer called a planet by everyone,simple
these planets are mostly made of ice,simple
many objects in the solar system that are not planets are also icy,simple
examples are the icy moons of the outer planets of the solar system like triton,simple

dna has a double helix shape which is like a ladder twisted into a spiral,simple
each step of the ladder is a pair of nucleotides,simple
a nucleotide is a molecule made up of : deoxyribose a kind of sugar with carbon atoms a phosphate group made of phosphorus and oxygen and nitrogenous basedna is made of four types of nucleotide : adenine a thymine t cytosine c guanine gthe 'rungs ' of the dna ladder are each made of two bases one base coming from each leg,simple
the bases connect in the middle : 'a ' only pairs with 't ' and 'c ' only pairs with 'g ',simple
the bases are held together by hydrogen bonds,simple
adenine a and thymine t can pair up because they make two hydrogen bonds and cytosine c and guanine g pair up to make three hydrogen bonds,simple
although the bases are always in fixed pairs the pairs can come in any order a-t or t-a similarly c-g or g-c,simple
this way dna can write 'codes ' out of the 'letters ' that are the bases,simple
these codes contain the message that tells the cell what to do,simple
on chromosomes the dna is bound up with proteins called histones to form chromatin,simple
this association takes part in epigenetics and gene regulation,simple
genes are switched on and off during development and cell activity and this regulation is the basis of most of the activity which takes place in cells,simple
when dna is copied this is called dna replication,simple
briefly the hydrogen bonds holding together paired bases are broken and the molecule is split in half : the legs of the ladder are separated,simple
this gives two single strands,simple
new strands are formed by matching the bases a with t and g with c to make the missing strands,simple
first an enzyme called dna helicase splits the dna down the middle by breaking the hydrogen bonds,simple
then after the dna molecule is in two separate pieces another molecule called dna polymerase makes a new strand that matches each of the strands of the split dna molecule,simple
each copy of a dna molecule is made of half of the original starting molecule and half of new bases,simple
when dna is copied mistakes are sometimes made – these are called mutations,simple
there are three main types of mutations : deletion where one or more bases are left out,simple
substitution where one or more bases are substituted for another base in the sequence,simple
insertion where one or more extra base is put in,simple
duplication where a sequence of bases pairs are repeated,simple
mutations may also be classified by their effect on the structure and function of proteins or their effect on fitness,simple
mutations may be bad for the organism or neutral or of benefit,simple
sometimes mutations are fatal for the organism – the protein made by the new dna does not work at all and this causes the embryo to die,simple
on the other hand evolution is moved forward by mutations when the new version of the protein works better for the organism,simple
a section of dna that contains instructions to make a protein is called a gene,simple
each gene has the sequence for at least one polypeptide,simple
proteins form structures and also form enzymes,simple
the enzymes do most of the work in cells,simple
proteins are made out of smaller polypeptides which are formed of amino acids,simple
to make a protein to do a particular job the correct amino acids have to be joined up in the correct order,simple
proteins are made by tiny machines in the cell called ribosomes,simple
ribosomes are in the main body of the cell but dna is only in the nucleus of the cell,simple
the codon is part of the dna but dna never leaves the nucleus,simple
because dna can not leave the nucleus the cell makes a copy of the dna sequence in rna,simple
this is smaller and can get through the holes – pores – in the membrane of the nucleus and out into the cell,simple
genes encoded in dna are transcribed into messenger rna mrna by proteins such as rna polymerase,simple
mature mrna is then used as a template for protein synthesis by the ribosome,simple
ribosomes read codons 'words ' made of three base pairs that tell the ribosome which amino acid to add,simple
the ribosome scans along an mrna reading the code while it makes protein,simple
another rna called trna helps match the right amino acid to each codon,simple
dna was first isolated extracted from cells by swiss physician friedrich miescher in when he was working on bacteria from the pus in surgical bandages,simple
the molecule was found in the nucleus of the cells and so he called it nuclein,simple
in frederick griffith discovered that traits of the smooth form of pneumococcus could be transferred to the rough form of the same bacteria by mixing killed smooth bacteria with the live rough form,simple
this system provided the first clear suggestion that dna carries genetic information,simple
the avery–macleod–mccarty experiment identified dna as the transforming principle in,simple
dna 's role in heredity was confirmed in when alfred hershey and martha chase in the hershey–chase experiment showed that dna is the genetic material of the t bacteriophage,simple
in the s erwin chargaff found that the amount of thymine t present in a molecule of dna was about equal to the amount of adenine a present,simple
he found that the same applies to guanine g and cytosine c,simple
chargaff 's rules summarises this finding,simple
in james d,simple
watson and francis crick suggested what is now accepted as the first correct double-helix model of dna structure in the journal nature,simple
their double-helix molecular model of dna was then based on a single x-ray diffraction image photo taken by rosalind franklin and raymond gosling in may,simple
experimental evidence supporting the watson and crick model was published in a series of five articles in the same issue of nature,simple
of these franklin and gosling 's paper was the first publication of their own x-ray diffraction data and original analysis method that partly supported the watson and crick model this issue also contained an article on dna structure by maurice wilkins and two of his colleagues whose analysis and in vivo b-dna x-ray patterns also supported the presence in vivo of the double-helical dna configurations as proposed by crick and watson for their double-helix molecular model of dna in the previous two pages of nature,simple
in after franklin 's death watson crick and wilkins jointly received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine,simple
nobel prizes were awarded only to living recipients at the time,simple
a debate continues about who should receive credit for the discovery,simple
in crick explained the relationship between dna rna and proteins in the central dogma of molecular biology,simple
how dna was copied the replication mechanism came in through the meselson–stahl experiment,simple
more work by crick and coworkers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of bases called codons,simple
these findings represent the birth of molecular biology,simple
how watson and crick got franklin 's results has been much debated,simple
crick watson and maurice wilkins were awarded the nobel prize in for their work on dna – rosalind franklin had died in,simple

the evidence for evolution is given in a number of books,simple
some of this evidence is discussed here,simple
the realization that some rocks contain fossils was a very important event in natural history,simple
there are three parts to this story : realizing that things in rocks which looked organic actually were the altered remains of living things,simple
this was settled in the th and th centuries by conrad gessner nicolaus steno robert hooke and others,simple
realizing that many fossils represented species which do not exist today,simple
it was georges cuvier the comparative anatomist who proved that extinction occurred and that different strata contained different fossils,simple
p realizing that early fossils were simpler organisms than later fossils,simple
also the later the rocks the more like the present day are the fossils,simple
the most convincing evidence for the occurrence of evolution is the discovery of extinct organisms in older geological strata,simple
the older the strata are,simple
the more different the fossil will be from living representatives,simple
that is to be expected if the fauna and flora of the earlier strata had gradually evolved into their descendants,simple
the evolution of the horse family equidae is a good example of the way that evolution works,simple
the oldest fossil of a horse is about million years old,simple
it was a small animal with five toes on the front feet and four on the hind feet,simple
at that time there were more forests in the world than today,simple
this horse lived in woodland eating leaves nuts and fruit with its simple teeth,simple
it was only about as big as a fox,simple
about million years ago the world started to become cooler and drier,simple
forests shrank grassland expanded and horses changed,simple
they ate grass they grew larger and they ran faster because they had to escape faster predators,simple
because grass wears teeth out horses with longer-lasting teeth had an advantage,simple
for most of this long period of time there were a number of horse types genera,simple
now however only one genus exists : the modern horse equus,simple
it has teeth which grow all its life hooves on single toes great long legs for running and the animal is big and strong enough to survive in the open plain,simple
horses lived in western canada until years ago but all horses in north america became extinct about years ago,simple
the causes of this extinction are not yet clear,simple
climate change and over-hunting by humans are suggested,simple
so scientists can see that changes have happened,simple
they have happened slowly over a long time,simple
how these changes have come about is explained by the theory of evolution,simple
this is a topic which fascinated both charles darwin and alfred russel wallace,simple
when new species occur usually by the splitting of older species this takes place in one place in the world,simple
once it is established a new species may spread to some places and not others,simple
australasia has been separated from other continents for many millions of years,simple
in the main part of the continent australia of mammals of reptiles of fish and insects and of amphibians are endemic,simple
its native mammals are mostly marsupials like kangaroos bandicoots and quolls,simple
by contrast marsupials are today totally absent from africa and form a small portion of the mammalian fauna of south america where opossums shrew opossums and the monito del monte occur see the great american interchange,simple
the only living representatives of primitive egg-laying mammals monotremes are the echidnas and the platypus,simple
they are only found in australasia which includes tasmania new guinea and kangaroo island,simple
these monotremes are totally absent in the rest of the world,simple
on the other hand australia is missing many groups of placental mammals that are common on other continents carnivora artiodactyls shrews squirrels lagomorphs although it does have indigenous bats and rodents which arrived later,simple
the evolutionary story is that placental mammals evolved in eurasia and wiped out the marsupials and monotremes wherever they spread,simple
they did not reach australasia until more recently,simple
that is the simple reason why australia has most of the world 's marsupials and all the world 's monotremes,simple
in about sq mi km the hawaiian islands have the most diverse collection of drosophila flies in the world living from rainforests to mountain meadows,simple
about hawaiian drosophilid species are known,simple
genetic evidence shows that all the native drosophilid species in hawaiʻi have descended from a single ancestral species that colonized the islands about million years ago,simple
the subsequent adaptive radiation was spurred by a lack of competition and a wide variety of vacant niches,simple
although it would be possible for a single pregnant female to colonise an island it is more likely to have been a group from the same species,simple
the combination of continental drift and evolution can explain what is found in the fossil record,simple
glossopteris is an extinct species of seed fern plants from the permian period on the ancient supercontinent of gondwana,simple
glossopteris fossils are found in permian strata in southeast south america southeast africa all of madagascar northern india all of australia all of new zealand and scattered on the southern and northern edges of antarctica,simple
during the permian these continents were connected as gondwana,simple
this is known from magnetic striping in the rocks other fossil distributions and glacial scratches pointing away from the temperate climate of the south pole during the permian,simple
p,simple
when biologists look at living things they see that animals and plants belong to groups which have something in common,simple
charles darwin explained that this followed naturally if we admit the common parentage of allied forms together with their modification through variation and natural selection,simple
ppfor example all insects are related,simple
they share a basic body plan whose development is controlled by master regulatory genes,simple
they have six legs they have hard parts on the outside of the body an exoskeleton they have eyes formed of many separate chambers and so on,simple
biologists explain this with evolution,simple
all insects are the descendants of a group of animals who lived a long time ago,simple
they still keep the basic plan six legs and so on but the details change,simple
they look different now because they changed in different ways : this is evolution,simple
it was darwin who first suggested that all life on earth had a single origin and from that beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved,simple
p evidence from molecular biology in recent years has supported the idea that all life is related by common descent,simple
strong evidence for common descent comes from vestigial structures,simple
p the useless wings of flightless beetles are sealed under fused wing covers,simple
this can be simply explained by their descent from ancestral beetles which had wings that worked,simple
prudimentary body parts those that are smaller and simpler in structure than corresponding parts in ancestral species are called vestigial organs,simple
those organs are functional in the ancestral species but are now either nonfunctional or re-adapted to a new function,simple
examples are the pelvic girdles of whales halteres hind wings of flies wings of flightless birds and the leaves of some xerophytes e,simple
g,simple
cactus and parasitic plants e,simple
g,simple
dodder,simple
however vestigial structures may have their original function replaced with another,simple
for example the halteres in flies help balance the insect while in flight and the wings of ostriches are used in mating rituals and in aggressive display,simple
the ear ossicles in mammals are former bones of the lower jaw,simple
rudimentary organs plainly declare their origin and meaning,simple
p,simple
rudimentary organs,simple
are the record of a former state of things and have been retained solely though the powers of inheritance,simple
far from being a difficulty as they assuredly do on the old doctrine of creation might even have been anticipated in accordance with the views here explained p,simple
charles darwin,simple
in robert wiedersheim published a book on human anatomy and its relevance to man 's evolutionary history,simple
this book contained a list of human organs that he considered vestigial,simple
this list included examples such as the appendix and the rd molar teeth wisdom teeth,simple
the strong grip of a baby is another example,simple
it is a vestigial reflex a remnant of the past when pre-human babies clung to their mothers ' hair as the mothers swung through the trees,simple
this is borne out by the babies ' feet which curl up when it is sitting down primate babies grip with the feet as well,simple
all primates except modern man have thick body hair to which an infant can cling unlike modern humans,simple
the grasp reflex allows the mother to escape danger by climbing a tree using both hands and feet,simple
vestigial organs often have some selection against them,simple
the original organs took resources sometimes huge resources,simple
if they no longer have a function reducing their size improves fitness,simple
and there is direct evidence of selection,simple
some cave crustacea reproduce more successfully with smaller eyes than do those with larger eyes,simple
this may be because the nervous tissue dealing with sight now becomes available to handle other sensory input,simple
p,simple
from the eighteenth century it was known that embryos of different species were much more similar than the adults,simple
in particular some parts of embryos reflect their evolutionary past,simple
for example the embryos of land vertebrates develop gill slits like fish embryos,simple
of course this is only a temporary stage which gives rise to many structures in the neck of reptiles birds and mammals,simple
the proto-gill slits are part of a complicated system of development : that is why they persisted,simple
another example are the embryonic teeth of baleen whales,simple
they are later lost,simple
the baleen filter is developed from different tissue called keratin,simple
early fossil baleen whales did actually have teeth as well as the baleen,simple
a good example is the barnacle,simple
it took many centuries before natural historians discovered that barnacles were crustacea,simple
their adults look so unlike other crustacea but their larvae are very similar to those of other crustacea,simple
charles darwin lived in a world where animal husbandry and domesticated crops were vitally important,simple
in both cases farmers selected for breeding individuals with special properties and prevented the breeding of individuals with less desirable characteristics,simple
the eighteenth and early nineteenth century saw a growth in scientific agriculture and artificial breeding was part of this,simple
darwin discussed artificial selection as a model for natural selection in the first edition of his work on the origin of species in chapter iv : natural selection : slow though the process of selection may be if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection i can see no limit to the amount of change,simple
which may be effected in the long course of time by nature 's power of selection,simple
p nikolai vavilov showed that rye originally a weed came to be a crop plant by unintentional selection,simple
rye is a tougher plant than wheat : it survives in harsher conditions,simple
having become a crop like the wheat rye was able to become a crop plant in harsh areas such as hills and mountains,simple
there is no real difference in the genetic processes underlying artificial and natural selection and the concept of artificial selection was used by charles darwin as an illustration of the wider process of natural selection,simple
there are practical differences,simple
experimental studies of artificial selection show that the rate of evolution in selection experiments is at least two orders of magnitude that is times greater than any rate seen in nature or the fossil record,simple
p,simple
some have thought that artificial selection could not produce new species,simple
it now seems that it can,simple
new species have been created by domesticated animal husbandry but the details are not known or not clear,simple
for example domestic sheep were created by hybridisation and no longer produce viable offspring with ovis orientalis one species from which they are descended,simple
domestic cattle on the other hand can be considered the same species as several varieties of wild ox gaur yak etc,simple
as they readily produce fertile offspring with them,simple
the best-documented new species came from laboratory experiments in the late s,simple
william rice and g,simple
w,simple
salt bred fruit flies drosophila melanogaster using a maze with three different choices of habitat such as light/dark and wet/dry,simple
each generation was put into the maze and the groups of flies that came out of two of the eight exits were set apart to breed with each other in their respective groups,simple
after thirty-five generations the two groups and their offspring were isolated reproductively because of their strong habitat preferences : they mated only within the areas they preferred and so did not mate with flies that preferred the other areas,simple
diane dodd was also able to show how reproductive isolation can develop from mating preferences in drosophila pseudoobscura fruit flies after only eight generations using different food types starch and maltose,simple
dodd 's experiment has been easy for others to repeat,simple
it has also been done with other fruit flies and foods,simple
some biologists say that evolution has happened when a trait that is caused by genetics becomes more or less common in a group of organisms,simple
others call it evolution when new species appear,simple
changes can happen quickly in the smaller simpler organisms,simple
for example many bacteria that cause disease can no longer be killed with some of the antibiotic medicines,simple
these medicines have only been in use about eighty years and at first worked extremely well,simple
the bacteria have evolved so that they are no longer affected by antibiotics anymore,simple
the drugs killed off all the bacteria except a few which had some resistance,simple
these few resistant bacteria produced the next generation,simple
the colorado beetle is famous for its ability to resist pesticides,simple
over the last years it has become resistant to chemical compounds used in insecticides including cyanide,simple
this is natural selection speeded up by the artificial conditions,simple
however not every population is resistant to every chemical,simple
the populations only become resistant to chemicals used in their area,simple
although there were a number of natural historians in the th century who had some idea of evolution the first well-formed ideas came in the th century,simple
three biologists are most important,simple
jean-baptiste de lamarck – a french biologist claimed that animals changed according to natural laws,simple
he said that animals could pass on traits they had acquired during their lifetime to their offspring using inheritance,simple
today his theory is known as lamarckism,simple
its main purpose is to explain adaptations by natural means,simple
he proposed a tendency for organisms to become more complex moving up a ladder of progress plus use and disuse,simple
lamarck 's idea was that a giraffe 's neck grew longer because it tried to reach higher up,simple
this idea failed because it can not be reconciled with heredity mendel 's work,simple
mendel made his discoveries about half a century after lamarck 's work,simple
charles darwin – wrote his on the origin of species in,simple
in this book he put forward much evidence that evolution had occurred,simple
he also proposed natural selection as the way evolution had taken place,simple
but darwin did not understand about genetics and how traits were actually passed on,simple
he could not accurately explain what made children look like their parents,simple
nevertheless darwin 's explanation of evolution was fundamentally correct,simple
in contrast to lamarck darwin 's idea was that the giraffe 's neck became longer because those with longer necks survived better,simple
p/ these survivors passed their genes on and in time the whole race got longer necks,simple
an austrian monk called gregor mendel – bred plants,simple
in the mid-th century he discovered how traits were passed on from one generation to the next,simple
he used peas for his experiments : some peas have white flowers and others have red ones,simple
some peas have green seeds and others have yellow seeds,simple
mendel used artificial pollination to breed the peas,simple
his results are discussed further in mendelian inheritance,simple
darwin thought that the inheritance from both parents blended together,simple
mendel proved that the genes from the two parents stay separate and may be passed on unchanged to later generations,simple
mendel published his results in a journal that was not well-known and his discoveries were overlooked,simple
around his work was rediscovered,simple
genes are bits of information made of dna which work like a set of instructions,simple
a set of genes are in every living cell,simple
together genes organise the way an egg develops into an adult,simple
with mammals and many other living things a copy of each gene comes from the father and another copy from the mother,simple
some living organisms including some plants only have one parent so get all their genes from them,simple
these genes produce the genetic differences which evolution acts on,simple
darwin 's on the origin of species has two themes : the evidence for evolution and his ideas on how evolution took place,simple
this section deals with the second issue,simple
the first two chapters of the origin deal with variation in domesticated plants and animals and variation in nature,simple
all living things show variation,simple
every population which has been studied shows that animal and plants vary as much as humans do,simple
p this is a great fact of nature and without it evolution would not occur,simple
darwin said that just as man selects what he wants in his farm animals so in nature the variations allow natural selection to work,simple
the features of an individual are influenced by two things heredity and environment,simple
first development is controlled by genes inherited from the parents,simple
second living brings its own influences,simple
some things are entirely inherited others partly and some not inherited at all,simple
the colour of eyes is entirely inherited they are a genetic trait,simple
height or weight is only partly inherited and the language is not at all inherited,simple
just to be clear : the fact that humans can speak is inherited but what language is spoken depends on where a person lives and what they are taught,simple
another example : a person inherits a brain of somewhat variable capacity,simple
what happens after birth depends on many things such as home environment education and other experiences,simple
when a person is adult their brain is what their inheritance and life experience have made it,simple
evolution only concerns the traits which can be inherited wholly or partly,simple
the hereditary traits are passed on from one generation to the next through the genes,simple
a person 's genes contain all the traits which they inherit from their parents,simple
the accidents of life are not passed on,simple
also of course each person lives a somewhat different life : that increases the differences,simple
organisms in any population vary in reproductive success,simple
p from the point of view of evolution 'reproductive success ' means the total number of offspring which live to breed and leave offspring themselves,simple
variation can only affect future generations if it is inherited,simple
because of the work of gregor mendel we know that much variation is inherited,simple
mendel 's 'factors ' are now called genes,simple
research has shown that almost every individual in a sexually reproducing species is genetically unique,simple
pgenetic variation is increased by gene mutations,simple
dna does not always reproduce exactly,simple
rare changes occur and these changes can be inherited,simple
many changes in dna cause faults some are neutral or even advantageous,simple
this gives rise to genetic variation which is the seed-corn of evolution,simple
sexual reproduction by the crossing over of chromosomes during meiosis spreads variation through the population,simple
other events like natural selection and drift reduce variation,simple
so a population in the wild always has variation but the details are always changing,simple
p,simple
evolution mainly works by natural selection,simple
what does this mean ? animals and plants which are best suited to their environment will on average survive better,simple
there is a struggle for existence,simple
those who survive will produce the next generation,simple
their genes will be passed on and the genes of those who did not reproduce will not,simple
this is the basic mechanism which changes a population and causes evolution,simple
natural selection explains why living organisms change over time to have the anatomy the functions and behaviour that they have,simple
it works like this : all living things have such fertility that their population size could increase rapidly for ever,simple
we see that the size of populations does not increase to this extent,simple
mostly numbers remain about the same,simple
the food and other resources are limited,simple
therefore there is competition for food and resources,simple
no two individuals are alike,simple
therefore they will not have the same chances to live and reproduce,simple
much of this variation can be inherited,simple
parents pass such traits to the children through their genes,simple
the next generation can only come from those that survive and reproduce,simple
after many generations of this the population will have more helpful genetic differences and fewer harmful ones,simple
natural selection is really a process of elimination,simple
p the elimination is being caused by the relative fit between individuals and the environment they live in,simple
there are now many cases where natural selection has been proved to occur in wild populations,simple
almost every case investigated of camouflage mimicry and polymorphism has shown strong effects of selection,simple
the force of selection can be much stronger than was thought by the early population geneticists,simple
the resistance to pesticides has grown quickly,simple
resistance to warfarin in norway rats rattus norvegicus grew rapidly because those that survived made up more and more of the population,simple
research showed that in the absence of warfarin the resistant homozygote was at a disadvantage to the normal wild type homozygote,simple
p this great disadvantage was quickly overcome by the selection for warfarin resistance,simple
mammals normally can not drink milk as adults but humans are an exception,simple
milk is digested by the enzyme lactase which switches off as mammals stop taking milk from their mothers,simple
the human ability to drink milk during adult life is supported by a lactase mutation which prevents this switch-off,simple
human populations have a high proportion of this mutation wherever milk is important in the diet,simple
the spread of this 'milk tolerance ' is promoted by natural selection because it helps people survive where milk is available,simple
genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations causing lactase persistence only reached high levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years,simple
therefore lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution,simple
as lactase persistence is genetic but animal husbandry a cultural trait this is gene–culture coevolution,simple
adaptation is one of the basic phenomena of biology,simple
through the process of adaptation an organism becomes better suited to its habitat,simple
adaptation is one of the two main processes that explain the diverse species we see in biology,simple
the other is speciation species-splitting or cladogenesis,simple
a favourite example used today to study the interplay of adaptation and speciation is the evolution of cichlid fish in african rivers and lakes,simple
when people speak about adaptation they often mean something which helps an animal or plant survive,simple
one of the most widespread adaptations in animals is the evolution of the eye,simple
another example is the adaptation of horses ' teeth to grinding grass,simple
camouflage is another adaptation so is mimicry,simple
the better adapted animals are the most likely to survive and to reproduce successfully natural selection,simple
an internal parasite such as a fluke is a good example : it has a very simple bodily structure but still the organism is highly adapted to its particular environment,simple
from this we see that adaptation is not just a matter of visible traits : in such parasites critical adaptations take place in the life cycle which is often quite complex,simple
not all features of an organism are adaptations,simple
p adaptations tend to reflect the past life of a species,simple
if a species has recently changed its life style a once valuable adaptation may become useless and eventually become a dwindling vestige,simple
adaptations are never perfect,simple
there are always tradeoffs between the various functions and structures in a body,simple
it is the organism as a whole which lives and reproduces therefore it is the complete set of adaptations which gets passed on to future generations,simple
in populations there are forces which add variation to the population such as mutation and forces which remove it,simple
genetic drift is the name given to random changes which remove variation from a population,simple
genetic drift gets rid of variation at the rate of /n where n = population size,simple
p it is therefore a very weak evolutionary force in large populations,simple
pgenetic drift explains how random chance can affect evolution in surprisingly big ways but only when populations are quite small,simple
overall its action is to make the individuals more similar to each other and hence more vulnerable to disease or to chance events in their environment,simple
drift reduces genetic variation in populations potentially reducing a population ’ s ability to survive new selective pressures,simple
genetic drift acts faster and has more drastic results in smaller populations,simple
small populations usually become extinct,simple
genetic drift may contribute to speciation if the small group does survive,simple
bottleneck events : when a large population is suddenly and drastically reduced in size by some event the genetic variety will be very much reduced,simple
infections and extreme climate events are frequent causes,simple
occasionally invasions by more competitive species can be devastating,simple
♦ in the /s hunting reduced the northern elephant seal to only about individuals,simple
although the population has rebounded its genetic variability is much less than that of the southern elephant seal,simple
♦ cheetahs have very little variation,simple
we think the species was reduced to a small number at some recent time,simple
because it lacks genetic variation it is in danger from infectious diseases,simple
founder events : these occur when a small group buds off from a larger population,simple
the small group then lives separately from the main population,simple
the human species is often quoted as having been through such stages,simple
for example when groups left africa to set up elsewhere see human evolution,simple
apparently we have less variation than would be expected from our worldwide distribution,simple
groups that arrive on islands far from the mainland are also good examples,simple
these groups by virtue of their small size can not carry the full range of alleles to be found in the parent population,simple
how species form is a major part of evolutionary biology,simple
darwin interpreted 'evolution ' a word he did not use at first as being about speciation,simple
that is why he called his famous book on the origin of species,simple
darwin thought most species arose directly from pre-existing species,simple
this is called anagenesis : new species by older species changing,simple
now we think most species arise by previous species splitting : cladogenesis,simple
two groups that start the same can also become very different if they live in different places,simple
when a species gets split into two geographical regions a process starts,simple
each adapts to its own situation,simple
after a while individuals from one group can no longer reproduce with the other group,simple
two good species have evolved from one,simple
a german explorer moritz wagner during his three years in algeria in the s studied flightless beetles,simple
each species is confined to a stretch of the north coast between rivers which descend from the atlas mountains to the mediterranean,simple
as soon as one crosses a river a different but closely related species appears,simple
he wrote later :,simple
a [ new ] species will only [ arise ] when a few individuals [ cross ] the limiting borders of their range,simple
the formation of a new race will never succeed,simple
without a long continued separation of the colonists from the other members of their species,simple
this was an early account of the importance of geographical separation,simple
another biologist who thought geographical separation was critical was ernst mayr,simple
one example of natural speciation is the three-spined stickleback a sea fish that after the last ice age invaded freshwater and set up colonies in isolated lakes and streams,simple
over about generations the sticklebacks show great differences including variations in fins changes in the number or size of their bony plates variable jaw structure and color differences,simple
the wombats of australia fall into two main groups common wombats and hairy-nosed wombats,simple
the two types look very similar apart from the hairiness of their noses,simple
however they are adapted to different environments,simple
common wombats live in forested areas and eat mostly green food with lots of moisture,simple
they often feed in the daytime,simple
hairy-nosed wombats live on hot dry plains where they eat dry grass with very little water or goodness in it,simple
their metabolic system is slow and they sleep most of the day underground,simple
when two groups that started the same become different enough then they become two different species,simple
part of the theory of evolution is that all living things started off the same but then split off into different groups over billions of years,simple
this was an important movement in evolutionary biology which started in the s and finished in the s,simple
it has been updated regularly ever since,simple
the synthesis explains how the ideas of charles darwin fit with the discoveries of gregor mendel who found out how we inherit our genes,simple
the modern synthesis brought darwin 's idea up to date,simple
it bridged the gap between different types of biologists : geneticists naturalists and palaeontologists,simple
when the theory of evolution was developed it was not clear that natural selection and genetics worked together,simple
but ronald fisher showed that natural selection would work to change species,simple
sewall wright explained genetic drift in,simple
evolution and genetics : evolution can be explained by what we know about genetics and what we see of animals and plants living in the wild,simple
thinking in terms of populations rather than individuals is important,simple
the genetic variety existing in natural populations is a key factor in evolution,simple
evolution and fossils : the same factors which act today also acted in the past,simple
gradualism : evolution is gradual and usually takes place by small steps,simple
there are some exceptions to this notably polyploidy especially in plants,simple
natural selection : the struggle for existence of animals and plant in the wild causes natural selection,simple
the strength of natural selection in the wild was greater than even darwin expected,simple
genetic drift can be important in small populations,simple
the rate of evolution can vary,simple
there is very good evidence from fossils that different groups can evolve at different rates and that different parts of an animal can evolve at different rates,simple
p,simple
,simple
co-evolution is where the existence of one species is tightly bound up with the life of one or more other species,simple
new or 'improved ' adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of related features in the other species,simple
the life and death of living things is intimately connected not just with the physical environment but with the life of other species,simple
these relationships may continue for millions of years as it has in the pollination of flowering plants by insects,simple
the gut contents wing structures and mouthparts of fossilized beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators,simple
the association between beetles and angiosperms during the lower cretaceous period led to parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects into the late cretaceous,simple
the evolution of nectaries in upper cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenoptera and angiosperms,simple
charles darwin was the first to use this metaphor in biology,simple
the evolutionary tree shows the relationships among various biological groups,simple
it includes data from dna rna and protein analysis,simple
tree of life work is a product of traditional comparative anatomy and modern molecular evolution and molecular clock research,simple
the major figure in this work is carl woese who defined the archaea the third domain or kingdom of life,simple
below is a simplified version of present-day understanding,simple
macroevolution : the study of changes above the species level and how they take place,simple
the basic data for such a study are fossils palaeontology and the reconstruction of ancient environments,simple
some subjects whose study falls within the realm of macroevolution : adaptive radiation such as the cambrian explosion,simple
changes in biodiversity through time,simple
mass extinctions,simple
speciation and extinction rates,simple
the debate between punctuated equilibrium and gradualism,simple
the role of development in shaping evolution : heterochrony hox genes,simple
origin of major categories : cleidoic egg origin of birds,simple
it is a term of convenience : for most biologists it does not suggest any change in the process of evolution,simple
p for some palaeontologists what they see in the fossil record can not be explained just by the gradualist evolutionary synthesis,simple
they are in the minority,simple
altruism – the willingness of some to sacrifice themselves for others – is widespread in social animals,simple
as explained above the next generation can only come from those who survive and reproduce,simple
some biologists have thought that this meant altruism could not evolve by the normal process of selection,simple
instead a process called group selection was proposed,simple
group selection refers to the idea that alleles can become fixed or spread in a population because of the benefits they bestow on groups regardless of the alleles ' effect on the fitness of individuals within that group,simple
for several decades critiques cast serious doubt on group selection as a major mechanism of evolution,simple
in simple cases it can be seen at once that traditional selection suffices,simple
for example if one sibling sacrifices itself for three siblings the genetic disposition for the act will be increased,simple
this is because siblings share on average of their genetic inheritance and the sacrificial act has led to greater representation of the genes in the next generation,simple
altruism is now generally seen as emerging from standard selection,simple
the warning note from ernst mayr and the work of william hamilton are both important to this discussion,simple
hamilton 's equation describes whether or not a gene for altruistic behaviour will spread in a population,simple
the gene will spread if rxb is greater than c : r b c \displaystyle rbc\ where : c \displaystyle c\ is the reproductive cost to the altruist b \displaystyle b\ is the reproductive benefit to the recipient of the altruistic behavior and r \displaystyle r\ is the probability above the population average of the individuals sharing an altruistic gene – the degree of relatedness,simple
at first sexual reproduction might seem to be at a disadvantage compared with asexual reproduction,simple
in order to be advantageous sexual reproduction cross-fertilisation has to overcome a two-fold disadvantage takes two to reproduce plus the difficulty of finding a mate,simple
why then is sex so nearly universal among eukaryotes ? this is one of the oldest questions in biology,simple
the answer has been given since darwin 's time : because the sexual populations adapt better to changing circumstances,simple
a recent laboratory experiment suggests this is indeed the correct explanation,simple
when populations are outcrossed genetic recombination occurs between different parental genomes,simple
this allows beneficial mutations to escape deleterious alleles on its original background and to combine with other beneficial alleles that arise elsewhere in the population,simple
in selfing populations individuals are largely homozygous and recombination has no effect,simple
in the main experiment nematode worms were divided into two groups,simple
one group was entirely outcrossing the other was entirely selfing,simple
the groups were subjected to a rugged terrain and repeatedly subjected to a mutagen,simple
after generations the selfing population showed a substantial decline in fitness = survival whereas the outcrossing population showed no decline,simple
this is one of a number of studies that show sexuality to have real advantages over non-sexual types of reproduction,simple
an important activity is artificial selection for domestication,simple
this is when people choose which animals to breed from based on their traits,simple
humans have used this for thousands of years to domesticate plants and animals,simple
more recently it has become possible to use genetic engineering,simple
new techniques such as 'gene targeting ' are now available,simple
the purpose of this is to insert new genes or knock out old genes from the genome of a plant or animal,simple
a number of nobel prizes have already been awarded for this work,simple
however the real purpose of studying evolution is to explain and help our understanding of biology,simple
after all it is the first good explanation of how living things came to be the way they are,simple
that is a big achievement,simple
the practical things come mostly from genetics the science started by gregor mendel and from molecular and cell biology,simple
in the journal nature selected topics as 'evolution gems ',simple
these were :,simple
land-living ancestors of whales from water to land see tetrapod the origin of feathers see origin of birds the evolutionary history of teeth the origin of vertebrate skeleton,simple
natural selection in speciation natural selection in lizards a case of co-adaptation differential dispersal in wild birds selective survival in wild guppies evolutionary history matters,simple
darwin 's galapagos finches microevolution meets macroevolution toxin resistance in snakes and clams variation versus stabilitynature is the oldest scientific weekly journal,simple
the link downloads as a free text file complete with references,simple
the idea is to make the information available to teachers,simple
,simple
the idea that all life evolved had been proposed before charles darwin published on the origin of species,simple
even today some people still discuss the concept of evolution and what it means to them their philosophy and their religion,simple
evolution does explain some things about our human nature,simple
people also talk about the social implications of evolution for example in sociobiology,simple
some people have the religious belief that life on earth was created by a god,simple
in order to fit in the idea of evolution with that belief people have used ideas like guided evolution or theistic evolution,simple
they say that evolution is real but is being guided in some way,simple
there are many different concepts of theistic evolution,simple
many creationists believe that the creation myth found in their religion goes against the idea of evolution,simple
as darwin realised the most controversial part of the evolutionary thought is what it means for human origins,simple
in some countries especially in the united states there is tension between people who accept the idea of evolution and those who do not accept it,simple
the debate is mostly about whether evolution should be taught in schools and in what way this should be done,simple
other fields like cosmology and earth science also do not match with the original writings of many religious texts,simple
these ideas were once also fiercely opposed,simple
death for heresy was threatened to those who wrote against the idea that earth was the center of the universe,simple
evolutionary biology is a more recent idea,simple
certain religious groups oppose the idea of evolution more than other religious groups do,simple
for instance the roman catholic church now has the following position on evolution : pope pius xii said in his encyclical humani generis published in the s : the church does not forbid that,simple
research and discussions,simple
take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter,simple
pope pius xii humani generispope john paul ii updated this position in,simple
he said that evolution was more than a hypothesis : in his encyclical humani generis my predecessor pius xii has already [ said ] that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith regarding man and his vocation,simple
,simple
today more than a half-century after,simple
that encyclical some new findings lead us toward the recognition of evolution as more than an hypothesis,simple
in fact it is remarkable that this theory has had progressively greater influence on the spirit of researchers following a series of discoveries in different scholarly disciplines,simple
pope john paul ii speaking to the pontifical academy of sciencethe anglican communion also does not oppose the scientific account of evolution,simple
many of those who accepted evolution were not much interested in biology,simple
they were interested in using the theory to support their own ideas on society,simple
some people have tried to use evolution to support racism,simple
people wanting to justify racism claimed that certain groups such as black people were inferior,simple
in nature some animals do survive better than others and it does lead to animals better adapted to their circumstances,simple
with humans groups from different parts of the world all evolution can say is that each group is probably well suited to its original situation,simple
evolution makes no judgements about better or worse,simple
it does not say that any human group is superior to any other,simple
this amazing idea of eugenics was rather different,simple
two things had been noticed as far back as the th century,simple
one was the great success of farmers in breeding cattle and crop plants,simple
they did this by selecting which animals or plants would produce the next generation artificial selection,simple
the other observation was that lower class people had more children than upper-class people,simple
if and it 's a big if the higher classes were there on merit then their lack of children was the exact reverse of what should be happening,simple
faster breeding in the lower classes would lead to the society getting worse,simple
the idea to improve the human species by selective breeding is called eugenics,simple
the name was proposed by francis galton a bright scientist who meant to do good,simple
he said that the human stock gene pool should be improved by selective breeding policies,simple
this would mean that those who were considered good stock would receive a reward if they reproduced,simple
however other people suggested that those considered bad stock would need to undergo compulsory sterilization prenatal testing and birth control,simple
the german nazi government – used eugenics as a cover for their extreme racial policies with dreadful results,simple
the problem with galton 's idea is how to decide which features to select,simple
there are so many different skills people could have you could not agree who was good stock and who was bad stock,simple
there was rather more agreement on who should not be breeding,simple
several countries passed laws for the compulsory sterilisation of unwelcome groups,simple
most of these laws were passed between and,simple
after world war ii disgust at what the nazis had done squashed any more attempts at eugenics,simple
some equations can be solved using algorithms that simulate evolution,simple
evolutionary algorithms work like that,simple
another example of using ideas about evolution to support social action is social darwinism,simple
social darwinism is a term given to the ideas of the th century social philosopher herbert spencer,simple
spencer believed the survival of the fittest could and should be applied to commerce and human societies as a whole,simple
again some people used these ideas to claim that racism and ruthless economic policies were justified,simple
today most biologists and philosophers say that the theory of evolution should not be applied to social policy,simple
some people disagree with the idea of evolution,simple
they disagree with it for a number of reasons,simple
most often these reasons are influenced by or based on their religious beliefs,simple
people who do not agree with evolution usually believe in creationism or intelligent design,simple
despite this evolution is one of the most successful theories in science,simple
people have discovered it to be useful for different kinds of research,simple
none of the other suggestions explain things such as fossil records as well,simple
so for almost all scientists evolution is not in doubt,simple
human evolution,simple
there are different organ systems such as the cardiovascular system also known as the circulatory system the system that gets blood around the body the muscular system the system that contains muscles the nervous system the system that controls the nervesand the brain and the skeleton the bones,simple
anatomy physiology and biochemistry are similar basic medical sciences,simple

cancer is one of the most common causes of death around the world,simple
it causes about,simple
or one out of every eight of all deaths worldwide according to the world health organization,simple
different types of cancer have different causes,simple
some things are known to cause cancer in a specific body part other things are known to be able to cause many different types of cancer,simple
for example using tobacco smoked or smokeless can cause many types of cancers such as lung mouth tongue and throat cancers,simple
other things that are known to be able to cause cancer - or make a person more likely to get cancer - include : radiation including sunlight and x-rays in large or many doses and exposure to radiation for example in a nuclear power plant chemicals and materials used in building and manufacturing for example asbestos and benzene high-fat or low-fiber diets air and water pollution eating very little fruits and vegetables obesity not enough physical activity drinking too much alcohol and certain chemicals commonly used at home,simple
some cancers can also be caused by viruses,simple
many people who are exposed to these things do get cancer - but some do not,simple
there are many different kinds of cancers,simple
some of the most common are : breast cancer brain cancer leukemia a blood cancer testicular cancer mesothelioma which starts in the lungs and is usually caused by breathing in asbestos for long periods of time lung cancer,simple
there is no sure cure for cancer,simple
it can only be cured if all of the cancerous cells are cut out or killed in place,simple
this means that the earlier the cancer is treated the better the chances are for a cure because the cancer cells may not have had enough time to copy themselves and spread so much that the person can not be cured,simple
there are a few different types of treatments that are used to try to kill cancer cells,simple
these treatments are : radiotherapy radiation therapy which uses radiation to kill cancer cells chemotherapy which uses strong medications to kill cancer cells immunotherapy works by inducing enhancing or suppressing an immune response,simple
surgery to take out part or all of a tumor after surgery many patients may need radiotherapy or chemotherapy to keep the tumor from growing again,simple
there are a few reasons why treating cancer is complicated,simple
for example : most things that kill cancer cells also kill normal healthy cells,simple
this can cause many side effects like hair loss and vomiting,simple
the body 's immune system usually will not attack cancer cells even though they could easily kill the body,simple
this is because the cancer has actually become a part of the body by invading cells and tissues,simple
so the immune system sees the cancer as part of the body it is trying to protect not as a threat to be attacked,simple
there are many different types of cancer and each has its own symptoms and causes,simple
even with the same type of cancer different people may have different symptoms and may react to treatments differently their cancer also may grow or spread at different speeds,simple
treatment has to be a good fit to both the type of cancer and the individual patient who has the cancer,simple
many many people in many countries study cancer and work on finding treatments,simple
there has been some good progress in finding treatments and many cancers are treated with success,simple
along with looking for different medical treatments to treat cancer some studies also look for things that people with cancer can do themselves to try to make themselves healthier,simple
for example one study showed that if a person with lymphedema a swelling of the arm linked to breast cancer lifts weights he may be able to fight his cancer better than somebody who does not lift weights,simple
cancer has been around for many thousands of years,simple
today a lot of the medical terms used to describe cancer come from ancient greek and latin,simple
for example the latinized greek word carcinoma is used to describe a malignant tumor - a tumor made up of cancer cells,simple
the greeks also used the word karkinos which would be translated by aulus cornelius celsus into the latin word cancer,simple
the prefix 'carcino ' is still used in medical words like carcinoma and carcinogenic,simple
a famous greek doctor galen helped create another word that is very important to medicine today by using the word onkos to describe all tumours,simple
this is where the word oncology the branch of medicine that deals with cancer comes from,simple
hippocrates a very famous ancient doctor who is often called the father of modern medicine named many kinds of cancer,simple
he called benign tumours tumors that are not made up of cancer cells oncos,simple
in greek onkos means 'swelling ',simple
he called malignant tumours karkinos,simple
this means crab or crayfish in greek,simple
he used this term because he thought that if a solid malignant tumor was cut into its veins looked like a crab : the veins stretched on all sides as the animal the crab has its feet whence it derives gets its name,simple
hippocrates later added -oma greek for 'swelling ' after the word 'carcinos ',simple
this is how the word carcinoma came about,simple
because the ancient greeks did not believe in opening up dead bodies to study them hippocrates was only able to describe and make drawings of tumors he saw from the outside of the body,simple
he drew tumors that had been on the skin nose and breasts,simple
hippocrates and other doctors at that time treated people based on the humor theory,simple
this theory said that there were four types of fluid in the body black yellow bile blood and phlegm,simple
doctors tried to figure out whether these four humors or body fluids were in balance,simple
they would then use treatments like blood-letting cutting the patient and letting him bleed so that he would lose blood laxatives giving the patient foods or herbs to make him go to the bathroom and/or changing the patient 's diet,simple
the doctors thought that these treatments would work to get the patient 's four humors back into the right balance,simple
the humor theory treatment was popular until the th century the s when cells were discovered,simple
by this time people had realized that cancer can happen anywhere in the body,simple
the oldest known document that talks about cancer was discovered in egypt and is thought to be from about b,simple
c,simple
the document talks about using surgery to treat eight cases of ulcers of the breast,simple
these were treated by cauterization - by burning them - using a tool called the fire drill,simple
the document also says about cancer there is no treatment,simple
another very early type of surgery used to treat cancer was written about in the s,simple
in the canon of medicine avicenna ibn sina said that treatment should involve cutting out all diseased tissue,simple
this included the use of amputation removing a part of the body completely or removing veins that ran in the direction of the tumor,simple
avicenna also suggested that the area that had been treated should be cauterized or burned if needed,simple
in the th and th centuries the s and s doctors started to be allowed to dissect bodies or cut them open after death in order to figure out the cause of death,simple
around this time there were many different ideas about what caused cancer,simple
the german professor wilhelm fabry believed that breast cancer was caused by a clot of milk in the part of a woman 's breast that produces milk,simple
the dutch professor francois de la boe sylvius believed that all disease was caused by chemical processes,simple
he thought that cancer in particular was caused by acidic lymph,simple
nicolaes tulp who lived at the same time as sylvius believed that cancer was a poison that slowly spreads and was contagious,simple
a british surgeon named percivall pott was the first person to figure out one of the real causes of cancer,simple
in he discovered that cancer of the scrotum was a common disease among chimney sweeps people who cleaned out chimneys,simple
other doctors started studying this topic and coming up with other ideas about what causes cancer,simple
doctors then started working together and coming up with better ideas,simple
in the th century the s many people started to use the microscope and this made a big difference in helping doctors and scientists understand more about cancer,simple
using the microscope scientists were able to see that the 'cancer poison ' spread from one tumor through the lymph nodes to other sites metastasis,simple
this was first made clear by the english surgeon campbell de morgan between and,simple
before the th century the s using surgery to treat cancer usually had bad results,simple
doctors did not understand how important hygiene or keeping things clean is for preventing disease especially after surgery,simple
because things were not kept clean during or after surgery patients often got infections and died,simple
for example one well-known scottish surgeon alexander monro kept records and found that patients out of every who had surgery for breast tumors died within the next two years,simple
in the th century surgical hygiene got better because of asepsis,simple
doctors realized that dirtiness and germs cause infections so they started to keep things cleaner and do things to kill germs in order to prevent their patients from getting infections,simple
it became more common for people to survive after having surgery,simple
surgical removal of the tumor taking the tumor out of the body by doing surgery became the first-choice treatment for cancer,simple
for this kind of treatment to work the surgeon doing the operation had to be very good at removing tumors,simple
this meant that even if people had the same kind of cancer they could get very different results with some getting good treatment that worked and others getting treatment that did not work because of differences in how good different surgeons were,simple
in the late s doctors and scientists started to realize that the body is made up of many kinds of tissues which in turn are made up of millions of cells,simple
the discovery started the age of cellular pathology studying cells to learn about diseases and figure out what is wrong with the body,simple
in the s french scientists discovered radioactive decay,simple
radiation therapy became the first cancer treatment that worked and did not involve surgery,simple
it required a new multi-disciplinary approach to cancer treatment people doing different jobs were working together to treat patients,simple
the surgeon was no longer working by himself - he worked together with hospital radiologists people who gave and read x-rays to help patients,simple
this team approach meant changes in how they worked,simple
the different people on the team had to communicate with each other and work together which they were not used to doing,simple
it also meant that treatment had to be done in a hospital rather than at the patient 's home,simple
because of this patients ' information had to be put together into files kept at the hospital called medical records,simple
because this information was now being kept and written down scientists were able to do the first statistical patient studies using numbers to study questions like how many people who have a certain type of cancer or get a certain treatment survive,simple
another important step forward in understanding cancer happened in when janet lane-claypon published a paper on cancer epidemiology,simple
epidemiology is a field of study which looks at how common a disease is what patterns the disease takes in different kinds of people and what this means for understanding and treating the disease,simple
this historic paper was a comparative study which tries to find out what causes a disease by looking at a group of people who have the disease and figuring out how they are different from another group that does not have the disease,simple
lane-clayton 's study looked at people who all had the same background and lifestyle or way of living : people with breast cancer and control patients people without breast cancer,simple
these people were the same in many ways but some got breast cancer and some did not,simple
to figure out what might be causing certain people to get breast cancer the study looked at what was different about these people when they were compared to or looked at alongside the people who did not get cancer,simple
lane-clayton 's study was published by the british ministry of health,simple
her work on cancer epidemiology was continued by richard doll and austin bradford hill,simple
they used the same ways of studying cancer as lane-clayton but they looked at a different kind of cancer : lung cancer,simple
in they published their results in a paper called lung cancer and other causes of death in relation to smoking,simple
a second report on the mortality of british doctors also called the british doctors study,simple
later richard doll left the london medical research center mrc and started the oxford unit for cancer epidemiology in,simple
by using computers this unit was able to do something new and very important : it brought together large amounts of cancer data pieces of information about cancer,simple
this way of studying cancer is very important to cancer epidemiology today and it has also been very important in shaping what we now know about cancer and what the rules and laws about the disease and public health are today,simple
over the past years many different people have done a lot of work to collect data from different doctors hospitals areas states and even countries,simple
this data is used to study whether different kinds of cancer are more or less common in different areas environments for example in big cities compared to the countryside or cultures,simple
this helps people who study cancer to figure out what makes people more or less likely to get different kinds of cancer,simple
before world war ii doctors and hospitals were getting better at collecting or getting and keeping data about their patients who had cancer but it was rare for this data to be shared with other doctors or hospitals,simple
this changed after wwii when medical research centers found out that different countries had very different number of cases of cancer,simple
because of this many countries created national public health organizations which studied public health issues in an entire country,simple
these national public health organizations began to bring together health data from many different doctors and hospitals,simple
this helped them figure out some of the reasons why cancer was so much more common in certain places,simple
for example in japan people studying cancer found out that people who had survived the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki had bone marrow that was completely destroyed,simple
this helped them realize that diseased bone marrow could also be destroyed with radiation which was a very important step in figuring out that leukemia a blood cancer can be treated with bone marrow transplants,simple
since world war ii scientists have kept finding better cancer treatments,simple
however there are some things that still need to get better,simple
for example while there are good treatments for many kinds of cancer there are still no treatments for certain kinds of cancer or for some cancers once they progress or get worse to a certain stage of the disease,simple
also the cancer treatments that do exist are not all standardized there is not one agreed-upon way of giving every treatment which is used each time the treatment is given,simple
cancer treatments are also not available everywhere in the world,simple
people need to keep studying cancer epidemiology and forming international partnerships where different countries work together to find cures and make cancer treatments available everywhere,simple
there are several species kinds of plasmodium that cause malaria in humans : serious disease : plasmodium falciparum milder disease : plasmodium malariae plasmodium ovale plasmodium vivax species which normally infect other primates : plasmodium knoweslip,simple
vivax and p,simple
falciparum cause the most malaria in people,simple
falciparum malaria is the worst kind and kills the most people,simple
when plasmodium enters the blood they are then called sporozoites,simple
sporozoites go to the liver where they make many more sporozoites,simple
then they change into a different form of plasmodium,simple
this form is the merozoite,simple
the merozoites go into the red blood cells then they make many more merozoites,simple
the merozoites break out of the red blood cells again and again,simple
when they do this the person gets very sick and shows symptoms of malaria,simple
this happens every few days and is called a paroxysm,simple
p,simple
vivax and p,simple
ovale can live in the liver for a long time,simple
a person can look well but still have the plasmodium in the liver,simple
this is called a dormant phase,simple
weeks or months later the plasmodium can leave the liver to the blood and the person will get sick again,simple
p,simple
falciparum is the most dangerous type of malaria,simple
it makes people sicker than those with other types of malaria because there are more of them in the blood,simple
also with falciparum malaria the red blood cells are sticky,simple
this makes the red blood cells block blood vessels,simple
if blood vessels are blocked this can hurt what the blood vessel brings blood to and can hurt people 's organs,simple
pregnant women and children are hurt most by malaria,simple
when they get malaria they get sicker,simple
of people live in a place where there is malaria,simple
malaria is in these places : africa asia mostly in india the middle east and southeast asia central and south america hispaniola eastern europe south pacific the part of the pacific ocean south of the equatorevery year to million people get malaria,simple
it kills million to million people every year,simple
of the deaths occur in africa,simple
most of the people who die from malaria are children,simple
even if children do not die many have brain damage,simple
many of these deaths might be stopped with medicine or mosquito control,simple
but many of the places malaria may be found are in poor countries,simple
these countries do not have enough money to stop the mosquitoes or to give people medicine,simple
money however is not the only problem,simple
a country must have an organised medical system to provide services,simple
many countries in central africa have been disrupted by warfare and conflict between groups and general unrest,simple
also easy solutions to kill the parasites do not exist as they did years ago,simple
this is because the insects are resistant to many insecticides and the plasmodium parasite is highly resistant to quinine and most other common drugs,simple
this is a normal evolutionary process : the chemicals weed out the non-resistant organisms and the offspring of the few resistant organisms multiply,simple
symptoms are changes in someone 's body that are signs for a disease,simple
most people who get malaria get symptoms – days after they get infected the plasmodium gets in their blood,simple
but some people can get symptoms after only a week and some may be infected with malaria and not have symptoms for a year,simple
the most common symptom of malaria is fever when the body temperature is high,simple
the fever from malaria usually comes very suddenly,simple
the people who have malaria often feel like they had influenza,simple
symptoms of malaria are : arthralgia pain in joints headache pain in head feeling very tired or sleepy cough chills feeling very cold delirium when people are very confused because of a disease,simple
they may look drunk,simple
they may not be able to talk,simple
coma when people are not conscious,simple
they look like they are asleep but they can not be woken,simple
signs of malaria : anemia low red blood cell levels in the blood diarrhea jaundice yellow skin and eyes sweating vomiting fast heart rate low blood pressure enlarged organs,simple
when something becomes enlarged or bigger than normal the word often ends in -megaly,simple
hepatomegaly -enlarged liver splenomegaly - enlarged spleen or both hepatosplenomegaly,simple
when these organs become enlarged it may cause pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen,simple
complications are problems that happen because of a disease,simple
pregnant women and young children have more complications,simple
people who get malaria for the first time have more complications,simple
falciparum malaria has the most complications,simple
,simple
a clinical diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms of a disease it is a diagnosis made without medical testing,simple
in the case of malaria one of the main symptoms which may lead to a clinical diagnosis of malaria is a fever,simple
any clinical diagnosis of malaria should be confirmed by a trained professional based upon laboratory results as soon as it is possible,simple
a malaria rapid diagnostic test is a blood test which can confirm a diagnosis of malaria in about twenty minutes,simple
rdts are not foolproof and have a number of drawbacks and as such a negative rapid diagnostic test should not be accepted at face-value and follow-up with malaria microscopy is necessary,simple
to see if patients have malaria doctors may do a blood test,simple
this test is called a giemsa blood smear,simple
blood is put on a slide which is a thin piece of glass,simple
the giemsa stain is put on the slide,simple
this stain helps doctors see the malaria,simple
then they look at the slide under a microscope,simple
the plasmodium is seen in the red blood cells,simple
people with different kinds of malaria need different medicines,simple
the medicine that works for one kind of malaria may not for another kind,simple
so it is very important to know which species of plasmodium the person has,simple
if the species is not known the person should be given medicine and care like they have falciparum malaria – the worst kind,simple
it is also important to know where the person got malaria,simple
plasmodium in some places is resistant to some medicines,simple
so the medicines to treat malaria in africa are different from the medicines to treat malaria from south america,simple
everywhere except new guinea the treatment is the same,simple
in new guinea most p,simple
vivax is resistant to chloroquine,simple
it can be treated with quinine but this medicine can make people sick,simple
everywhere else non-falciparum malaria is treated with chloroquine,simple
chloroquine kills the plasmodium in the blood,simple
but the plasmodium in the liver is not killed by chloroquine,simple
p,simple
vivax and p,simple
ovale both stay in the liver a long time,simple
this is the dormant phase,simple
another medicine must be given with chloroquine for p,simple
vivax and p,simple
ovale,simple
this is to kill the plasmodium in the liver,simple
the medicine used to kill malaria in the liver is primaquine,simple
in southeast asia some p,simple
vivax is resistant to primaquine,simple
most other places primaquine works very well,simple
some people get very sick from primaquine,simple
so people have to be tested to see if they have gpd-deficiency before they take primaquine,simple
falciparum is the worst kind of malaria,simple
people with falciparum malaria should be treated in a hospital if they are : very sick children pregnant having malaria for the first time not able to take medicines by moutheven people who are treated with medicines at home should stay with the doctor for hours,simple
this is to make sure they do not get sicker,simple
it also makes sure they can take the medicines by mouth,simple
malaria does not start to become a life-threatening disease until it has been a couple of weeks after the bite without being treated,simple
falciparum malaria also has more resistance to medicines,simple
this makes it much harder to treat,simple
falciparum malaria is always treated with two or more medicines,simple
doctors choose the medicines by where in the world the person got malaria,simple
different places have p,simple
falciparum that is resistant to different medicines,simple
the most important resistance is chloroquine-resistance,simple
in some places in the world p,simple
falciparum is killed by chloroquine,simple
in some places it is chloroquine-resistant,simple
this means chloroquine does not kill it,simple
in these places quinine can be used,simple
quinine is taken by mouth,simple
there are three ways to prevent malaria : control mosquitoes keep mosquitoes from biting take medicine to keep from getting sick after a bite especially in those parts of the world where people get malaria,simple
vector control is one way to stop malaria,simple
vector means an organism that carries an infectious disease to another organism,simple
for malaria the vector is the anopheles mosquito,simple
the most used method of vector control is pesticides,simple
these are chemicals that kill the mosquito,simple
the first pesticide used for vector control was ddt,simple
ddt worked very well for vector control,simple
it killed mosquitoes,simple
it did not make people very sick at the time it was used,simple
it did not cost very much money,simple
other chemicals for vector control had not been invented yet,simple
in many places mosquitoes became resistant to ddt,simple
this meant that ddt did not work anymore in these areas,simple
scientists worried that ddt was making people and animals sick,simple
it killed a lot of wildlife too,simple
ddt also stays in the environment for a long time,simple
for these reasons people mostly use other chemicals for vector control,simple
organophosphate or carbonate pesticides are used like malathion or bendiocarb,simple
vector control is not the only way to stop malaria,simple
and ddt is not the only chemical that can be used for vector control,simple
the best way to stop malaria is to use a combination of methods,simple
in some places ddt may be a useful part of a program to stop malaria,simple
this is why ddt is still allowed to be used for controlling malaria,simple
the mosquito that carries malaria comes more at dawn when the sun comes up and dusk when the sun goes down,simple
be most careful at these times,simple
wear long trousers and shirts with long sleeves,simple
wear mosquito repellent this is a chemical that mosquitoes do not like so they do not bite,simple
mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth,simple
so repellent should be used on skin and clothes,simple
pesticides can be used in rooms to kill mosquitoes,simple
when sleeping outside people use a mosquito net,simple
this is made from cloth that air can go through but keeps mosquitoes out,simple
it is put over a bed where people sleep to keep mosquitoes out,simple
sometimes people also use it when they are not sleeping,simple
it is best to use mosquito nets that have been treated with permethrin which repels and kills mosquitoes,simple
people can take medicine when they are in a place where there is malaria,simple
this reduces the chances that they contract malaria,simple
this is called prophylaxis,simple
some people take prophylactic medicines for years,simple
many people in areas where there is malaria do not have the money to buy this medicine,simple
people who live where there is no malaria usually have not had malaria,simple
the first case malaria is usually much worse,simple
so people from places where there is no malaria may take prophylactic medicines when they go to places where there is malaria,simple
the kind of prophylactic medicines people take depends on where they are,simple
this is because not all medicines work on the malaria in every place,simple
to make them work best prophylactic medicines have to be taken the right way,simple
the medicine should start before going to an area with malaria,simple
most medicines should be taken for weeks after coming home,simple
one medicine malarone only needs to be used for one week after coming home,simple
there are some children in tanzania who are naturally immune to malaria,simple
researchers are using this to develop a new vaccine,simple
u,simple
researchers have found the children produce an antibody which attacks the malaria-causing parasite,simple
injecting a form of this antibody into mice protected the animals from the disease,simple
the researchers plan to do tests on primates including humans,simple
it was britain 's sir ronald ross working in the presidency general hospital in the kolkata who finally proved in that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes,simple
he did this by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds,simple
he isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds,simple
for this work ross received the nobel prize in medicine,simple
after resigning from the indian medical service ross worked at the newly established liverpool school of tropical medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in egypt panama greece and mauritius,simple
the findings of finlay and ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by walter reed in,simple
its recommendations were used during construction of the panama canal,simple
this public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease,simple
the first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree which contains quinine,simple
this tree grows on the slopes of the andes mainly in peru,simple
the indigenous peoples of peru made a tincture of cinchona to control malaria,simple
the jesuits noted the efficacy of the practice and introduced the treatment to europe during the s where it was rapidly accepted,simple
it was not until that the active ingredient quinine was extracted from the bark isolated and named by french chemists,simple
in the early th century before antibiotics became available julius wagner-jauregg discovered that patients with syphilis could be treated by intentionally infecting them with malaria,simple
the resulting fever would kill the syphilis spirochaetes and quinine could be administered to control the malaria,simple
although some patients died from malaria this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis,simple
malaria was the largest hazard encountered by u,simple
troops in the south pacific during world war ii where about men were infected,simple
sixty thousand american soldiers died of malaria during the north african and south pacific campaigns,simple
plasmodium antibiotic resistance,simple
physical fitness refers to good body health,simple
it is dependent on genetic determinators and also on social economic and ecological factors,simple
that means one´s genes are partly responsible for one´s physical health but also other circumstances : where you live how clean or polluted your water and the air around you is and also how good your social and medical system is,simple
it is also the result of regular exercise proper diet and nutrition and proper rest for physical recovery,simple
a person who is physically fit will be able to walk or run without getting breathless and they will be able to carry out the activities of everyday living and not need help,simple
how much each person can do will depend on their age and whether they are a man or woman,simple
a physically fit person usually has a normal weight for their height,simple
the relation between their height and weight is called their body mass index,simple
a taller person can be heavier and still be fit,simple
if a person is too heavy or too thin for their height it may affect their health,simple
mental health refers to a person 's emotional and psychological well-being,simple
a state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional feeling abilities function in society and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life,simple
one way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person functions,simple
feeling capable and efficient being able to handle normal levels of stress have good friends and family and lead an independent life and being able to bounce back or recover from hardships are all signs of mental health,simple
public health refers to trying to stop a disease that is unhealthy to the community and does not help in long life or promote your health,simple
this is fixed by organized efforts and choices of society public and private clubs communities and individuals,simple
it is about the health of many people or everybody rather than one person,simple
public health stops instead of encouraging a disease through surveillance of cases,simple
to prevent being sick it is good to act according to some simple advice : hand washing regular check-ups vaccination programmes drinking clean water and using condoms,simple
when infectious diseases break out washing hands for about seconds may be especially important,simple
sometimes it is necessary to avoid masses of people or wear a surgical mask to protect yourself and to stop the spreading of the disease,simple
teaching people how to live healthily and educate them especially about sex and child-birth is also very important,simple

insects have exoskeletons skeletons on the outside,simple
their skeletons are made out of thin hard pieces or plates like armour made of chitin,simple
all together these pieces make a hard layer around the insect ’ s body,simple
the exoskeleton protects the insect,simple
the body of an insect has three main parts : a head a thorax and an abdomen,simple
on the head are an insect ’ s compound eyes its two antennae they feel and smell things and its mouth,simple
on the thorax insects have wings and legs,simple
all insects have six legs three pairs of jointed legs and usually four wings two pairs,simple
the abdomen is the back part of the insect,simple
inside the abdomen is the stomach the heart and the excretory system where body wastes pass out of the insect,simple
bees also have a stinger at the back of the abdomen,simple
just like our muscles connect to our bones to make us walk and stand up the muscles of an insect connect to the exoskeleton to make it walk and move,simple
their muscles are on the inside of their skeleton,simple
insects are cold-blooded which means that they can not control their body temperature,simple
this means that insects are not good at surviving the cold at any rate out in the open,simple
in the winter many insects go into something called diapause which is the insect version of hibernation,simple
some insects like cockroaches can not go into diapause and they will die if it gets too cold outside,simple
this is why cockroaches love living in people 's warm houses,simple
insect respiration happens without lungs,simple
there is a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases diffuse or are actively pumped,simple
air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called spiracles,simple
oxygen gets to tissues that need it through their trachea element in diagram,simple
many insect larvae live in water,simple
many of those have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water,simple
others must rise to the water surface to get air which may be held or trapped in special parts of their body,simple
adult insects use oxygen at a high rate when they fly,simple
they need it for the flight muscles the most active tissue known in biology,simple
the flight muscles use oxygen at a huge rate : ccs of oxygen for every single cc of tissue per hour,simple
with this system the greatest diameter a muscle could have and still consume oxygen at this rate is about,simple
cm,simple
even with special extra arrangements insects can not get larger than about cm long,simple
the largest insect bodies are about as big as a mouse,simple
some insects also use a molecule called haemocyanin which does the same job as haemoglobin does in vertebrates but less efficiently,simple
the insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries,simple
the 'blood ' is called haemolymph and moves around in the space called the haemocoel,simple
the organs sit in the haemocoel and are bathed in the haemolymph,simple
the 'heart ' is little more than a single tube which pulses squeezes,simple
insects start life as an egg,simple
usually a female mother insect lays eggs but a few species have live birth the eggs develop inside the mother,simple
the eggs are small but they can usually be seen with the naked eye,simple
although the adults are larger they do need a magnifying glass or a binocular microscope to see the details,simple
a professional entomologist uses a binocular microscope to identify insects plus a printed reference work,simple
there are far too many insects for anyone to remember them all and most entomologists specialise in just one or two orders,simple
after the eggs hatch two kinds of development may occur,simple
some insects have what is called 'incomplete metamorphosis ',simple
this means that a small insect called a nymph comes out of the egg and the nymph looks almost the same as the adult insect,simple
as the nymph grows it does not change the way it looks but only how big it is,simple
it goes through a number of stages called 'instars ',simple
grasshoppers grow in this way,simple
other insects have complete metamorphosis which means that the small larva which comes out of the egg looks very different from the adult insect,simple
insects that have complete metamorphosis usually come out of the egg as a larva which usually looks like a worm,simple
the larva eats food and gets bigger until it turns into a pupa,simple
butterfly pupae plural for pupa are often inside cocoons,simple
inside the cocoon the insect changes the way it looks and often grows wings,simple
when the cocoon opens the adult insect comes out,simple
many insects have complete metamorphosis for example beetles butterflies and moths and flies,simple
the adult stage of development is called the imago,simple
,simple
the oldest known insect fossil is the devonian rhyniognatha from the million year old rhynie chert,simple
it may have superficially resembled a modern-day silverfish insect,simple
this species already possessed mandibles of a type associated with winged insects suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time,simple
thus the first insects probably appeared earlier in the silurian period,simple
in researchers uncovered what they believe is the world 's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect a million-year-old specimen from the carboniferous period,simple
the origins of insect flight remain obscure since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers,simple
some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax for a total of three pairs,simple
it seems the insects were not a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved wings,simple
upper carboniferous and lower permian insect orders include both living groups and a number of palaeozoic groups now extinct,simple
during this era some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of to cm to in making them far larger than any living insect,simple
this gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels which allowed increased respiratory efficiency,simple
the lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor,simple
many of the early groups became extinct during the permian-triassic extinction event the largest mass extinction in the history of the earth around million years ago,simple
different kinds of insects can be divided into groups called orders,simple
there are many insect orders,simple
the biggest insect orders are listed below : beetles order coleoptera have the front pair of wings changed into a hard shell to protect the back wings,simple
butterflies and moths order lepidoptera have large often colourful wings,simple
flies order diptera have only two wings,simple
ants bees and wasps order hymenoptera sometimes have stingers and sometimes live in large colonies like ant hills,simple
true bugs order hemiptera have a mouth that is long and narrow like a drinking straw,simple
this kind of mouth is called a beak,simple
grasshoppers order orthoptera can usually jump with their legs,simple
eat grass and grain plants,simple
odonata dragonflies and damselflies are top predators of other insects,simple
both aquatic nymphs and flying adults are carnivorous,simple
phasmatodea the stick and leaf insects is an order which is entirely based on camouflage,simple
it includes the world 's longest insect chan 's megastick,simple
spiders scorpions and similar animals are not insects they are arachnids,simple
arachnids are arthropods that have four pairs of legs,simple
centipedes are also arthropods but not insects : they are in a subphylum called the myriapoda,simple
this taxonomy lists some of the better known groups of insects,simple
archaeognatha jumping bristletails thysanura silverfish or bristletails palaeoptera insects that can not flex their wings over their abdomen ephemeroptera mayflies odonata anisoptera dragonflies zygoptera damselflies neoptera insects that can flex their wings over their abdomen exopterygota sensu stricto caloneurodea extinct titanoptera extinct protorthoptera extinct plecoptera stone flies about species embioptera webspinners about species orthoptera grasshoppers crickets and locusts zoraptera one genus about species resemble termites dermaptera earwigs dictyoptera notoptera tentative grylloblattidae ice crawlers mantophasmatidae discovered in gladiators phasmatodea stick insects about species tentative blattaria cockroaches isoptera termites mantodea mantids parapneuroptera psocoptera booklice thysanoptera thrips phthiraptera lice hemiptera true bugs,simple
species endopterygota or holometabola living species in eleven orders hymenoptera ants bees wasps sawflies coleoptera beetles strepsiptera parasites that mostly live inside other insects raphidioptera snakeflies megaloptera neuroptera net-winged insects contains antlions for example mecoptera scorpionflies may include fleas siphonaptera fleas diptera true flies trichoptera moth-like lepidoptera moths and butterflies,simple
pests can be harmful to people in different ways,simple
some are parasites such as lice and bed bugs,simple
some of these parasite insects can spread diseases such as mosquitoes spreading malaria,simple
other pest insects do not directly hurt people,simple
termites and some beetles eat wood and sometimes eat buildings such as houses,simple
however termites also help break down the trees and branches that fall on the forest floor,simple
many insects eat agricultural products plants meant for people to eat,simple
grasshoppers are one example of pest insects that eat plants in agriculture,simple
some insects are useful to us,simple
bees make honey,simple
the larvae of some moths make silk which people use to make clothing,simple
in some parts of the world people actually eat insects,simple
eating insects for food is called entomophagy,simple
many bees and flies pollinate plants,simple
this means the insects help the plants make seeds by moving pollen from one flower to another,simple
some good insects eat pest insects such as lady beetles or ladybirds or ladybugs eating aphids,simple
many insects eat dead plants and animals,simple
people often use poisons called insecticides to kill pest insects,simple
insecticides do not always work,simple
sometimes the pest insects become resistant to the insecticides which means the insecticides do not hurt them anymore,simple
both the colorado potato beetle and the diamondback moth are insects that are resistant to many insecticides,simple
insecticides do not only kill pest insects sometimes many helpful insects are killed too,simple
when helpful insects are killed such as those that eat pest insects the pest insects may come back in larger numbers than before because they are not being eaten by helpful insects anymore,simple
birds come in a huge range of colours,simple
these colours can be useful to a bird in two ways,simple
camouflage colours help to hide the bird and bright colours identify the bird to others of the same species,simple
often the male is brightly coloured while the female is camouflaged,simple
many birds are brown green or grey,simple
these colours make a bird harder to see they camouflage the bird,simple
brown is the most common colour,simple
brown birds include sparrows emus thrushes larks eagles falcons and the female birds of many species such as wrens ducks blackbirds and peacocks,simple
when a brown bird is in long grass or among tree trunks or rocks it is camouflaged,simple
birds that live in long grass often have brown feathers streaked with black which looks like shadows,simple
a bittern is almost invisible in long reeds,simple
other birds including starlings and minahs are quite dark in colour but are flecked with little spots that look like raindrops on leaves,simple
many birds from hot countries are green or have some green feathers particularly parrots,simple
birds that live in green trees often have green backs even if they have bright-coloured breasts,simple
from the back the birds are camouflaged,simple
this is very useful when sitting on a nest,simple
the bird 's bright-coloured breast is hidden,simple
budgerigars are bred in different colours such as blue white and mauve but in the wild they are nearly all green and yellow,simple
even though they fly very well they normally spend a lot of time on the ground eating grass seeds,simple
their yellow and black striped back helps to hide them in the shadows made by long dry grass while their green breasts are a similar colour to the leaves of gum trees,simple
grey birds include most pigeons and doves cranes storks and herons,simple
grey birds are often rock-living birds like pigeons or birds that sit on dead tree trunks looking like a broken branch,simple
water birds like herons often have a pale grey colour which makes it harder for a fish to notice that the bird is standing looking down for something to catch,simple
water birds no matter what colour they are on top are often white underneath so that when a fish looks up the bird looks like part of the sky,simple
black birds include crows ravens and male blackbirds,simple
some birds that are dark colours spend quite a lot of time on the ground hopping around in the shadows under bushes,simple
among these birds are the male blackbird and the satin bowerbird which is not black but very dark blue,simple
crows and ravens often perch high on bare trees in the winter where their black shape against the sky looks like the dark bare branches,simple
many birds are not camouflaged but stand out with vivid colours,simple
they are usually male birds whose females are dull and camouflaged,simple
the function of the colours is two-fold,simple
first the colours help them get mates and second the colours identify them to other males of the same species,simple
many birds are territorial especially in the nesting season,simple
they give out territory sounds and are easily seen,simple
this lets other males know they will defend their territory,simple
it sends out a look elsewhere signal to their competitors,simple
some birds are famous for their colour and are named for it such as the bluebird the azure kingfisher the golden pheasant the scarlet macaw the violet wren and the robin,simple
many other birds are very brightly coloured in countless combinations,simple
some of the most colourful birds are quite common like pheasants peacocks domestic fowl and parrots,simple
colourful small birds include blue tits the gold finches humming birds fairy wrens and bee eaters which are also called rainbow birds,simple
some birds like those of the bird of paradise in papua new guinea have such beautiful feathers that they have been hunted for them,simple
the peafowl is the best example of a display of colour to attract a mate,simple
also the male domestic fowl and junglefowl have long shiny feathers above his tail and also long neck feathers that may be a different colour to his wings and body,simple
there are only a very few types of birds like the eclectus parrot where the female is more colourful than the male,simple
'pied birds ' are black and white,simple
black and white birds include magpies pied geese pelicans and australian magpies which are not really magpies at all,simple
pied birds often have brightly coloured beaks and legs of yellow or red,simple
the silver pheasant with its long white tail striped with fine bars of black has a brightly coloured face,simple
most birds can fly,simple
they do this by pushing through the air with their wings,simple
the curved surfaces of the wings cause air currents wind which lift the bird,simple
flapping keeps the air current moving to create lift and also moves the bird forward,simple
some birds can glide on air currents without flapping,simple
many birds use this method when they are about to land,simple
some birds can also hover and remain in one place,simple
this method is used by birds of prey such as falcons that are looking for something to eat,simple
seagulls are also good at hovering particularly if there is a strong breeze,simple
the most expert hovering birds are tiny hummingbirds which can beat their wings both backwards and forwards and can stay quite still in the air while they dip their long beaks into flowers to feed on the sweet nectar,simple
different types of birds have different needs,simple
their wings are adapted to suit the way they fly,simple
large birds of prey such as eagles that spend a lot of time soaring on the wind have wings that are large and broad,simple
the main flight feathers are long and wide,simple
they help the eagle to stay on rising air currents without using much energy while the eagle looks at the ground below to find the next meal,simple
when the eagle sees some small creature move it can close its wings and fall from the sky like a missile opening its great wings again to slow down as it comes to land,simple
the world 's largest eagle the philippine eagle has a wingspan of about metres,simple
ft wide,simple
birds that live in grassland areas or open forests and feed on fruit insects and reptiles often spend a lot of time flying short journeys looking for food and water,simple
they have wings that are shaped in a similar way to eagles but rounder and not as good for soaring,simple
these include many australian birds like cockatoos,simple
birds such as geese that migrate from one country to another fly very long distances,simple
their wings are big and strong because the birds are large and they stock up on food for the long flight,simple
migrating water birds usually form family groups of - birds,simple
they fly very high making use of long streams of air that blow from north to south in different seasons,simple
they are very well organised often flying in a v pattern,simple
the geese at the back do not have to flap so hard they are pulled on by the wind of the ones at the front,simple
every so often they change the leader so that the front bird who does most work and sets the pace can have a rest,simple
geese and swans are the highest-flying birds reaching metres or more when on migration,simple
geese often honk loudly while they are flying,simple
it is thought that they do this to support the leader and help the young ones,simple
birds that fly very quickly such as swifts and swallows have long narrow pointed wings,simple
these birds need great speed because they eat insects catching most of them while they are flying,simple
these birds also migrate,simple
they often collect in huge flocks of thousands of birds that move together like a whirling cloud,simple
birds that live in bushes and branches have triangular wings that help the bird change direction,simple
many forest birds are expert at getting up speed by flapping and then gliding steadily among the trees tilting to avoid things as they go,simple
members of the kingfisher family are expert at this type of flying,simple
birds such as owls that hunt at night have wings with soft rounded feathers so that they do not flap loudly,simple
birds that are awake at night are called nocturnal birds,simple
birds that are awake during the day are diurnal,simple
a wandering albatross and arctic tern might spend several years without coming to land,simple
they can sleep while gliding and have wings which when they are stretched right out look like the wings of a jet plane,simple
bird like chickens that feed mainly on the ground and only use their wings to fly to safety have small wings,simple
flocks of birds can be very highly organised in a way that takes care of all the flock members,simple
studies of small flocking birds like tree sparrows show that they clearly communicate with each other as sometimes thousands of birds may fly in close formation and spiral patterns without colliding or flying into each other,simple
two common behaviours in flocking birds are guarding and reconnaissance,simple
when a flock of birds is feeding it is common for one bird to perch on a high place to keep guard over the flock,simple
in the same way when a flock is asleep often one bird will remain awake,simple
it is also common for large flocks to send one or two birds ahead of them when they are flying to a new area,simple
the look-out birds can spy the lie of the land to find food water and good places to perch,simple
some birds do not fly,simple
these include running birds like ostriches and emus and ocean-living birds the large penguin family,simple
ostriches and emus do not need to fly because although they feed and nest on the ground their great size and their speed is their protection,simple
some other ground-feeding birds have not been so lucky,simple
some birds such as the dodo and the kiwi were ground-feeding birds that lived in safety on islands where there was nothing dangerous to eat them,simple
they lost the power of flight,simple
kiwis are endangered because european settlement to new zealand brought animals like cats dogs and rats which kill kiwis and eat their eggs,simple
however kiwis and also the rare new zealand ground parrot have survived,simple
in the case of dodos they were fat and delicious,simple
they were killed and eaten by sailors until there was none left,simple
other flightless birds which have disappeared are the great auk and the moa,simple
penguins spend a great deal of time at sea where they are in danger from seals,simple
on land they usually live in areas where there were few dangers until the arrival of european settlers with dogs and cats,simple
their wings have adapted to life in the sea and have become flippers which help them in swimming very fast,simple
modern birds do not have teeth but they must nevertheless break up food before it is digested,simple
first of all along their throat oesophagus they have a crop,simple
this stores food items before digestion,simple
that way a bird can eat several items and then fly off to a quiet spot to digest them,simple
their stomach comes next with two very different parts,simple
one part is like a straight hollow rod which secretes mild hydrochloric acid and an enzyme to break down protein,simple
the other part of the stomach is the gizzard,simple
this is muscular and grinds up the contents,simple
in herbivorous birds the gizzard contains some gastroliths small stones or pieces of grit,simple
bones of fish will mostly be dissolved by the stomach acid,simple
the partly digested and ground-up food now goes to the intestine where digestion is completed and then most contents are absorbed,simple
anything indigestible for example remains of feathers is regurgitated via the mouth not the cloaca,simple
the system is effective and carnivorous birds can swallow quite large prey,simple
a blue heron can swallow a fish as large as a carp successfully,simple
raptors eat by holding the prey down and tearing it apart with their beak,simple
,simple
although birds are warm-blooded creatures like mammals they do not give birth to live young,simple
they lay eggs as reptiles do but the shell of a bird 's egg is hard,simple
the baby bird grows inside the egg and after a few weeks hatches breaks out of the egg,simple
birds in cold climates usually have a breeding season once a year in the spring,simple
migratory birds can have two springs and two mating seasons in a year,simple
so can birds that live in hot climates,simple
when the breeding season arrives the birds choose partners,simple
some birds are mated for life like married couples,simple
these birds include pigeons geese and cranes,simple
other birds look for new partners each year and sometimes a male bird or cock will have several wives,simple
for birds that choose new mates part of the breeding season is display,simple
the male bird will do all sorts of things to attract females,simple
these include singing dancing showing off the feathers and building a beautiful nest,simple
some male birds have splendid feathers for attracting females,simple
the most famous is the peacock who can spread the feathers above his tail into a huge fan,simple
once the birds have found partners they find a suitable place to lay eggs,simple
the idea of what is a suitable place differs between species but most build bird nests,simple
robins will make a beautiful little round nest of woven grass and carefully line it with feathers bits of fluff and other soft things,simple
swallows like to nest near other swallows,simple
they make nests from little blobs of clay often on a beam near the roof of a building where it is well sheltered,simple
many birds like a hollow tree to nest in,simple
eagle 's nests are often just piles of dead wood on the top of the tallest tree or mountain,simple
scrub turkeys scratch together a huge pile of leaves that may be metres across,simple
guillemots lay their eggs on rock shelves with no nest at all,simple
their eggs are shaped so that they roll around in circles and do not fall off cliffs,simple
a cuckoo does not make its own nest,simple
it lays its egg in the nest of another bird and leaves it for them to care for,simple
the cuckoo eggs are camouflaged to look like the host 's eggs,simple
when the nest has been prepared the birds mate so that the eggs are fertilised and the chicks will start growing,simple
unlike mammals birds only have one opening as the exit hole for body fluids and for reproduction,simple
the opening is called the cloaca,simple
a female bird called a hen has two ovaries of which the left one usually produces eggs,simple
most male birds have no sex organs that can be seen,simple
but inside the male are two testes which produce sperm which is stored in the cloaca,simple
birds mate by rubbing their cloacas together although with some birds particularly large water birds the male has a sort of a penis inside the cloaca,simple
once the hen has mated she produces fertile eggs which have chicks growing inside them,simple
she lays the eggs in the nest,simple
there might be just one egg or a number of them called a clutch,simple
emus might lay as many as fifteen huge dark green eggs in a clutch,simple
after the eggs are laid they are incubated or kept warm so the chicks form inside,simple
most birds stay together for the whole nesting season and one advantage is that the work is shared,simple
many birds take turns sitting on the eggs so that each adult can feed,simple
this is not always the case,simple
with emus the male does all the sitting and all the baby-minding,simple
with emperor penguins it is also the male that cares for the egg,simple
there is only one egg which he keeps on his feet and under his feathers standing in a big group of males without feeding until the chick is hatched,simple
while the eggs are hatching the females are at sea feeding so that they can care for the chicks when they return,simple
some birds put the eggs inside or on top of the mound of leaves and twigs,simple
the mound acts like a compost heap,simple
the decomposition of the rotting leaves causes the temperature to rise,simple
this is heat released by the chemical action of bacterial and fungal respiration,simple
it is the same reaction as that which keeps mammals and birds at a high temperature,simple
the parents leave the mound,simple
when the chicks hatch they are able to feed themselves,simple
many small birds take – weeks to hatch eggs,simple
albatrosses take days,simple
during this time the female loses a lot of her body weight,simple
the quickest hatching time is for the cuckoo,simple
some types of cuckoos take only days,simple
this means that when they hatch in the nest of their 'foster parents ' the eggs that the parents have laid are not yet ready,simple
newborn cuckoos are naked blind and ugly but they are strong,simple
they get under any eggs that are in the nest and throw them out before they hatch,simple
that means that the cuckoo has the whole care of both parents,simple
baby cuckoos grow fast and often get bigger than the parents who feed them,simple
when baby birds hatch in most types of birds they are fed by both parents and sometimes by older aunties as well,simple
their mouths are open all the time and are often very brightly coloured which acts as a 'releaser ' a trigger which stimulates the parent to feed them,simple
for birds that eat grain and fruit the parents eat and partly digest the food for the babies,simple
it is then vomitted carefully into the baby 's mouth,simple
many birds particularly those that mate for life are very sociable and keep together in a family group which might be anything from or adult birds and their young to a very large flock,simple
as chicks grow they change the fluffy down that covers them as babies for real feathers,simple
at this stage they are called fledglings,simple
other family members may help care for fledgling chicks feeding them and protecting them from attack while parents are feeding,simple
when the fledglings have their new feathers they come out of the nest to learn to fly,simple
in some types of birds like pigeons the parents watch over this and as the young ones get stronger will give them flying lessons teaching them how to glide how to fly in spirals and how to land like an expert,simple
most birds are social animals at least part of the time,simple
they communicate to each other using sounds and displays,simple
almost all birds make sounds to communicate,simple
the types of noises that vary greatly,simple
some birds can sing and they are called songbirds or passerines,simple
examples are robins larks canaries thrushes nightingales,simple
corvids are passerines but they do not sing,simple
birds that are not songbirds include pigeons seagulls eagles owls and ducks,simple
parrots are not songbirds even though they can be taught to sing human songs,simple
all birds make noises 'bird vocalisation ' but not all sing,simple
songbirds are passerines many of which have beautiful melodic songs,simple
songs have different functions,simple
danger cries are different from territorial songs and mating calls are a third type,simple
fledgling may also have different calls from adults,simple
recognition calls for partners are quite common,simple
as to where the song comes from there are three kinds of species : those where the song is entirely inherited and the bird always sings the same song in the same situations,simple
those where the song is partly inherited but the bird tunes it in by copying others,simple
in this case the slight differences between the calls of different birds may be used by partners for identification,simple
those where the song is entirely learnt and the bird often copies sounds from its environment,simple
most singing birds that are kept as pets like canaries have several tunes and some variations,simple
the same species of bird will sing different songs in different regions,simple
a good example of this is the currawong,simple
this is an australia bird which is like a black and white crow,simple
in the autumn families get together in large flocks and do a lot of singing,simple
currawongs from some areas sing much more complex songs than others,simple
generally currawongs from the blue mountains are the finest singers,simple
the song of the currawong can be sung as a solo but is often performed as a choir,simple
one bird will take the lead and sing warble-warble-warble-warble all the other birds will join in and sing wooooooo when all the birds know the song the choir will sing the warble part and the soloist will sing the woo,simple
the song changes from year to year and from place to place,simple
the austrian naturalist konrad lorenz studied the way in which birds communicate or talk to each other,simple
he found that each type of bird had a number of sounds which they made automatically when ever they felt a certain way,simple
every sound had an action that went with it,simple
so if the bird was frightened it acted frightened and made a frightened sound,simple
this told the other birds around it that something frightening was happening,simple
if a flock of birds were flying over a field they would be calling fly fly but a hungry bird seeing something good to eat down below might start calling food food if other birds were also hungry they would make the same call until more birds were calling food food than fly fly,simple
at this point the mind of the flock would be changed,simple
some of the birds would start to yell fly downwards fly downwards as they sank from the sky until the whole flock was all noisily calling the same thing,simple
these communication sounds are often short hard sounds like chirps squeaks squawks,simple
and twitters,simple
sometimes the calls are longer and more musical,simple
they include the rookety-coo sound of a pigeon and the cockadoodledoo of a rooster,simple
the bird can not change these sounds,simple
they always make them in the same way,simple
the bird is locked into making each sound every time a particular idea comes into its head,simple
the connection between how they feel and how they call is innate : they are born with it,simple
some calls in some species are learnt,simple
then it is the tendency to learn which is inherited,simple
konrad lorenz noticed that when birds sing they often use a lot of their regular calls as part of the song,simple
lorenz had a flock of jackdaws which were scattered during world war ii,simple
one day an old bird returned,simple
for many months she sat on the chimney singing her song but in the song she kept making the call which lorenz knew meant come home come home one day to the great surprise of lorenz a male bird flew from a passing flock and joined her on the chimney,simple
lorenz was sure that it was her long-lost husband who had found his way home at last,simple
palaeontologists have found some exceptional places lagerstätten where fossils of early birds are found,simple
the preservation is so good that on the best examples impressions of their feathers can be seen and sometimes even the remains of meals they have eaten,simple
from these remains we know that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs theropods in the jurassic period,simple
they radiated into a huge variety in the lower cretaceous,simple
at the same time their direct competitors the pterosaurs dwindled in numbers and variety and became extinct at the end of the mesozoic,simple
birds are classified by taxonomists as 'aves ' avialae,simple
birds are the only living descendants of dinosaurs strictly speaking they are dinosaurs,simple
birds and crocodilia are the only living members of the once-dominant archosaur reptiles,simple
the class aves is now defined as all the descendants of the most recent common ancestor of modern birds and archaeopteryx lithographica,simple
archaeopteryx from the upper jurassic some – million years ago is the earliest bird which could fly,simple
it is famous because it was one of the first important fossils found after charles darwin published his ideas about evolution in the th century,simple
by modern standards archaeopteryx could not fly very well,simple
other early fossil birds are for example confuciusornis anchiornis huxlei and other paraves,simple
many fossils of early birds and small dinosaurs have been discovered in the liaoning province of northeast china,simple
the fossils show that most small theropod dinosaurs had feathers,simple
these deposits have preserved them so well that the impressions of their feathers can be clearly seen,simple
this leads us to think that feathers evolved first as heat insulation and only later for flight,simple
the origin of birds lies in these small feathered dinosaurs,simple
palaeontologists now agree that birds evolved from maniraptora group of dinosaurs,simple
this explains why one might say birds are living dinosaurs,simple
origin of birds paraves,simple
some birds are eaten as food,simple
most usually it is the chicken and its eggs but people often also eat geese pheasants turkeys and ducks,simple
other birds are sometimes eaten are emus ostriches pigeons grouse quails doves woodcocks and even songbirds,simple
some species have died out because they have been hunted for food for example the dodo and the passenger pigeon,simple
many species have learned how to get food from people,simple
the number of birds of these species has grown because of it,simple
seagulls and crows find food from garbage dumps,simple
the feral pigeon columba livia sparrows passer domesticus and starlings sturnus vulgaris live in large numbers in towns and cities all over the world,simple
sometimes people also use working birds,simple
for example homing pigeons carry messages,simple
nowadays people sometimes race them for sport,simple
people also use falcons for hunting and cormorants for fishing,simple
in the past people in mines often used a canary to see if there were bad gas methane in the air,simple
people often have colorful birds such as parrots and mynahs as pets,simple
these intelligent birds are popular because they can copy human talking,simple
because of this some people trap birds and take them to other countries to sell,simple
this is not usually allowed these days,simple
most pet birds are specially bred and are sold in pet shops,simple
people can catch some bird diseases for example psittacosis salmonellosis campylobacteriosis newcastle 's disease mycobacteriosis influenza giardiasis and cryptosporiadiosis,simple
in there was an epidemic of bird influenza spreading through some parts of the world often called avian flu,simple
some people have birdboxes in their gardens to give birds a place to nest and bird tables where birds can get food and water in very cold or very dry weather,simple
this lets people see some small birds close up which are normally hidden away in bushes and trees,simple
a bacterium reproduces creates more bacteria by dividing in half and creating two daughter cells,simple
each daughter is identical in shape to the parent but is smaller,simple
bacteria do not have sexes but they do transmit dna by several kinds of horizontal gene transfer,simple
this is how they share resistance to antibiotics from one strain to another,simple
the complete dna sequence is known for many bacterial strains,simple
bacteria vary widely in size and shape but in general they are at least ten times larger than viruses,simple
a typical bacterium is about µm one micrometer in diameter so a thousand bacteria lined up would be one millimeter long,simple
there are about five nonillion × bacteria on earth,simple
bacteria are identified and grouped by their shapes,simple
bacilli are rod-shaped cocci are ball-shaped spirilla are spiral-shaped and vibrio are shaped like a comma or a boomerang,simple
pathogenic bacteria the harmful kind enter the human body from the air water or food,simple
once inside these bacteria attach themselves to or invade specific cells in our respiratory system digestive tract or in any open wound,simple
there they begin to reproduce and spread while using your body 's food and nutrients to give them energy to help them reproduce,simple
some bacteria are extremophiles,simple
some microbes thrive inside rocks up to meters below the sea floor under,simple
kilometers of ocean off the pacific northwest of the united states,simple
according to one of the researchers you can find microbes everywhere — they 're extremely adaptable to conditions and survive wherever they are,simple
all modern ideas start with the sequence analysis of dna and rna,simple
in carl woese the forerunner of the molecular phylogeny revolution divided bacteria into divisions based on s ribosomal rna ssu sequences : proteobacteria : purple bacteria and their relatives alpha subdivision purple non-sulfur bacteria rhizobacteria agrobacterium bartonella rickettsiae nitrobacter beta subdivision rhodocyclus some thiobacillus alcaligenes spirillum nitrosovibrio gamma subdivision enterics fluorescent pseudomonads purple sulfur bacteria legionella some beggiatoa delta subdivision sulfur and sulfate reducers desulfovibrio myxobacteria bdellovibrio gram-positive eubacteria high-gc species - actinobacteria actinomyces streptomyces arthrobacter micrococcus bifidobacterium low-gc species - firmicutes clostridium peptococcus bacillus mycoplasma photosynthetic species heliobacterium species with gram-negative walls megasphaera sporomusa cyanobacteria and chloroplasts aphanocapsa oscillatoria nostoc synechococcus gleoebacter prochloron spirochaetes and relatives spirochetes spirochaeta treponema borrelia leptospiras leptospira leptonema green sulfur bacteria chlorobium chloroherpeton bacteroides flavobacteria and relatives bacteroides bacteroides fusobacterium flavobacterium group flavobacterium cytophaga saprospira flexibacter planctomyces and relatives planctomyces group planctomyces pasteuria thermophiles isocystis pallida chlamydiae chlamydia psittaci chlamydia trachomatis radioresistant micrococci and relatives deinococcus group deinococcus radiodurans thermophiles thermus aquaticus green non-sulfur bacteria and relatives chloroflexus group chloroflexus herpetosiphon thermomicrobium group thermomicrobium roseum thermotogae,simple

fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually,simple
some fungi grow mushrooms : these are fruiting bodies,simple
under the cap there are gills the gills bear spores that will disperse and may develop into new fungi,simple
otherwise fungi use a sporangium to bear asexual spores by mitosis or sexual spores by meiosis,simple
the spores are haploid,simple
fungi may be single celled or multicellular,simple
yeast is single-celled and reproduces either sexually or asexually,simple
asexual reproduction occurs by simple budding binary fission,simple
the mycelium is the vegetative non-reproductive part of a fungus,simple
it is usually underground or inside some other substance and made of filaments called hyphae,simple
hyphae look like threads or rootlets,simple
the mat of hyphae may be very thickly woven,simple
the fungus uses them to extract nutrients,simple
hyphae are usually syncytia,simple
this means the cell walls septa are mostly not complete and the cell nuclei are not separated from each other as in normal cells,simple
details differ between species,simple
symbiosis means living together,simple
lichens are a symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or bacterium,simple
in this partnership the algal cells live inside the fungus tissue,simple
the end result is a new mat-like life-form which clings to rock and other surfaces,simple
about of all fungi are lichenized,simple
another important kind of symbiosis is mycorrhiza,simple
this is when a fungus lives inside plant roots most trees have mycorrhizal roots and so do many crop plants,simple
both sides benefit in this arrangement,simple
some fungi cause crop diseases others cause serious disease in humans,simple
some are highly poisonous : never eat a mushroom picked in the wild unless you know what you are doing,simple
edible fungi are widely used as human food,simple
certain types of cheese need a fungal species to be added,simple
the fungi give a unique flavor and texture to the cheese,simple
some fungi produce psychotropic mind-altering substances,simple
several species most notably psilocybin mushrooms colloquially known as magic mushrooms are taken for their psychedelic properties so they are illegal in many countries around the world,simple
in modern times some fungi for example penicillin have been used as a source of antibiotics,simple
the antibiotics are produced by many fungi as a natural defence against bacteria,simple
mycorrhiza lichen candida == references ==,simple
before people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold but no one managed to do that,simple
this was called alchemy,simple
alchemists separated the air into many parts and isolated the noble gases from it,simple
they also processed special minerals from a mine in sweden to get rare earth metals,simple
radioactivity was also discovered,simple
today chemists have discovered different elements,simple
some are very common like oxygen,simple
many are very rare and expensive like platinum,simple
some can not be found on earth and can only be made in labs like rutherfordium,simple
since the s the increased understanding of physics has changed chemists ' theories about chemical reactions,simple
with smaller and faster computers chemists have built better tools for analyzing substances,simple
these tools have been sent to study chemicals on mars,simple
police also use those tools to study evidence from crime scenes,simple
there are several types of chemistry,simple
analytical chemistry looks at which chemicals are in things,simple
for example looking at how much arsenic is in food,simple
organic chemistry looks at things that have carbon in them,simple
for example making acetylene,simple
inorganic chemistry looks at things that do not have carbon in them,simple
one example is making an integrated circuit,simple
a large area of chemistry is polymer chemistry,simple
this looks at plastics,simple
one example is making nylon,simple
because plastics are made of carbon polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry,simple
another area is biochemistry,simple
this looks at the chemistry of living things,simple
an example would be seeing how arsenic poisons people,simple
biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry,simple
there are many other small branches of chemistry,simple
,simple
the basic unit of an element is called an atom,simple
an atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down turning into a lighter element for example through nuclear fission or radioactive decay,simple
a chemical compound is a substance made up of two or more elements,simple
in a compound two or more atoms are joined together to form a molecule,simple
the tiniest speck of dust or drop of liquid that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules,simple
mixtures are substances where chemicals are mixed but not reacted,simple
an example would be mixing sand and salt,simple
this can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately,simple
chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction,simple
an example would be heating sodium bicarbonate common baking soda,simple
it will make water carbon dioxide and sodium carbonate,simple
this reaction can not be undone,simple
one very important concept in chemistry is that different atoms interact with one another in very specific proportions,simple
for example two hydrogen atoms interacting with one oxygen atom lead to the water molecule ho,simple
this relationship is known as the law of constant proportions and leads to the idea of stoichiometry a term that refers to the ratios of different atoms in chemical compounds,simple
for example in water there are always exactly hydrogen atoms to oxygen atom,simple
in carbon dioxide there are exactly oxygen atoms for carbon atom,simple
these relationships are described using chemical formulas such as ho two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom and co one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms,simple
because atoms of different elements react with one another in very specific proportions but atoms of different elements have different weights chemists often describe the amount of different elements and compounds in terms of the number of moles,simple
a mole of any element contains the same number of atoms : atoms,simple
the atomic mass of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole,simple
for example the atomic mass of copper is about,simple
that means about,simple
grams of copper metal has a mole of atoms,simple
the atomic mass of chlorine is about,simple
that means,simple
grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it,simple
moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds too,simple
copperii chloride is an example,simple
cucl is its chemical formula,simple
there is one copper atom,simple
and two chlorine atoms,simple
· =,simple
add all the molar masses of the elements together to get the molar mass of the chemical compound,simple
,simple
=,simple
that means in,simple
grams of copperii chloride there is one mole of copperii chloride molecules,simple
this concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants chemicals that are reacted should be left,simple
if too much reactant is used there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction,simple
acids and bases are common chemicals,simple
acids release h ions when in water and bases release oh− ions when in water,simple
acids can react with bases,simple
the h ion is taken from the acid by the base,simple
this makes water ho,simple
a salt is also made when an acid and a base react together,simple
an example would be reacting hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh,simple
hydrochloric acid releases h and cl- ions in water,simple
the base releases na and oh- ions,simple
the h and the oh- react to make water,simple
there is a solution of sodium chloride nacl left,simple
sodium chloride is a salt,simple
chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science,simple
most objects are made by chemists people who do chemistry,simple
chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances,simple
chemists make new drugs and materials like paints that we use every day,simple
many chemicals are harmless but there are some chemicals that are dangerous,simple
for example mercuryii chloride is very toxic,simple
chromates can cause cancer,simple
tinii chloride pollutes water easily,simple
hydrochloric acid can cause bad burns,simple
some chemicals like hydrogen can explode or catch fire,simple
to stay safe chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab,simple
they use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained,simple
the chemicals used in drugs and in things like bleach have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly,simple
periodic table list of common elements common chemical apparatus laboratory techniques chemical techniques glycerol aerosol,simple
chemical elements are also given a unique chemical symbol,simple
chemical symbols are used all over the world,simple
this means that no matter which language is spoken there is no confusion about what the symbol means,simple
chemical symbols of elements come from their english or latin names,simple
for example carbon has the chemical symbol 'c ' and sodium has chemical symbol 'na ' after the latin natrium,simple
tungsten is called 'w ' after its german name wolfram,simple
'au ' is the symbol for gold and it comes from the latin word for gold aurum,simple
another symbol which comes from latin is 'ag ',simple
this is the element silver and it comes from the latin argentum,simple
lead 's symbol 'pb ' comes from the latin plumbum and the english word plumber derives from this as pipes used to be made out of lead,simple
some more recently discovered elements were named after famous people like einsteinium which was named after albert einstein,simple
elements can join react to form pure compounds such as water salts oxides and organic compounds,simple
in many cases these compounds have a fixed composition and their own structure and properties,simple
the properties of the compound may be very different from the elements it is made from,simple
sodium is a metal that burns when put into water and chlorine is a poisonous gas,simple
when they react together they make sodium chloride salt which is harmless and edible,simple
some elements mix together in any proportion to form new structures,simple
such new structures are not compounds,simple
they are called mixtures or when the elements are metals alloys,simple
most elements in nature consist of atoms with different numbers of neutrons,simple
an isotope is a form of an element with a certain number of neutrons,simple
for example carbon has two stable naturally occurring isotopes : carbon- neutrons and carbon- neutrons,simple
carbon- neutrons is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of carbon,simple
of each element except for ununoctium at least two isotopes are known,simple
elements can be classified based on physical states,simple
at room temperature and pressure most elements are solids only are gases and are liquids,simple
elements can also be classified into metals and non-metals,simple
there are many more metals than non-metals,simple
however a few elements have properties in between those of metals and non-metals,simple
these elements are called semimetals or metalloids,simple
periodic table == references ==,simple
weather happens because different parts of the earth get different amounts of heat from the sun,simple
this makes different climates,simple
the tropics get the most heat because the sun shines straight down on them while the poles get the least heat because the sun shines on them from a low angle,simple
warmer air is lighter than cooler air and rises higher in the sky by convection,simple
the air always has some water mixed with it,simple
this is called humidity,simple
when it cools the water can change from a gas to a liquid through condensation,simple
then the water can fall from the sky as rain or snow,simple
after the air rises it gets colder and goes back towards the ground,simple
because the air lost its water before it is dry when it comes back to the ground,simple
wind is made when two areas of air of different temperatures meet,simple
this is called a warm front or cold front,simple
the hot air is forced to rise over the cold causing condensation which forms rain,simple
the ways that the air moves around the earth are called atmospheric circulation,simple
astronomy is the oldest natural science,simple
the sumerians ancient egyptians and indus valley civilization all understood that the objects in the sky moved since before bc,simple
this is because they worshiped the objects in the sky as gods,simple
their understanding was n't scientific but their observations influenced later astronomy,simple
a significant amount of astronomy came from mesopotamia babylonia ancient egypt and ancient greece,simple
astronomers from egypt built monuments that showed how objects in the sky moved and most of the names for the constellations in the northern hemisphere came from greek astronomers,simple
natural philosophy started in greece around bc when a movement of philosophers replaced superstition with naturalism which refuted the spiritual,simple
leucippus and his student democritus suggested the idea of the atom around this period,simple
islamic scholars continued to study aristotelian physics during the islamic golden age,simple
they also developed an early form of the scientific method,simple
scientists like ibn sahl al-kindi ibn al-haytham al-farisi and avicenna worked extensively on optics and vision,simple
in the book of optics ibn al-haytham rejected previous greek ideas concerning vision and proposed a new theory,simple
he studied how light enters the eye and then developed the camera obscura,simple
european scientists later built eyeglasses magnifying glasses telescopes and cameras from this book,simple
physics became a separate field of study after the scientific revolution,simple
galileo 's experiments helped to create classical physics,simple
although he did not invent the telescope he used it when he looked into the night sky,simple
he discovered that the stars and planets were not perfect,simple
he also investigated gravity,simple
isaac newton used galileo 's ideas to create his three laws of motion,simple
he also developed calculus to help understand problems in mechanics such as how celestial bodies moved around the sun,simple
in a couple centuries the industrial revolution was in full swing and many more discoveries were made in many fields of science,simple
the laws of classical physics are good enough to study objects that move much slower than the speed of light and are not microscopic,simple
when scientists first studied quantum mechanics they had to create a new set of laws which was the start of modern physics,simple
as scientists researched particles they discovered what classical mechanics could not explain,simple
classical mechanics predicted that the speed of light varied but experiments showed the speed of light stayed the same,simple
this was predicted by albert einstein 's theory of special relativity,simple
einstein predicted that the speed of electromagnetic radiation through empty space would always be the same,simple
his view of space-time replaced the ancient idea that space and time were quite separate things,simple
max planck came up with quantum mechanics to explain why metal releases electrons when you shine a light at it and why matter emits radiation,simple
quantum mechanics applies for very small things like the electrons protons and neutrons that make up an atom,simple
people like werner heisenberg erwin schrödinger and paul dirac continued to work on quantum mechanics and eventually we got the standard model,simple
physics is the study of energy and matter in space and time and how they are related to each other,simple
physicists assume the existence of mass length time and electric current and then define give the meaning of all other physical quantities in terms of these basic units,simple
mass length time and electric current are never defined but the standard units used to measure them are always defined,simple
in the international system of units abbreviated si from the french système international the kilogram is the basic unit of mass the metre is the basic unit of length the second is the basic unit of time and the ampere is the basic unit of electric current,simple
in addition to these four units there are three other ones : the mole which is the unit of the quantity of matter the candela which measures the luminous intensity the power of lighting and the kelvin the unit of temperature,simple
physics studies how things move and the forces that make them move,simple
for example velocity and acceleration are used by physics to show how things move,simple
also physicists study the forces of gravity electricity magnetism and the forces that hold things together,simple
physics studies very large things and very small things,simple
for instance physicists can study stars planets and galaxies but could also study small pieces of matter such as atoms and electrons,simple
they may also study sound light and other waves,simple
as well as that they could examine energy heat and radioactivity and even space and time,simple
physics not only helps people understand how objects move but how they change form how they make noise how hot or cold they will be and what they are made of at the smallest level,simple
physics is a quantitative science because it is based on measuring with numbers,simple
mathematics is used in physics to make models that try to guess what will happen in nature,simple
the guesses are compared to the way the real world works,simple
these guesses are made by theoretical physicists and they are compared to the real world by experimental physicists,simple
physicists are always working to make their models of the world better,simple
,simple
physics is the science of matter and how matter interacts,simple
matter is any physical material in the universe,simple
everything is made of matter,simple
physics is used to describe the physical universe around us and to predict how it will behave,simple
physics is the science concerned with the discovery and characterization of the universal laws which govern matter movement and forces and space and time and other features of the natural world,simple
the sweep of physics is broad from the smallest components of matter and the forces that hold it together to galaxies and even larger things,simple
there are only four forces that appear to operate over this whole range,simple
however even these four forces gravity electromagnetism the weak force associated with radioactivity and the strong force which holds protons and neutrons in an atom together are believed to be different parts of a single force,simple
physics is mainly focused on the goal of making ever simpler more general and more accurate rules that define the character and behavior of matter and space itself,simple
one of the major goals of physics is making theories that apply to everything in the universe,simple
in other words physics can be viewed as the study of those universal laws which define at the most basic level possible the behavior of the physical universe,simple
physics uses the scientific method,simple
that is data from experiments and observations are collected,simple
theories which attempt to explain these data are produced,simple
physics uses these theories to not only describe physical phenomena but to model physical systems and predict how these physical systems will behave,simple
physicists then compare these predictions to observations or experimental evidence to show whether the theory is right or wrong,simple
the theories that are well supported by data and are especially simple and general are sometimes called scientific laws,simple
of course all theories including those known as laws can be replaced by more accurate and more general laws when a disagreement with data is found,simple
physics is more quantitative than most other sciences,simple
that is many of the observations in physics may be represented in the form of numerical measurements,simple
most of the theories in physics use mathematics to express their principles,simple
most of the predictions from these theories are numerical,simple
this is because of the areas which physics has addressed work better with quantitative approaches than other areas,simple
sciences also tend to become more quantitative with time as they become more highly developed and physics is one of the oldest sciences,simple
classical physics normally includes the fields of mechanics optics electricity magnetism acoustics and thermodynamics,simple
modern physics is a term normally used to cover fields which rely on quantum theory including quantum mechanics atomic physics nuclear physics particle physics and condensed matter physics as well as the more modern fields of general and special relativity but these last two are often considered fields of classical physics as they do not rely on quantum theory,simple
although this difference can be found in older writings it is of little new interest as quantum effects are now understood to be of importance even in fields that before were called classical,simple
there are many approaches to studying physics and many different kinds of activities in physics,simple
there are two main types of activities in physics the collection of data and the development of theories,simple
the data in some subfields of physics is amenable to experiment,simple
for example condensed matter physics and nuclear physics benefit from the ability to perform experiments,simple
experimental physics focuses mainly on an empirical approach,simple
sometimes experiments are done to explore nature and in other cases experiments are performed to produce data to compare with the predictions of theories,simple
some other fields in physics like astrophysics and geophysics are mostly observational sciences because most of their data has to be collected passively instead of through experimentation,simple
however observational programs in these fields use many of the same tools and technology that are used in the experimental subfields of physics,simple
theoretical physics often uses quantitative approaches to develop the theories that attempt to explain the data,simple
in this way theoretical physicists often use tools from mathematics,simple
theoretical physics often can involve creating quantitative predictions of physical theories and comparing these predictions quantitatively with data,simple
theoretical physics sometimes creates models of physical systems before data is available to test and support these models,simple
these two main activities in physics data collection theory production and testing use many different skills,simple
this has led to a lot of specialization in physics and the introduction development and use of tools from other fields,simple
for example theoretical physicists use mathematics and numerical analysis and statistics and probability and computer software in their work,simple
experimental physicists develop instruments and techniques for collecting data using engineering and computer technology and many other fields of technology,simple
often the tools from these other areas are not quite appropriate for the needs of physics and need to be changed or more advanced versions have to be made,simple
it is frequent for new physics to be discovered if experimental physicists do an experiment that current theories can not explain or for theoretical physicists to generate theories which can then be put to the test by experimental physicists,simple
experimental physics engineering and technology are related,simple
experiments often need specialized tools such as particle accelerators lasers and important industrial applications such as transistors and magnetic resonance imaging have come from applied research,simple

famous theoretical physicists include,simple
astronomy energy matter time,simple
if milk is not kept cold in a refrigerator it will become sour after some time,simple
when milk is warmed it turns sour,simple
fermentation makes this happen,simple
lactic acid bacteria change the milk sugar into lactic acid,simple
fermentation is used when making dairy products,simple
milk is often pasteurised before humans drink it,simple
it is made into dairy products like cream butter yoghurt ice cream or cheese,simple
pasteurised cows ' milk will turn sour if it is not kept in a refrigerator,simple
milk should be stored between ° and ° celsius,simple
if milk is treated with very high temperatures it will last longer before spoiling,simple
this means it does not have to be put in the refrigerator until it is opened,simple
milk contains a chemical called lactose,simple
babies make an enzyme called lactase inside their bodies,simple
adults make less lactase,simple
if they do not have enough they may not be able to digest lactose anymore,simple
this problem is called lactose intolerance and it affects many adults,simple
there are many medicines that help adults digest lactose,simple
many lactose-intolerant people drink soy milk instead of animal milk because it does not contain lactose,simple
soy milk tastes similar to animal milk but it is chemically very different and is made from soybeans,simple
goat 's milk is the milk from a goat,simple
it can be drunk both by humans or baby goats or cheese can be made from it,simple
this cheese is called goat 's milk cheese,simple
coconut milk is not real milk because it comes from a plant instead of an animal,simple
however it looks similar to real milk because it is white,simple
it also does not have as many nutrients as real milk,simple
it is made by removing the white meat from a coconut pressing or squeezing the meat then adding water,simple
it is sometimes used in cooking for example in thai curry,simple
coconut cream is a thicker version of coconut milk which contains added sugar,simple
milk forms an important part of a person 's daily balanced diet,simple
it contains a lot of calcium that helps bones and teeth to grow stronger,simple
also milk provides the body with high quality proteins and helps in meeting the body 's requirement for vitamins,simple
one glass of milk gives about to the recommended daily vitamins intake,simple
some kind of milks though do not have good calcium,simple
these kind of milk products include cream cottage cheese ricotta cheese and cream cheese,simple

water is a fluid,simple
water is the only chemical substance on earth that exists naturally in three states,simple
people know of over anomalies about water,simple
unlike most other liquids such as alcohol or oil when water freezes it expands by about,simple
this expansion can cause pipes to break if the water inside them freezes,simple
water is a molecule made of hydrogen atoms and oxygen atom,simple
its chemical formula is ho,simple
like other liquids water has a surface tension so a little water can make drops on a surface rather than always spreading out to wet the surface,simple
things having something to do with water may have hydro or aqua in their name such as hydropower or aquarium from the greek and latin names for water,simple
it is also called the universal solvent because it dissolves many things,simple
plants and animals including people are mostly water inside and must drink water to live,simple
it gives a medium for chemical reactions to take place and is the main part of blood,simple
it keeps the body temperature the same by sweating from the skin,simple
water helps blood carry nutrients from the stomach to all parts of the body to keep the body alive,simple
water also helps the blood carry oxygen from the lungs to the body,simple
saliva which helps animals and people digest food is mostly water,simple
water helps make urine,simple
urine helps remove bad chemicals from the body,simple
the human body is between and water,simple
water is the main component of drinks like milk juice and wine,simple
each type of drink also has other things that add flavor or nutrients things like sugar fruit and sometimes alcohol,simple
water that a person can drink is called potable water or drinking water,simple
the water in oceans is salt water but lakes and rivers usually have unsalted water,simple
only about of all the water on earth is fresh water,simple
the rest is salt water,simple
many places including cities and deserts do n't have as much water as people want,simple
they build aqueducts to bring water there,simple
though people can survive a few months without food they can only survive for a day or two without water,simple
a few desert animals can get enough water from their food but the others must drink,simple
water has no smelltaste or color water is also used for recreational purposes see list of water sports,simple
water is used as both the coolant and the neutron moderator in most nuclear reactors,simple
this may be ordinary water called light water in the nuclear industry or heavy water,simple
the idea of human rights originated from ideas found in religion and philosophy in western europe,simple
the modern western idea of human rights started in the european enlightenment,simple
in the th century some people started suggesting that everyone had the religious and political right to choose their religion and their leaders,simple
this sort of thinking was important in the english civil war,simple
after the war the philosopher john locke argued that people should have these rights he was one of the first people to call them human rights,simple
these ideas were also important in the american revolution and the french revolution in the th century,simple
in the th century john stuart mill was an important philosopher who also thought about human rights,simple
he said that people should be able to control their own bodies and minds,simple
he talked about three special ideas : freedom of speech freedom of assembly freedom to do what a person wishes if it does not harm others even if other people think it is badhegel was a philosopher who talked about the idea of free will,simple
he also talked about what makes a person free : that a person has to have certain relations with other people to have true freedom,simple
a person has to be able to : own property make contracts with other people make moral promises to people live with anyone get protection from laws have a voice in government,simple
because people believe that human rights are important countries make laws to protect them,simple
these laws say that governments can not take away people 's basic rights,simple
they make sure people who take away other people 's rights are punished,simple
some major political organizations have made statements that promote human rights,simple
these are not laws but they affect us anyway,simple
if groups or countries do not follow these statements others will condemn them say that they are very bad and then people may not talk with them do business with them or help them,simple
some of the important places that human rights laws are written is in constitutions,simple
the united states constitution and constitution of france are two of the oldest set of laws based on human rights,simple
in the united nations made the universal declaration of human rights,simple
this is a widely respected document that says what the united nations believes are human rights,simple
it is not a law but is the basis on which two important agreements are written : the international covenant on civil and political rights the international covenant on economic social and cultural rightsthese are united nations human rights covenants : agreements between people or countries,simple
the countries who sign these two covenants agree to follow them,simple
in addition to those declaration and covenants there are many treaties and documents made by united nations and other international organizations,simple
those treaties and documents are called international human rights law,simple
not everyone agrees on what the basic human rights are,simple
it is very clear that few countries permit all these rights,simple
also there are countries in which the rights are not illegal but nothing is done to promote them,simple
here is a list of some of the most recognized rights :,simple
right to live to be a citizen of a country right to housing to own property,simple
safety from violence physical mental and sexual to seek asylum if a country treats you badly fair trial and to be considered innocent until proven guilty,simple
the right to get an education health care medical care to believe and practice the religion a person wants,simple
right to marriage and family equality of both males and females women 's rights not be forced into marriage the right to express his or her sexual orientation,simple
the right to express oneself : free speech to vote to peacefully protest speak against a government or group to petition,simple
abuse means to intentionally harm a person or people physically mentally emotionally or verbally once or many times,simple
human rights abuse follows along similarly also keeping in count the universal rights,simple
human rights abuse happens when a person is hurt in a way that violates goes against his/her human rights,simple
human rights abuses are also often called human rights violations,simple
examples of human rights abuses or violations are : putting a person in jail because they said that the government is doing bad things or because they are religious or not religious,simple
taking a person 's home because they are from a different country not letting someone who is a citizen of a country vote because he or she has the wrong kind of attribute as mentioned on top of article,simple
violence toward someone because they have a or any religion or a different religion to the one of the abuser,simple
many people groups and countries think protecting human rights is very important,simple
but not everyone in the world believes in human rights,simple
if people who do not believe in human rights have political power they can hurt many people,simple
even if these people have no political power they can be violent to other people,simple
there are many people who work to protect everyone 's human rights some of these are government groups and some are not with any government,simple
they are sometimes called human rights organizations,simple
amnesty international and human rights watch are examples of human rights organizations,simple
united nations human rights council united nations high commissioner for human rights,simple
art is divided into the plastic arts where something is made and the performing arts where something is done by humans in action,simple
the other division is between pure arts done for themselves and practical arts done for a practical purpose but with artistic content,simple
plastic arts fine art is expression by making something beautiful or appealing to the emotions by visual means : drawing painting printmaking sculpture literature : poetry creative writing performing arts performing art including drama are expression using the body : dance acting singing auditory art expression by making sounds : music singing practical arts culinary art expression by making flavors and tastes : cooking the practical arts expression by making things and structures : architecture filming fashion photography video games,simple
some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind spirit and soul,simple
an artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people the number of people who can relate to it and how much they appreciate it,simple
some people also get inspired,simple
the first and broadest sense of art means arrangement or to arrange,simple
in this sense art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design,simple
art may express emotion,simple
artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them,simple
most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience,simple
however if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well then the art work may become publicly successful,simple
there are sculptures cave painting and rock art dating from the upper paleolithic era,simple
all of the great ancient civilizations such as ancient egypt india china greece rome and persia had works and styles of art,simple
in the middle ages most of the art in europe showed people from the bible in paintings stained glass windows and mosaic tile floors and walls,simple
islamic art includes geometric patterns islamic calligraphy and architecture,simple
in india and tibet painted sculptures dance and religious painting were done,simple
in china arts included jade carving bronze pottery poetry calligraphy music painting drama and fiction,simple
there are many chinese artistic styles which are usually named after the ruling dynasty,simple
in europe after the middle ages there was a renaissance which means rebirth,simple
people rediscovered science and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects,simple
people like michelangelo and leonardo da vinci still painted religious pictures but they also now could paint mythological pictures too,simple
these artists also invented perspective where things in the distance look smaller in the picture,simple
this was new because in the middle ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other,simple
in the late s artists in europe responding to modernity created many new painting styles such as classicism romanticism realism and impressionism,simple
the history of twentieth century art includes expressionism fauvism cubism dadaism surrealism and minimalism,simple
in some societies people think that art belongs to the person who made it,simple
they think that the artist put his or her talent and industry into the art,simple
in this view the art is the property of the artist protected by copyright,simple
in other societies people think that art belongs to no one,simple
they think that society has put its social capital into the artist and the artist 's work,simple
in this view society is a collective that has made the art through the artist,simple
the functions of art include : cognitive function works of art let us know about what the author knew and about what the surrounding of the author were like,simple
aesthetic function works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure a sensation of beauty,simple
prognostic function some artists draw what they see the future like and some of them are right but most are not,simple
recreation function art makes us think about it not about reality we have a rest,simple
value function what did the artist value ? what aims did he like/dislike in human activity ? this usually is clearly seen in artists ' works,simple
didactic function what message criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve ?,simple
modern art abstract art painting sculpture street art == references ==,simple
humans are hosts to nearly species of parasitic worms and over species of protozoa some derived from our primate ancestors and some acquired from the animals we have domesticated or come in contact with during our relatively short history on earth,simple
our knowledge of parasitic infections extends into antiquity,simple
when the above definition is applied many organisms which eat plants can be seen as parasites because they feed largely or wholly on one individual plant,simple
examples would include many herbivorous insects : the hemiptera or true bugs leafhoppers froghoppers aphids scale insects and whiteflies,simple
the larvae of lepidoptera usually feed and mature on a single individual of the host plant species and what they eat accounts for most of the food for their complete life span,simple
moreover caterpillars can and often do serious damage to the host 's foliage,simple
other orders also have many parasitic herbivores : thysanoptera thrips coleoptera beetles diptera flies,simple
parasites of larger animals account for much research done for veterinarian and medical purposes,simple
these parasites include viruses bacteria protozoa flatworms flukes and tapeworms nematodes roundworms arthropods crustacea insects mites,simple
parasitic wasps and flies are of great interest to the entomologist and may be used in biological control,simple
on the other hand many blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes have only brief contact with a host and so perhaps should not be regarded as parasites,simple
pa huge number of species are parasitic,simple
a survey of the feeding habits of british insects showed that about were parasites on plants and slightly more were parasites on animals,simple
that means that nearly of insects in britain are parasitic,simple
since british insects are better known than those elsewhere because of the length of time they have been studied this means that the majority of insect species throughout the world are parasitic,simple
also there are several other invertebrate phyla which are wholly or largely parasitic,simple
flatworms and roundworms are found in virtually every wild species of vertebrate,simple
protozoan parasites are also ubiquitous,simple
hence parasitism is almost certainly the most common feeding method on earth,simple
it is clear that parasitism as a way of life is more common than all other feeding strategies combined,simple
p,simple
ectoparasites live on the outside of a plant or animal,simple
endoparasites live inside a plant or animal,simple
intracellular parasites live inside cells intercellular parasites live in the spaces between cells,simple
parasitoids are organisms whose larval development takes place within another organism 's body resulting in the death of the host,simple
there are twelve superfamilies of wasps which are entirely or mainly parasitoid such as the ichneumonoid wasps whose species number over,simple
the interaction between the parasitoid and the host is fundamentally different from true parasites and their host and shares some characteristics with predation,simple
a vector is a third party that carries the parasite to the host,simple
thus with malaria the mosquito is the vector the plasmodium protozoan is the parasite and the mammal is the host,simple
the mosquito is an ectoparasite as well as a vector,simple
an epiparasite is one that feeds on another parasite,simple
kleptoparasites steal food from other species,simple
brood parasites such as the cuckoo induce other species to raise their young,simple
the cowbird is another brood parasite,simple
social parasites take advantage of interactions between members of social organisms such as ants or termites,simple
,simple
parasites are adapted to small separated habitats,simple
for a parasite each host is an island surrounded by a hostile environment,simple
for a small organism the distances between hosts or groups of hosts is a hazard,simple
adaptations to bridge this hazard are : mass production of spores or eggs,simple
dispersal of fertile females,simple
dispersal by attaching to a larger organism many ectoparasites,simple
extreme longevity of resting stages spores or cysts,simple
for example plant parasitic nematodes may remain quiescent for years,simple
parthenogenesis and inbreeding among offspring of a single female are common in parasites,simple
so parasites exist in small genetically similar groups with little flow of genes between them,simple
in consequence they have adaptations to solve their problems of dispersal and reproduction,simple
parasites face an environment which varies in time and space,simple
consequently both local geographic races and polymorphism occur,simple
both may occur in the same species,simple
parasites are very specialised feeders : many species have only one host at any stage of their life cycle,simple
a few use more than two host species,simple
many parasites have complex life-cycles,simple
tremadodes the flukes are a parasitic class of flatworms platyhelminths with over species,simple
most of them infect molluscs in the first part of the life-cycle and vertebrates in the second part,simple
the biology of scrub typhus is even more complex,simple
it involves these factors :,simple
the pathogen bacterium rickettsia,simple
,simple
chiggers which are ectoparasitic mites,simple
,simple
small mammals especially rats,simple
,simple
scrubby vegetation with moist conditions,simple
humans passing through patches where the above are present,simple
the occurrence of all these factors together would be limited in space and brief in time,simple
this is typical of the ecology of parasitic infections,simple
,simple
both evolutionary rates and speciation rates can be high,simple
sibling species are very common in the bug erythroneura in which about transfers from one host to another has resulted in about species in the genus,simple
the clearest evidence comes from the large size of many parasitic families,simple
even though some parasitic taxa evolved much later than predatory taxa families of parasites on plants are on average almost eight times larger than those of predators and families of parasites on animals are over ten times larger,simple
psometimes there is good evidence of the speed of speciation,simple
for example five or more species of the moth hedylepta must have evolved within years in hawaii because they are specific to banana which was only introduced then,simple
adaptive radiation in parasites is extensive,simple
its development in each taxon group depends on : the diversity of the hosts,simple
how many species there are in the group being parastised and how different they are from each other,simple
the size of the host target : body size population geographical distribution,simple
the evolutionary time available for colonisation of hosts,simple
the selective pressure for evolutionary modification,simple
diversity of hosts is a big factor,simple
if many related species of host are available then many related species of parasite will evolve,simple
mites on lepidoptera families or fleas on mammals and birds are good examples,simple
eichler 's rule goes as follows : when a large group of hosts consisting of a wide variety of species is compared with an equivalent group consisting of few representatives the larger group has the greater diversity of parasitic fauna,simple
the two british oaks support some species of parasite directly and indirectly many hundred more which parasitise these parasites,simple
it would certainly be an underestimate to say that the two british species of oak are the primary products for a thousand species of parasite,simple
p obviously the large size of these trees is a factor in the number of parasite species,simple
in general this holds whether the host is a plant or an animal,simple
a larger bird will harbour more species of ectoparasite than a small bird,simple
one of the reasons large trees have so many parasites is that they may have lived a long time in a particular area compared with other types of plant,simple
they have had longer to accumulate parasites,simple
parasites can be most useful in sorting out the phylogenetic relationships of their hosts,simple
sibling host species have been discovered when their parasites diverged,simple
common ancestors of present-day parasites were themselves parasites of the common ancestors of present-day hosts,simple
as the host evolves defences so the parasite evolves to cope with this,simple
this is co-evolution,simple
consider two families of host plants the umbellifers fennel cumin parsley hemlock and the gramineae grasses,simple
the umbellifers have many aromatic species and are chemically diverse and pharmaceutically interesting,simple
their resins and oils are defences against herbivory and parasitism,simple
on the other hand grasses have one big defence to herbivores : their stony inclusions in their cells wear down the teeth of herbivorous mammals but they have few chemical defences,simple
both families are attacked by leaf-miner flies,simple
there are four times as many grass species as there are umbellifers but there are twice as many leaf-miner species on the umbellifers,simple
this is apparently because the chemical diversity of potential hosts within the umbelliferae has forced specialisation of the parasites,simple
eighty-two percent of the species of leaf-miner attack only one genus each,simple
this is speciation which does not require geographical isolation,simple
ernst mayr the chief exponent of geographical speciation admitted that host races of phytophagous animals constitute the only known case indicating the possible occurrence of incipient sympatric speciation,simple
wikipedia began as a related project for nupedia,simple
nupedia was a free online english-language encyclopedia project,simple
nupedia 's articles were written and owned by bomis inc which is a web portal company,simple
the main people of the company were jimmy wales the guy in charge of bomis and larry sanger the editor-in-chief for nupedia,simple
nupedia was first licensed under the nupedia open content license which was changed to the gnu free documentation license before wikipedia was founded when richard stallman requested them,simple
larry sanger and jimmy wales are the ones who started wikipedia,simple
wales is credited with defining the goals of the project,simple
sanger created the strategy of using a wiki to reach wales ' goal,simple
on january larry sanger proposed on the nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a feeder project for nupedia,simple
wikipedia was launched on january,simple
it was launched as an english-language edition at www,simple
wikipedia,simple
com and announced by sanger on the nupedia mailing list,simple
wikipedia 's policy of neutral point-of-view was codified in its initial months and was similar to nupedia 's earlier nonbiased policy,simple
otherwise there were not very many rules initially and wikipedia operated independently of nupedia,simple
wikipedia gained early contributors from nupedia slashdot and also from search engines,simple
it grew to about articles and languages by the end of,simple
by late it had languages by the end of and by the end of,simple
nupedia and wikipedia both existed until nupedia 's servers were stopped in,simple
after this its text was incorporated into wikipedia,simple
the english wikipedia passed the million-article mark on september making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled even larger than the yongle encyclopedia which had held the record for exactly years,simple
the english wikipedia reached million articles in august,simple
the numbers of articles and of contributors appeared to be growing less quickly around spring,simple
in october the wikipedia monument was unveiled to the public in poland to honor all the contributors of the wikipedia,simple
on january wikipedia celebrated its th anniversary,simple
it used a special logo pictured to celebrate its years since it opened on january and the logo was used for the whole day on the sidebar of the english wikipedia,simple
wikipedia is a free site just like the online encyclopedia that anybody can start or edit a page,simple
a global site that is available in many languages,simple
while people can use any searching engine the wikipedia page will come out in the first results of many searches,simple
to use wikipedia better people should understand the basic function on the page,simple
the page is organized while they are looking up the page,simple
as wikipedia users they should have good understanding of wikipedia,simple

prototypical documents : letters memos legal forms instruction manual documents of record : newspapers and magazines books : text book novels recipe books encyclopedia comic books canonical documents : the bibleiliad and odysseyvedas ramayana mahabharata quran code of hammurabitao te ching transactional documents : cheque contracts prescription receipt form document postage stamp functional documents : pdf files postscript files xml files email non-prototypical documents : post-it notes fortune cookie strips maps paintings milk cartons cereal boxes non-classical digital documents : web page weblog wiki boundary examples : the plaque on the pioneer spacecraft designed by astronomer carl sagan and using information assumed to be universal is an extreme example of a document that is intended to communicate with aliens,simple
on the other hand the recorded and printed signals of the seti project would constitute documents if they were discovered to contain alien communication,simple
what most people understand when they speak of a document one can see from the connotations and denotations that appear in a search for document,simple
from these usages one can infer the following typical connotations : writing that provides information especially information of an official nature anything serving as a representation of a person 's thinking by means of symbolic marks a written account of ownership or obligation to record in detail the parents documented every step of their child 's development a digital file in a particular format to support or supply with references can you document your claims ? an artifact that meets a legal notion of document for purposes of discovery in litigation,simple
technology to manage documents has developed with documents themselves,simple
of particular importances are practices concerning the preservation archival destruction and management of documents,simple
these together are called the document life cycle physical preservation : documents in both traditional physical forms and in digital physical forms such as magnetic media must be physically preserved,simple
this aspect of document management deals with such issues as the aging of paper the innovation of acid-free paper is an advance in preservation and obsolescence of magnetic media,simple
storage : this aspect includes management of scarce resources such as shelf space and disk space and associated technologies such as optimal space utilization,simple
modern libraries such as the university of nevada and the university of michigan often use complex space-saving technologies such as robotic retrieval systems for stacks and moving bookshelves,simple
in the digital realm the entire discipline of compression technologies can be viewed as concerned with the storage of documents,simple
cultural preservation : this function traditionally ascribed to librarians involves the selection arrangement and storage of documents in safe places,simple
the importance of this part of document life cycle management can be seen in the impact of historical events such as the burning of the library of alexandria,simple
today library and information science has developed into an important academic discipline,simple
bibliometrics : this aspect of document management involves functions of indexing generating statistics and taxonomies and improving the usability of large collections of documents,simple
the modern history of this management technology dates back to melvil dewey and the dewey decimal system,simple
today the science of bibliometrics is largely concerned with managing the impact of electronic technologies,simple
this aspect must also deal with isbn numbers library of congress data and other standards,simple
digital content management : the explosion of digital content has resulted in technologies to manage large collections of digital information generated by organizations,simple
such systems must manage access control and privileges multiple electronic format interface with printing infrastructures and enable collaborative workflows around documents,simple
digital-physical interaction management : as long as both paper and digital documents continue to have value the modern management technologies to manage their interaction will continue,simple
key to this management is the management of large scale and systematic scanning of physical documents such as the google book scanning project,simple
destruction : with the increased cost of identity theft corporate scandals and privacy concerns the destruction of both paper and electronic documents has become increasingly important to manage,simple
technologies such as shredders play a role as do verifiable processes of destruction of electronic documents to ensure compliance with privacy laws,simple
security : shannon 's information theory has led to an entire discipline that concerns itself with the security of documents and associated technologies such as encryption as well as more physical security features such as watermarks and making currency documents safe from counterfeiting,simple
transportation : the entire postal system as well as modern courier systems is largely built on the need to move documents physically from one location to the other,simple
book illuminated manuscript seal device typewriter,simple
there are two main kinds of book text : fiction and non-fiction,simple
these books are novels about stories that did not happen and have been imagined by the author,simple
some books are based on real events from history but the author has created imaginary characters or dialogue for the events,simple
books of non-fiction are about true facts or things that have really happened,simple
some examples are dictionaries cookbooks textbooks for learning in school or a biography someone 's life story,simple
between the written manuscript and the book lie several inventions,simple
manuscripts are hand-made but books are now industrial products,simple
a common type of manuscript was the scroll which was a long sheet rolled up,simple
the sheet could have been made of papyrus made by the egyptians by weaving the inner stems of the papyrus plant and then hammering them together or parchment or vellum very thin animal skin first used by the ancient greeks or paper made from plant fibers invented by the chinese,simple
manuscripts of this kind lasted to the th century and beyond,simple
turning the manuscript into a book required several developments,simple
the romans were the first people to put separate pieces of manuscript between covers to form a codex,simple
this was more convenient to handle and store than scrolls but was not yet a book as we understand it,simple
scrolls and codices were written and copied by hand,simple
the chinese invented woodblock printing where shapes are carved out of a block of wood then ink is applied to the carved side and the block is pressed onto paper,simple
this woodcut method was slow because the symbols and pictures were made by cutting away the surrounding wood,simple
johannes gutenberg was the first to invent a machine for printing the printing press in the th century,simple
this involved more than just a press it involved the production of movable metal type suitable for the machine process,simple
initially the machines were slow and needed a printer to work with them,simple
fast and automatic machines did not arrive until the th century,simple
paper had been invented in china in the th century but it was kept secret for a long time,simple
in europe hand-made paper was available from about,simple
it was expensive and the early printing was a slow process,simple
therefore books remained rare,simple
in the first machines for making paper from wood pulp were invented,simple
new kinds of inks were also invented for various purposes and machines were driven by steam engines and later by electricity,simple
the common cheap supply of paper fed the faster printing machines and books became cheaper,simple
at the same time in america britain and continental europe more people learnt to read,simple
so in the th century many ordinary people could afford to buy books and could actually read them,simple
also in the th century came public libraries so poorer people could get access to the best books,simple
printing was done on large sheets of paper which were then folded guillotined cut and sewn in sections and finally placed into the covers,simple
all these processes were done by machines during the th century,simple
today some of the technologies have been changed especially those involving illustration and typography,simple
however books look much the same as they did with more illustration in colour but basically the same,simple
that is because experience has shown that readers need certain things for pleasurable reading,simple
graphic design and typography are the practical arts used to make books attractive and useful to readers,simple
literature reading,simple
composition music,simple
the word “ classic ” tends to mean : an art which is so good that it will always be enjoyed by future generations,simple
it is something that has become a model for future artists,simple
the period of ancient greece and rome is known as the classical period because many centuries later people looked back to those ancient civilizations and thought they were perfect,simple
in recent european history the th century was known as the classical period because musicians artists writers and philosophers were inspired by the art forms of the classical period of ancient greece and rome,simple
something that is a “ classic ” is therefore something that will always be remembered as something great,simple
famous books such as the novels of charles dickens are called classics,simple
“ classical music ” therefore tends to mean music that will not be forgotten soon after it is written but is likely to be enjoyed by many future generations,simple
although people sometimes think of classical music as the opposite of pop music it can still be very popular,simple
like all kinds of music classical music can be in many different moods : happy sad scary peaceful thoughtful simple etc,simple
mozart wrote his serenades and divertimentos to entertain people at parties,simple
classical pieces of music can be quite short but they can also be very long like a big musical story,simple
a symphony by mahler or shostakovich can last for nearly an hour and an opera is a whole evening ’ s entertainment,simple
classical music is also different from jazz because true jazz is improvised,simple
however the differences are not always obvious,simple
classical music has often been inspired by jazz and jazz by classical music,simple
george gershwin wrote music which is both jazz and classical,simple
classical music too can be improvised,simple
the great composers bach mozart and beethoven often improvised long pieces of music on the organ harpsichord or piano,simple
sometimes they wrote these improvistions down,simple
they were in effect compositions which were composed in one go,simple
in western countries a vast amount of music was written for christian worship in churches and cathedrals,simple
this is called “ sacred ” religious music,simple
all other music is “ secular ” music,simple
the word “ secular ” means things that are not sacred,simple
sacred and secular music have influenced one another in many ways during the course of music history,simple
secular music was largely influenced by dance and this in turn changed the style of scared music,simple
for example : the church music of the th century composer giovanni da palestrina has nothing to do with dance music but both the sacred and secular music of johann sebastian bach two centuries later is full of dance rhythms,simple
at some times in music history there have been different styles of composing for sacred and for secular music,simple
claudio monteverdi uses two different styles for his church and for his non-church music,simple
when composers were experimenting with new ways of writing music they usually did this with secular music and sacred music caught up later,simple
the term classical music was not used until the early th century,simple
people then started talking about classical music in order to praise the great composers such as bach mozart and beethoven,simple
in the th century many different ways of composing were used including music played by electronic instruments or very modern music using strange sounds experimental or avant garde music for example the music of john cage,simple
some people feel that this kind of music can not really be described as classical music,simple
classical music can be for instruments or for the voice,simple
the symphony orchestra is the most common group of instruments for the playing of classical music,simple
it has four families of instruments : the string instruments which include the violins violas cellos and piano the woodwind instruments which include flutes oboesclarinets and bassoons together with related instruments of different sizes the brass instruments : trumpet trombone tuba and french horn and percussion instruments which nearly always includes timpani as well as many other possible instruments which are hit or shaken,simple
this is very different from a typical rock band which has a drummer a guitarist one or two singers and an electric bass and keyboard,simple
instruments that play classical music are not normally amplified electronically,simple
the same applies to the voice,simple
singers may be sopranos altos tenors or basses depending on their vocal range,simple
their voices are not amplified,simple
opera singers in particular have to develop very powerful voices which will be heard over the orchestra and project right to the back of an opera house,simple
the instruments used in classical music developed at different times,simple
some of the earliest were known in medieval music,simple
the trombone and the triangle have hardly changed for hundreds of years but the violin family developed from folk instruments such as fiddles and gradually replaced the viols to form the basis of the modern orchestra,simple
this was happening by the beginning of the th century which was the time when opera was invented,simple
in general musical instruments have become louder as concert halls have become bigger,simple
violins are louder than viols,simple
modern violins are louder than the early th century violins largely because of they have metal strings instead of gut strings,simple
the piano developed from the clavichord which was very quiet indeed,simple
woodwind instruments developed from renaissance instruments while the clarinet was invented in the middle of the th century and the saxophone and tuba came even later,simple
modern trumpets sound much brighter than the straight trumpets of the th century,simple
most popular music is based on song form but classical music has many different forms some of which can be used over a long time span to make big compositions,simple
classical music can have many forms including the symphony concerto oratorio opera sonata fugue or any combination of dance movements such as suites,simple
in many of the longer compositions short tunes are developed and changed during the course of the piece,simple
beethoven ’ s fifth symphony is a good example of a piece which develops from just four notes into a large piece lasting about half an hour,simple
people who want to be good at performing classical music have to practice hard for many years,simple
they normally have formal training at a music college or conservatoire and have lessons from well-known music teachers,simple
classical musicians often spend a lot of time thinking carefully about pieces of music especially about pieces of music that they perform,simple
they study such things as harmony and counterpoint to help them understand the way that the composers were thinking when they put the piece together,simple
when they look at pieces of music in this way this is called “ musical analysis ”,simple
people who specialize in thinking and writing about music may become professors or lecturers of music at universities,simple
classical music is often heard in popular culture,simple
it is used as background music for movies television programs advertisements and even for mobile phone ringing tones,simple
most people in the western world recognize many classical tunes possibly without even realizing it,simple
some classical pieces of music have become enormously popular e,simple
g,simple
the song nessun dorma from giacomo puccini 's opera turandot which was sung by the three tenors luciano pavarotti plácido domingo and josé carreras and used as the theme tune for the soccer world cup,simple
this made many people who had never been interested in opera start to become curious about it,simple
,simple
the history of classical music really started in the late middle ages,simple
music written for the church was almost always vocal singing because instruments were thought to be wicked,simple
this is because the devil played them and because they were used for dancing,simple
there was a lot of dance music but most of it is lost because it was never written down,simple
medieval composers who are remembered today include léonin pérotin and guillaume de machaut,simple
the renaissance was from the th century until the th century,simple
this period saw a massive increase in the composition of music both sacred and secular,simple
many great cathedrals had been built in europe and composers wrote music for them mostly vocal music,simple
secular music also became extremely popular especially songs and madrigals which would sometimes be accompanied by instruments,simple
the greatest composers of this period include : giovanni da palestrina orlando di lasso thomas tallis and william byrd,simple
the baroque period was from about the th century until the mid-th century,simple
this was the time when the modern orchestra was formed more or less as we know it,simple
it was also the time when opera was invented,simple
most musicians worked either for the church or for rich people who had their own orchestras,simple
many of them also started to work for opera houses,simple
the greatest composers of this time include : claudio monteverdi heinrich schütz henry purcell antonio vivaldi george frideric handel johann sebastian bach domenico scarlatti and georg philipp telemann,simple
the years between - was known as the classical period,simple
composers thought a lot about the forms of their pieces and were influenced by the classical art of the ancient greeks and romans,simple
the symphony was invented and various forms of chamber music including the string quartet,simple
the greatest composers include : joseph haydn wolfgang amadeus mozart christoph willibald gluch and ludwig van beethoven,simple
from to was known as the romantic period,simple
composers continued to use the forms that had been invented in the th century but they also thought that personal feeling and emotion were very important,simple
music for orchestra sometimes told a story programme music,simple
musicians who played their instruments brilliantly such as paganini were worshipped like heroes,simple
beethoven and schubert belong in many ways to this period as well as to the classical period,simple
it was a time when there were a lot of changes in society,simple
after the wars that napoleon had waged there were not so many ruling aristocratic families,simple
there was a lot of feeling of nationalism as countries united,simple
th century music is often nationalistic : composers wrote music that was typical of their own country,simple
some of the greatest composers include : ludwig van beethoven franz schubert hector berlioz frédéric chopin robert schumann felix mendelssohn anton bruckner johannes brahms pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky edward elgar gustav mahler and richard strauss,simple
what is known as th century classical music or “ modern music ” is music from about onwards,simple
at this time many composers felt that everything had already been done by the composers of the past so they wanted to find new ways of composing,simple
claude debussy arnold schoenberg and igor stravinsky in particular found new ways of writing music which was not necessarily tonal in any particular key,simple
classical music was influenced by jazz especially with american composers,simple
later in the century people such as pierre boulez and karlheinz stockhausen experimented in many other ways including with electronic music tape recorders etc,simple
today ’ s composers have combined some of these ideas to develop their own styles,simple
some of the most important composers are : claude debussy jean sibelius maurice ravel arnold schoenberg igor stravinsky béla bartók aaron copland benjamin britten dmitri shostakovich leonard bernstein philip glass dmitri kabalevsky james macmillan judith weir peter maxwell davies,simple
it has never been possible to say exactly what is meant by “ classical music ”,simple
many different kinds of music influence one another,simple
since it has been even harder to make clear dividing lines between rock pop classical folk jazz and world music,simple
this shows that classical music like other kinds of music continues to develop and reflect the society from which it comes,simple

most humans have a problem with math,simple
to show this try doing × in your head,simple
it is hard to remember all the steps people made tools to help them remember where they were in a math problem,simple
the other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again,simple
a cashier had to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper,simple
that took a lot of time and made mistakes,simple
so people made calculators that did those same things over and over,simple
this part of computer history is called the history of automated calculation which is a fancy phrase for the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same maths problem over and over without making mistakes,simple
the abacus the slide rule the astrolabe and the antikythera mechanism which dates from about - bc are examples of automated calculation machines,simple
people do not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again,simple
for example a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again,simple
some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things,simple
for example they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time,simple
they wanted to be able to program the music box- to order the music box to play different music,simple
this part of computer history is called the history of programmable machines which is a fancy phrase for the history of machines that i can order to do different things if i know how to speak their language,simple
one of the first examples of this was built by hero of alexandria c,simple
– ad,simple
he built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums,simple
these ropes and drums were the language of the machine- they told what the machine did and when,simple
some people argue that this is the first programmable machine,simple
historians disagree on which early machines are computers,simple
many say the castle clock an astronomical clock invented by al-jazari in is the first known programmable analog computer,simple
the length of day and night could be adjusted every day in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year,simple
some count this daily adjustment as computer programming,simple
others say the first computer was made by charles babbage,simple
ada lovelace is considered to be the first programmer,simple
at the end of the middle ages people in europe thought math and engineering were more important,simple
in wilhelm schickard made a mechanical calculator,simple
other europeans made more calculators after him,simple
they were not modern computers because they could only add subtract and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play tetris,simple
because of this we say they were not programmable,simple
now engineers use computers to design and plan,simple
in joseph marie jacquard used punched paper cards to tell his textile loom what kind of pattern to weave,simple
he could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do and he could change the punch cards which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted,simple
this means the loom was programmable,simple
charles babbage wanted to make a similar machine that could calculate,simple
he called it the analytical engine,simple
because babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea he never built his analytical engine,simple
as time went on computers were used more,simple
people get bored easily doing the same thing over and over,simple
imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards storing them and then having to go find them again,simple
the u,simple
census bureau in had hundreds of people doing just that,simple
it was expensive and reports took a long time,simple
then an engineer worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work,simple
herman hollerith invented a tabulating machine that would automatically add up information that the census bureau collected,simple
the computing tabulating recording corporation which later became ibm made his machines,simple
they leased the machines instead of selling them,simple
makers of machines had long helped their users understand and repair them and ctr 's tech support was especially good,simple
because of machines like this new ways of talking to these machines were invented and new types of machines were invented and eventually the computer as we know it was born,simple
in the first half of the th century scientists started using computers mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about science questions instead of spending hours adding numbers together,simple
for example if they had to launch a rocket ship they needed to do a lot of math to make sure the rocket worked right,simple
so they put together computers,simple
these analog computers used analog circuits which made them very hard to program,simple
in the s they invented digital computers and soon made them easier to program,simple
however this is not the case as many consecutive attempts have been made to bring arithmetic logic to l,simple
analogue computers are mechanical or electronic devices which solve problems,simple
some are used to control machines,simple
scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the s and s,simple
scientists made a lot of digital computers and as they did they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them,simple
here are a few of the computers they built : konrad zuse 's electromechanical z machines,simple
the z was the first working machine that used binary arithmetic,simple
binary arithmetic means using yes and no,simple
to add numbers together,simple
you could also program it,simple
in the z was proved to be turing complete,simple
turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer,simple
it is the world 's first modern computer,simple
the non-programmable atanasoff–berry computer which used vacuum tubes to store yes and no answers and regenerative capacitor memory,simple
the harvard mark i a big computer that you could kind of program,simple
the u,simple
army 's ballistics research laboratory eniac which could add numbers the way people do using the numbers through and is sometimes called the first general purpose electronic computer since konrad zuse 's z of used electromagnets instead of electronics,simple
at first however the only way to reprogram eniac was by rewiring it,simple
several developers of eniac saw its problems,simple
they invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it and a way to change what it remembered,simple
this is known as stored program architecture or von neumann architecture,simple
john von neumann talked about this design in the paper first draft of a report on the edvac distributed in,simple
a number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time,simple
the first of these was completed in great britain,simple
the first to be demonstrated working was the manchester small-scale experimental machine ssem or baby while the edsac completed a year after ssem was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design,simple
shortly afterwards the machine originally described by von neumann 's paper—edvac—was completed but was not ready for two years,simple
nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture,simple
it has become the main concept which defines a modern computer,simple
the technologies used to build computers have changed since the s but many current computers still use the von-neumann architecture,simple
in the s computers were built out of mostly vacuum tubes,simple
transistors replaced vacuum tubes in the s because they were smaller and cheaper,simple
they also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes,simple
in the s technologies were based on integrated circuits,simple
microprocessors such as the intel made computers smaller cheaper faster and more reliable,simple
by the s microcontrollers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like washing machines,simple
the s also saw home computers and personal computers,simple
with the evolution of the internet personal computers are becoming as common as the television and the telephone in the household,simple
in nokia started to call some of its mobile phones the n-series multimedia computers and after the launch of the apple iphone in many are now starting to add the smartphone category among real computers,simple
in if smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world the biggest computer maker by units sold was no longer hewlett-packard but rather nokia,simple
there are many types of computers : personal computer workstation computer mainframe computer minicomputer supercomputer embedded system tablet computera desktop computer is a small machine that has a screen which is not part of the computer,simple
most people keep them on top of a desk which is why they are called desktop computers,simple
laptop computers are computers small enough to fit on your lap,simple
this makes them easy to carry around,simple
both laptops and desktops are called personal computers because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music surfing the web or playing video games,simple
there are bigger computers that many people at a time can use,simple
these are called mainframes and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work,simple
you can think of a personal computer like this : the personal computer is like your skin : you can see it other people can see it and through your skin you feel wind water air and the rest of the world,simple
a mainframe is more like your internal organs : you never see them and you barely even think about them but if they suddenly went missing you would have some very big problems,simple
an embedded computer also called embedded system is a computer that does one thing and one thing only and usually does it very well,simple
for example an alarm clock is an embedded computer : it tells the time,simple
unlike your personal computer you can not use your clock to play tetris,simple
because of this we say that embedded computers can not be programmed because you can not install more programs on your clock,simple
some mobile phones automatic teller machines microwave ovens cd players and cars are operated by embedded computers,simple
all-in-one computers are desktop computers that have all of the computer 's inner mechanisms in the same case as the monitor,simple
apple has made several popular examples of all-in-one computers such as the original macintosh of the mid-s and the imac of the late s and s,simple
playing computer games writing solving mathematics looking for things on the internet watching tv and movies listening to music communicating with other people downloading sending e-mail using internet recording calculating editing video photo taking pictures photography drawing study purposes,simple
word processing spreadsheets excel powerpoint presentations photo editing photoshop gimp e-mail video editing/rendering/encoding audio recording system management,simple
computers store data and the instructions as numbers because computers can do things with numbers very quickly,simple
these data are stored as binary symbols s and s,simple
a or a symbol stored by a computer is called a bit which comes from the words binary digit,simple
computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use,simple
a list of instructions is called a program and is stored on the computer 's hard disk,simple
computers work through the program by using a central processing unit and they use fast memory called ram as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this,simple
when the computer wants to store the results of the program for later it uses the hard disk because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off,simple
an operating system tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do how to do these jobs and how to tell people the results,simple
millions of computers may be using the same operating system while each computer can have its own application programs to do what its user needs,simple
using the same operating systems makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things,simple
a user who needs to use a computer for something different can learn how to use a new application program,simple
some operating systems can have simple command lines or a fully user-frendly gui,simple
one of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with communication,simple
communication is how people share information,simple
computers have helped people move forward in science medicine business and learning because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information,simple
they also let other people communicate with each other do their jobs almost anywhere learn about almost anything or share their opinions with each other,simple
the internet is the thing that lets people communicate between their computers,simple
a computer is now almost always an electronic device,simple
it usually contains materials that will become electronic waste when discarded,simple
when a new computer is bought in some places laws require that the cost of its waste management must also be paid for,simple
this is called product stewardship,simple
computers can become obsolete quickly depending on what programs the user runs,simple
very often they are thrown away within two or three years because some newer programs require a more powerful computer,simple
this makes the problem worse so computer recycling happens a lot,simple
many projects try to send working computers to developing nations so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly as most people do not need to run new programs,simple
some computer parts such as hard drives can break easily,simple
when these parts end up in the landfill they can put poisonous chemicals like lead into the ground water,simple
hard drives can also contain secret information like credit card numbers,simple
if the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away an identity thief can get the information from the hard drive even if the drive does n't work and use it to steal money from the previous owner 's bank account,simple
computers come in different forms but most of them have a common design,simple
all computers have a cpu,simple
all computers have some kind of data bus which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment,simple
all computers have some form of memory,simple
these are usually chips integrated circuits which can hold information,simple
many computers have some kind of sensors which lets them get input from their environment,simple
many computers have some kind of display device which lets them show output,simple
they may also have other peripheral devices connected,simple
a computer has several main parts,simple
when comparing a computer to a human body the cpu is like a brain,simple
it does most of the 'thinking ' and tells the rest of the computer how to work,simple
the cpu is on the motherboard which is like the skeleton,simple
it provides the basis for where the other parts go and carries the nerves that connect them to each other and the cpu,simple
the motherboard is connected to a power supply which provides electricity to the entire computer,simple
the various drives cd drive floppy drive and on many newer computers usb flash drive act like eyes ears and fingers and allow the computer to read different types of storage in the same way that a human can read different types of books,simple
the hard drive is like a human 's memory and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer,simple
most computers have a sound card or another method of making sound which is like vocal cords or a voice box,simple
connected to the sound card are speakers which are like a mouth and are where the sound comes out,simple
computers might also have a graphics card which helps the computer to create visual effects such as d environments or more realistic colors and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images in the same way a well trained artist can,simple
the president of the united states is elected by the electoral college,simple
some other countries choose a president this way,simple
in some the parliament does it,simple
some countries have direct elections to choose a president,simple
many countries have a monarch instead of a president and some have neither,simple
companies have presidents,simple
they are elected by the people who own part of the company,simple
in some companies the people who are workers for the company elect vote for their company president,simple
the president of a country is not the same thing as a prime minister,simple
a prime minister is part of a parliament but a president is not,simple
in some countries such as the united states or france the president has more power and responsibility than anyone else,simple
such a president is often called the nation 's chief executive,simple
as chief executive the president must take an active role in all phases of government,simple
in other countries such as the republic of ireland or israel to be president is more of an honor or a symbol and the position has no real power,simple
this kind of president is often called head of state,simple
most countries that have a king or queen as their monarch have no president,simple
the american president is restricted by the written united states constitution which can be changed but only if two-thirds of congress as well as the president and three-fourths of the states agree to it,simple
the american constitution was created to make sure that the american executive never became as powerful as the british system it had broken away from,simple
the british prime minister is part of both the legislature and executive whereas the american president is the head of the executive,simple
the american governmental system shows a clear separation of powers unlike the british system,simple
all the president 's ministerial appointments have to be vetted by congress parliament and congress may have an opposition majority,simple
the president does not have the ability to introduce and influence legislation in the same way as the british prime minister,simple
congress has much greater control over the budget and foreign policy than the british parliament,simple
there are broad areas of american life such as education crime and punishment over which the president has virtually no influence at all,simple
the president even has very limited control over the economy,simple
so despite having a large nuclear arsenal the american president can not carry out policy and introduce legislation as freely as the british prime minister,simple
monarch,simple
contract law sets rules on agreements to buy and sell items and services,simple
medical law sets rules and guidelines for medical professionals it also states a patient 's own medical rights,simple
physician-patient privilege protects the patient 's private conversations with a medical physician doctor this also extends to their personal information like their contact details shared with medical personnel,simple
property law states the rights and obligations that a person has when they buy sell or rent homes and land called real property or realty and objects called personal property,simple
intellectual property ip law involves the rights people have over things they create such as art music and literature,simple
this is called copyright,simple
it also protects inventions that people make by a kind of law called patent,simple
it also covers the rights people have to the names of a company or a distinctive mark or logo,simple
this is called trademark,simple
trust law business law sets out the rules for money that is put into an investment such as pension funds that people save up for their retirement,simple
it involves many different types of law including administrative and property law,simple
tort law helps people to make claims for compensation repayment when someone hurts them or hurts their property,simple
criminal law is used by the government to prevent people from breaking laws and punish people who do break them,simple
constitutional law deals with the important rights of the government and its relationship with the people,simple
it mainly involves the interpretation of a constitution including things like the separation of powers of the different branches of government,simple
a court order is an official proclamation by a judge that defines and authorizes the carrying out of certain steps for one or more parties to a case,simple
administrative law is used by ordinary citizens who want to challenge decisions made by governments,simple
it also involves things like regulations and the operation of the administrative agencies,simple
international law is used to set out rules on how countries can act in areas such as trade the environment or military action,simple
the geneva conventions on the conduct of war and the roerich pact are examples of international law,simple
custom and tradition are practices that are widely adopted and agreed upon in a society thought often not in a written form,simple
custom and tradition can be enforced in courts and are sometimes considered as part of the legal reasoning in matters decided in courts,simple
in some societies and cultures all law is or was custom and tradition though this is increasingly rare although there are some parts of the world where custom tradition are still binding or even the predominant form of law for example tribal lands or failed states,simple
civil law is the legal system used in most countries around the world today,simple
civil law is based on legislation that is found in constitutions or statutes passed by government,simple
the secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom,simple
in civil law governments judges do not generally have much power and most of the laws and legal precedent are created by members of parliament,simple
common law is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases,simple
it comes from england and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to the british empire except malta scotland the u,simple
state of louisiana and the canadian province of quebec,simple
it is also the predominant form of law in the united states where many laws called statutes are written by congress but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts,simple
common law had its beginnings in the middle ages when king john was forced by his barons to sign a document called the magna carta,simple
religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books,simple
examples include the jewish halakha islamic sharia and christian canon law,simple
until the s sharia law was the main legal system throughout the muslim world,simple
in some muslim countries such as saudi arabia and iran the whole legal systems still base their law on sharia law,simple
islamic law is often criticised because it often has harsh penalties for crimes,simple
a serious criticism is the judgement of the european court that sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of democracy,simple
the turkish refah party 's sharia-based plurality of legal systems grounded on religion was ruled to contravene the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms,simple
the court decided refah 's plan would do away with the state 's role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms and infringe the principle of non-discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy,simple
the history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilizations,simple
ancient egyptian law developed in bc,simple
in bc king hammurabi took ancient babylonian law and organized it and had it chiseled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace,simple
these laws became known as the code of hammurabi,simple
the torah from the old testament is an old body of law,simple
it was written around bc,simple
it has moral rules such as the ten commandments which tell people what things are not permitted,simple
sometimes people try to change the law,simple
for example if prostitution is illegal they try to make it legal,simple
in democracies the people in a country usually choose people called politicians to represent them in a legislature,simple
examples of legislatures include the houses of parliament in london the congress in washington d,simple
c,simple
the bundestag in berlin the duma in moscow and the assemblée nationale in paris,simple
most legislatures have two chambers or houses a 'lower house ' and an 'upper house ',simple
to pass legislation a majority of members of parliament must vote for a bill in each house,simple
the legislature is the branch of government that writes laws and votes on whether they will be approved,simple
the judiciary is a group of judges who resolve people 's disputes and determine whether people who are charged with crimes are guilty,simple
in some jurisdictions the judge does not find guilt or innocence but instead directs a jury how to interpret facts from a legal perspective but the jury determines the facts based on evidence presented to them and finds the guilt or innocences of the charged person,simple
most countries of common law and civil law systems have a system of appeals courts up to a supreme authority such as the supreme court or the high court,simple
the highest courts usually have the power to remove laws that are unconstitutional which go against the constitution,simple
the executive is the governing center of political authority,simple
in most democratic countries the executive is elected from people who are in the legislature,simple
this group of elected people is called the cabinet,simple
in france the us and russia the executive branch has a president which exists separately from the legislature,simple
the executive suggests new laws and deals with other countries,simple
as well the executive usually controls the military the police and the bureaucracy,simple
the executive selects ministers or secretaries of state to control departments such as the health department or the department of justice,simple
in many jurisdictions the head of state does not take part in the day-to-day governance of the jurisdiction and takes a largely ceremonial role,simple
this is the case in many commonwealth nations where the head of state usually a governor almost exclusively acts on the advice of the head of the executive e,simple
g,simple
the prime minister first minister or premier,simple
the primary legal role of the head of state in these jurisdictions is to act as a check or balance against the executive as the head of state has the rarely exercised power to dissolve the legislature call elections and dismiss ministers,simple
the police enforce the criminal laws by arresting people suspected of breaking the law,simple
bureaucrats are the government workers and government organizations that do work for the government,simple
bureaucrats work within a system of rules and they make their decisions in writing,simple
lawyers are people who have learned about laws,simple
lawyers give people advice about their legal rights and duties and represent people in court,simple
to become a lawyer a person has to complete a two- or three-year university program at a law school and pass an entrance examination,simple
lawyers work in law firms for the government for companies or by themselves,simple
civil society is the people and groups that are not part of government that try to protect people against human rights abuses and try to protect freedom of speech and other individual rights,simple
organizations that are part of civil society include political parties debating clubs trade unions human rights organizations newspapers and charities,simple
corporations are among the organizations that use the legal system to further their goals,simple
like the others they use means such as campaign donations and advertising to persuade people that they are right,simple
corporations also engage in commerce and make new things such as automobiles vaporisers/e-cigarettes and unmanned aerial vehicles i,simple
e,simple
drones that the old laws are not well equipped to deal with,simple
corporations also makes use of a set of rules and regulations to ensure their employees remain loyal to them usually presented in a legal contract and that any disobedience towards these rules are considered uncivilized and therefore given grounds for immediate dismissal,simple
constitution ethics legal rights parliament physical law political economy,simple
plato listed five kinds of government in the republic :,simple
the most common type of government in the western world is called democracy,simple
in democracies people in a country can vote during elections for representatives or political parties that they prefer,simple
the people in democracies can elect representatives who will sit on legislatures such as the parliament or congress,simple
political parties are organizations of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed,simple
different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems,simple
democracy is the government of the people by the people and for the people,simple
however many countries have forms of democracy which limit freedom of choice by the voters,simple
one of the most common ways is to limit which parties who can for parliament or limit the parties access to mass media such as television,simple
another way is to rig the voting system by removing votes from opposition voters and substituting votes for the party in power,simple
few countries are textbook democracies and the differences between them has been much studied,simple
a monarchy is a government ruled by a king or a queen who inherits their position from their family which is often called the royal family,simple
there are two types of monarchies : absolute monarchies and constitutional monarchies,simple
in an absolute monarchy the ruler has no limits on their wishes or powers,simple
in a constitutional monarchy a ruler 's powers are limited by a document called a constitution,simple
in modern times monarchies still exist in great britain and the commonwealth the netherlands spain japan saudi arabia and thailand along with several other countries,simple
a monarch may have one of several titles : king or queen emperor or empress or emir,simple
an aristocracy is a government by the best people usually people who come from wealthy families families with a particular set of values or people who come from a particular place,simple
a person who rules in an aristocracy is an aristocrat,simple
aristocracy is different from nobility in that nobility means that one bloodline would rule an aristocracy would mean that a few or many bloodlines would rule or that rulers be chosen in a different manner,simple
under a dictatorship the government is run by one person who has all the power over the people in a country,simple
originally the roman republic made dictators to lead during time of war,simple
the roman dictators and greek tyrants were not always cruel or unkind but they did hold on to power all by themselves rather than sharing power with the people,simple
the roman dictators only held power for a short period of time,simple
in modern times a dictator 's rule is not stopped by any laws constitutions or other social and political institutions and can last many years or even decades,simple
after world war ii many governments in latin america asia and africa were ruled by dictators,simple
examples of dictators include josef stalin adolf hitler augusto pinochet idi amin muammar al-qaddafi and gamal abdul nasser,simple
the rules of these dictators continued from when they took power until when they died because they would not allow any other person or law to take power from them,simple
there is no evidence of a woman serving as a dictator in modern times,simple
an oligarchy is a government ruled by a small group of powerful people,simple
these people may spread power equally or not equally,simple
an oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things,simple
an oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or passed down from father to son,simple
an oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several powerful people,simple
some past examples of oligarchy are the former union of soviet socialist republics and apartheid south africa,simple
a fictional example is the dystopian society of oceania in the book nineteen eighty-four,simple
some critics of representative democracy think of the united states as an oligarchy,simple
this view is shared by anarchists,simple
the simplest idea of government is those who rule over people and land,simple
this may be as small as a community or village or as big as a continent like australia and india,simple
the people who rule can allow others to own land,simple
it is a deed by government that gives this right in the way that laws describe,simple
some think they have the right to hold land without government permission,simple
this view is called libertarianism,simple
others think they can do without government,simple
this view is called anarchism,simple
almost every place on earth is connected to one and only one government,simple
places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules small border disputed areas and the continent of antarctica because almost no people live there,simple
for every other place on earth there is a government that claims 'sovereign control ' over it,simple
the word sovereign is old and means control by a king sovereign,simple
governments of villages cities counties and other communities are subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist and then to that of the country,simple
it is from kings and feudalism that modern governments and nation states came,simple
the capital of a country for instance is where the king kept his assets,simple
from this we get the modern idea of capital in economics,simple
a government may regulate trade as well as to rule over land,simple
governments also control people and decide things about what morality to accept or punish,simple
in many countries there are strict rules about sexual intercourse and drugs which are part of law and offenders are punished for disobeying them,simple
tax is how government is paid for in most countries,simple
people who buy sell import invest own a house or land or earn money are made to pay some of the money to a government,simple
there are many theories of how to organize government better,simple
these are called theories of civics,simple
many people think leaders must be elected by some kind of democracy,simple
that way they can be replaced at election,simple
many governments are not a democracy but other forms in which only a few people have power,simple
there are many theories of how to run a government better and keep people from hurting each other,simple
these theories are part of politics,simple
constitution constitutional economics law legal rights political economy local government == references ==,simple
prisons are usually surrounded by walls and gates,simple
there are usually many locked gates inside the prison to control the inmates,simple
the inmates sleep in small locked rooms called cells,simple
cells have a bunk bed a toilet and a sink,simple
inmates are allowed to leave their cell every day for exercise,simple
some inmates work in the prison during the day either in a factory or doing cooking or cleaning,simple
law enforcement officers called prison guards watch the inmates,simple
the manager of a prison is called the warden us canada superintendent some parts of the us india or governor uk australia,simple
prisons usually also include other buildings and facilities such as a chapel a library an exercise yard a gymnasium an infirmary small hospital visiting rooms for visits from family and lawyers kitchens and accommodation for prison staff,simple
the level of security a prison has depends on the type of prison,simple
a maximum security prison has even more protection than a regular prison,simple
some prisons in the united states have a section called death row where people who have been sentenced to death are kept in prison until their execution,simple
on the other hand an open prison is a prison where inmates can often travel out of the prison,simple
these are used for prisoners who have been convicted of minor crimes or who will soon be released,simple
the united nations made the standard minimum rule for human treatment for prisoners in,simple
also the article of international covenant on civil and political rights also affirm the treatment with humanity for them in prison,simple
in some prisons people imprisoned for child sexual abuse are separated from other prisoners for their own safety,simple
there are four main ideas about what prisons should be used for : rehabilitation : prisons should be places that turn the prisoners into good people,simple
deterrence : people should be scared by the thought of going to prison so they will not want to commit crimes,simple
incapacitation : locking criminals up stops them from committing more crimes,simple
retribution : by forcing them to spend time in prison society is taking revenge against people who break the law,simple
a person who has been charged with a crime but has not yet been convicted for it in a court may be sent to prison if : the court thinks that the person may not come to their trial the court thinks that the person may be a danger to the community or mainly in the us the court has asked for bail money but the person can not pay the amount,simple
in some parts of the us a person who is arrested may be held at a county jail until they decide whether to charge or release the person,simple
in other places a person who is arrested will be held at a police station not a prison,simple
male and female inmates are usually kept in separate locations and often in separate prisons,simple
there are special prisons for people under the age of who commit crimes,simple
these inmates are called young offenders or juvenile offenders,simple
these places will not always have the word prison in their name instead having names like young offenders ' institution,simple
prisons are a controversial topic that people have different views about,simple
people who think that we should have prisons say that removing people who commit crimes from society prevents them from committing more crimes and punishes them for their behavior,simple
they also say that putting people in prison may also prevent others who are likely to commit similar crimes from committing them,simple
people who think that we should not put people in prisons say that being put in prison makes people more violent and angry,simple
people who commit minor crimes that are sent to prison meet violent criminals,simple
as well when people are sent to prison they can not see their family or children which can cause problems for their family,simple
sometimes people are put in prison who have done nothing wrong,simple
an american theory that is critical of prisons is called the prison industrial complex,simple
people who believe in the prison industrial complex think that private prison companies want lots of people to be put in prison in order to make money,simple
as of there are currently nine million people in prison in the world,simple
the united states currently has the most people in prison it has more than million people in prison,simple
in both russia and china also had over million people in prison,simple
in the united kingdom had people in prison france and germany had a similar number of people in prison,simple

a disease can be caused by many things,simple
sometimes germs enter our body through food water or air,simple
a person can be infected by infectious agents like bacteria viruses or fungus,simple
disease can also be caused by eating bad or old foods,simple
there are small germs in old foods that can cause diseases,simple
sometimes the germs produce chemicals or toxins which causes the disease,simple
one of the most common causes of disease is poor sanitation and lack of clean water,simple
some deadly diseases like malaria in tropical parts of the world are spread by a mosquito,simple
animals that spread disease are called vectors,simple
there are many vectors including snails ticks and fleas,simple
some people are born with 'genetic diseases ',simple
these are diseases because of an error or mutation in a person 's dna,simple
an example of a mutation is cancer,simple
living or working in an unhealthy environment can also be a cause for diseases,simple
diseases are more common in older people,simple
some diseases can be helped with medicine,simple
infections can often be cured by antibiotics though resistance to antibiotics is a problem,simple
some disease may be helped by surgery,simple
not every disease can be helped with medicine or surgery though,simple
some diseases must be treated during the whole life they are chronic long-lasting diseases,simple
an example of a chronic disease is diabetes mellitus,simple
diabetes can be treated made better but it can not yet be cured made to totally go away,simple
people who usually treat diseases are called doctors or physicians,simple
some diseases that are common or very bad are tested for even in people who are healthy,simple
if these diseases are found early they can be treated before they cause problems,simple
an example would be checking a woman for cervical cancer with a test called a pap smear,simple
if cervical cancer is found early it can be cured,simple
if it is found later it usually causes death,simple
another example is immunization,simple
the basic of it is to make the body ready for a disease,simple
the body has its own defense against disease called the immune system,simple
one special characteristic of the immune system is its ability to remember,simple
if a person had been sick before and had recovered the immune system produce a substance called antibodies which fight the disease if it comes back to the person,simple
the antibody is specific to a particular disease or antigen,simple
an example of this is measles which is a virus,simple
a person usually a child who had never been sick with measles is given a milder form of the virus this cause the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus,simple
if this person is exposed to the same virus in the future the person 's immune system will remember and will fight the virus,simple
for general prevention to be useful : the disease must be found and stopped in early stage,simple
the disease should be common or be easy to recognize,simple
the test for the disease should be easy work all the time and not hurt people,simple
the society is well-trained and can recognize most common symptoms on some diseases,simple
the treatment for the disease should be safe and be easy for people to get,simple
epidemiology is the study of the cause of disease,simple
some diseases are more popular for people with common characteristics like similar origins sociological background food or nationality,simple
without good epidemiological research some diseases can be hard to track and to name,simple
some diseases can be taken for something else,simple
this is why epidemiology takes a huge part in understanding how to protect ourselves against viruses toxins and bacteria,simple

there is no easy way to be sure when clothing was first developed because it was prehistoric and clothing is perishable,simple
some information comes from studying lice,simple
the body louse lives in clothing and diverged from head lice about years ago,simple

the byzantine empire controlled asia minor and northern africa and sometimes southern spain and southern italy but its lands were slowly eaten away by enemies like the turks and the franks,simple
as a walled city on a peninsula the city of constantinople was difficult to attack,simple
the ottoman turks eventually seized constantinople in,simple
they called the city by its present-day name istanbul,simple
the fall of constantinople is sometimes called the end of the middle age,simple
islam was founded in the early th century by the islamic prophet muhammad,simple
muslims believe that the qur'an is god 's ultimate revelation to mankind,simple
islam spread quickly through warfare and along the major trade routes of the old world finding appeal with traders and travellers,simple
the islamic religion soon split between the sunni muslims and the shi'a,simple
the sunni religion is the majority roughly of muslims belong to this sect most shi'a live in modern-day iran and iraq,simple
the sunni-shi'a split has been compared to the catholic-eastern orthodox split of the christian church much later in,simple
muslims quickly conquered the christian countries of iraq syria egypt north africa and spain,simple
the christians were able to keep france and other european countries,simple
later muslims took other countries such as persia and india where they built the mughal empire,simple
the muslim ottoman empire eventually conquered parts of eastern europe,simple
the muslims took hold of vast areas of land making them a superpower of the middle ages,simple
during the early middle ages muslims achieved what is remembered as a golden age of knowledge,simple
during these times of strife in europe muslim caliphs gathered the ancient texts of the great empires rome greece egypt and attempted to re-integrate that knowledge,simple
during this time a persian muslim helped develop progress in algebra,simple
the golden age of islam ended with the ottoman invasions in the th century,simple
during the middle ages trade between countries became much more common,simple
it was mostly through the middle eastern / asian trade route known as the silk road,simple
arabs served as the middle men in international trade,simple
trade in this time was based on how valuable the item was,simple
the items that had higher value and low weight travelled the farthest gold silk etc,simple
and items that were heavier and worth less would travel mostly short distances,simple
food for example would mostly travel only within a few villages,simple
during the high middle ages wealth began to return and consumers began to demand luxuries again,simple
silk porcelain spices incense gold and gems all travelled thousands of miles across deserts mountains and plains,simple
glass was in turn imported from europe to east,simple
trade was greatly interrupted several times during the crusades - due to the aggression between muslims and europeans and because of mongolian invasions and later because of the black plague,simple
it is thought that the mongols brought the plague with them from asia and devastated the world population from -,simple
almost a third of the world 's population was killed by the plague at this time although the americas were not touched by the disease at all,simple
buddhism is a non-theistic religion in other words buddhists do n't believe in a god that is based on philosophy,simple

they think several million species exist but they have only identified about one million,simple
animals can mainly be divided into two main groups : the invertebrates and the vertebrates,simple
vertebrates have a backbone or spine invertebrates do not,simple
vertebrates are : fish or 'fishes ' : both ways are correct amphibians reptiles birds mammalssome invertebrates are : insects spiders crustaceans molluscs like a snail or squid worms jellyfishin scientific usage humans are considered animals in everyday nonscientific usage humans are often not considered to be animals,simple
the animal mode of nutrition is called heterotrophic because they get their food from other living organisms,simple
some animals eat only plants they are called herbivores,simple
other animals eat only meat and are called carnivores,simple
animals that eat both plants and meat are called omnivores,simple
the environments animals live in vary greatly,simple
by the process of evolution animals adapt to the habitats they live in,simple
a fish is adapted to its life in water and a spider is adapted to a life catching and eating insects,simple
a mammal living on the savannahs of east africa lives quite a different life from a sea mammal like a dolphin or porpoise catching fish in the sea,simple
the fossil record of animals goes back about million years to the ediacaran period or somewhat earlier,simple
during the whole of this long time animals have been constantly evolving so that the animals alive on earth today are very different from those on the edges of the sea-floor in the ediacaran,simple
the study of ancient life is called palaeontology,simple

in fiction there are always characters,simple
there is usually a protagonist or hero,simple
sometimes this is a group of people not one person,simple
you usually support the hero or heroes,simple
the protagonist has to face some kind of enemy usually another character called the antagonist,simple
the fight between the protagonist and their enemy is called the conflict,simple
plot is a literary term,simple
it is the events that make up a story particularly as they relate to one another,simple
the events may form a pattern,simple
that pattern may be a sequence through cause and effect or how the reader views the story or simply by coincidence,simple
in his poetics aristotle considered plot mythos the most important element of drama—more important than character for example,simple
a plot must have aristotle says a beginning a middle and an end and the events of the plot must causally relate to one another as being either necessary or probable,simple
of the utmost importance to aristotle is the plot 's ability to arouse emotion in the psyche of the audience,simple
in tragedy the emotions are fear and pity emotions which he considers in his rhetoric,simple
gustav freytag considered plot a narrative structure that divided a story into five parts like the five acts of a play,simple
these parts are : exposition of the situation rising action through conflict climax or turning point falling action and resolution,simple
the climax is the most dangerous and exciting part of the plot,simple
for example if you were on a rollercoaster the highest part would be the climax,simple
the climax usually near to the end of the story because the whole story has been building up to it rising action,simple
in an action drama it is the point when the hero or heroine looks like s/he is about to lose and is in the greatest danger,simple
conflict is very important in fiction,simple
every work of fiction needs a conflict or problem,simple
there are five basic types of conflict,simple
in modern times a new one person vs,simple
technology has been used,simple
person vs,simple
self is when a character is facing his own fears confusion or philosophy,simple
sometimes the character tries to find out who he or she is and comes to realize it or change it,simple
sometimes the character struggles to find out what is right or wrong,simple
although the enemy is inside the character they can be influenced by outside forces,simple
the struggle of the human being to come to a decision is the base of this type of conflict,simple
person vs,simple
person is when the hero is fighting another person,simple
there is usually more than one time that the hero meets the enemy,simple
for example if a child is being bullied that is person vs,simple
person conflict,simple
an example is the conflict between judah and messala in ben-hur,simple
person vs,simple
society is when the hero 's main source of conflict is traditions or ideas,simple
the protagonist is basically fighting what is wrong with the world he lives in,simple
society itself is often treated as a single character just as another person is in person vs,simple
person conflict,simple
an example in literature would be wuthering heights by emily brontë,simple
person vs,simple
nature is when a character is fighting against forces of nature,simple
many films focus on this theme,simple
it is also found in stories about trying to survive in places far away from humans like jack london 's short story to build a fire,simple
person vs,simple
supernatural is when a character is battling supernatural forces,simple
sometimes this force is inside themselves it is internal,simple
such stories are sometimes used to represent or criticize freud 's theory of id vs,simple
superego,simple
bram stoker 's dracula is a good example of this as well as frankenstein by mary shelley and christabel by samuel coleridge,simple
it is also very common in comic books,simple
person vs,simple
machine/technology places a character against robot forces with artificial intelligence,simple
i robot and the terminator series are good examples of this conflict,simple

they are then put on the shelf in number order,simple
one number system used by many libraries is the dewey decimal system,simple
many colleges and universities have large academic libraries,simple
these libraries are for the use of college students professors and researchers,simple

for example disney world in orlando has its own library that is not open to the public but for the use of the people who work for the company,simple
a librarian is a person who works in a library,simple
librarians help people find books and information,simple
they can teach people how to find books and use the library,simple
a professional librarian is a person who went to school to study library science,simple
they can earn a degree called a masters in library science,simple
the earliest known library was discovered in iraq and belonged to the ancient civilization in sumer,simple
they did n't use paper books but instead wrote everything on clay tablets using a style of writing called cuneiform,simple
these tablets are over years old,simple
the library of alexandria in egypt was the largest and most important library of the ancient world,simple
it was destroyed when the romans conquered egypt in bc,simple
rome ’ s first public library was established by asinius pollio who was a lieutenant of julius caesar,simple
eventually rome would build public libraries within the city,simple
when the roman empire fell in ad many books went east to the city of byzantium where a large library was built,simple
other libraries were built in monasteries and public homes,simple
libraries began to appear in many islamic cities where science and philosophy survived after the fall of the roman empire,simple
surprisingly christian monks and islamic libraries exchanged books to copy,simple
these books eventually made there way,simple
ludwig wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to address the definition of the word game,simple
in his philosophical investigations wittgenstein demonstrated that the elements parts of games such as play rules and competition all fail to correctly define what games are,simple
he concluded that people apply the term game to a range of different human activities that are only related a little bit,simple
french sociologist roger caillois in his book les jeux et les hommes games and men said that a game is an activity which is these things : fun : the activity is fun to do separate : the activity can not happen everywhere or all the time uncertain : the people doing the activity do not know how it will end non-productive : doing the activity does not make or do anything useful governed by rules : the activity has rules that are different from everyday life fictitious : the people doing the activity know that the game is not reality,simple
computer game designer chris crawford tried to define the word game using a series of comparisons : something creative is art if it was made because it is beautiful and entertainment if it was made for money,simple
this is the least rigid of his definitions,simple
crawford acknowledges that he often chooses a creative path over conventional business wisdom which is why only one of his games is a sequel,simple
something that is entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive,simple
movies and books are entertainment but not interactive,simple
if a plaything does not have any goals to complete it is a toy,simple
crawford notes that by his definition a a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules and b the sims and simcity are toys not games,simple
if a plaything has goals it is a challenge,simple
if a challenge does not have an enemy it is a puzzle,simple
if it has an enemy or enemies it is a conflict,simple
crawford admits that this is a subjective test,simple
video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in pac-man,simple
if the player can only do better at something than an enemy and can not hurt the enemy or slow him down the conflict is a competition,simple
racing and figure skating are competitions,simple
however if attacks are allowed then the conflict qualifies as a game,simple
crawford 's definition of a game is : an interactive goal-oriented activity with enemies to play against and where players and enemies can interfere with each other,simple
homo ludens playing man is a book written in by dutch historian johan huizinga,simple
it discusses the importance of the play element in culture and society,simple
huizinga suggests that play is a condition for the generation of culture,simple
the first writer of history was herodotus an ancient greek,simple
he wrote a book called “ the histories ” around bc which is nearly years ago,simple
some of the stories he wrote were not true and we do n't know if this is one of those,simple
herodotus tells us about king atys he ruled about [ five thousand five hundred ] years ago in a country called lydia,simple
his country was in western asia minor near modern greece,simple
atys had a serious problem his lands had very little food because the climate was not good for agriculture,simple
the people of lydia demonstrated patience and hoped that the good times of plenty would return,simple
but when things failed to get better the people of lydia thought up a strange solution for their problem,simple
the path they took to fight their natural need to eat – the hungry times caused by the unusually hard climate - was to play games for one entire day so that they would not think about food,simple
on the next day they would eat so eating occurred every second day,simple
in this way they passed years and in that time they invented dice balls and all the games commonly played today,simple
games appear in all cultures all over the world an ancient custom that brings people together for social opportunities,simple
games allow people to go beyond the limit of the immediate physical experience to use their imagination,simple
common features of games include a finish that you can not forecast agreed upon rules competition separate place and time imaginary elements elements of chance established goals and personal enjoyment,simple
games are used to teach to build friendships and to indicate status,simple
in his history book the dutch writer johan huizinga says that games are older than human culture,simple
he sees games as the beginning of complex human activities such as language law war philosophy and art,simple
ancient people used bones to make the first games,simple
dice are very early game pieces,simple
games began as part of ancient religions,simple
the oldest gaming pieces ever found – [ forty nine ] small painted stones with pictures cut into them from [ five thousand ] years ago – come from turkey so perhaps the history of herodotus is true,simple
one of the first board games senet appears in ancient egypt around [ three thousand five hundred ] years ago,simple
the ancient greeks had a board game similar to checkers and also many ball games,simple
the first reference to the game of go occurs in chinese records from around [ two thousand four hundred ] years ago,simple
originally the game go was used by political leaders to develop skill in strategy and mental skill,simple
knowing how to play go was required by a chinese gentleman along with the skills of artistic writing or calligraphy painting and the ability to play a musical instrument,simple
these were regarded as the four most important skills,simple
in ancient china a gentleman had to pass a test in these four key skills in order to get a good paying job in the government,simple
the chinese brought go to korea and it entered japan around [ one thousand five hundred ] years ago and it has been popular ever since,simple
in march of a google computer program beat the best go players in the world,simple
go is believed to be the most complex board game ever created,simple
is this computer program smarter than a person ? well it did beat the south korean go master lee se-dol and lee was surprised by the result,simple
he acknowledged defeat after three and a half hours of play,simple
demis hassabis who made the google program called it an important moment in history because a machine beat the best person in the world in an intelligent game,simple
such computer programs rely on what is called artificial intelligence,simple
go is a two-player game of strategy said to have had an origin in china perhaps around [ three thousand ] years ago,simple
players compete to win more territory by placing black and white “ stones ” on a board made up of [ nineteen ] lines by [ nineteen ] lines,simple
the first computer game that was ever created was probably the game oxo by alexander douglas in,simple
it was a version of tic-tac-toe,simple
but most people consider the first true computer game where players actually participate to be tennis for two developed in by the physics scientist william higginbotham,simple
he wanted to teach about gravity the force of attraction between masses,simple
these men who created the early computer games did not forecast the potential for the popular use of games because at that period in modern history it took a small room full of computers to make these games work another early game was spacewar developed in by mit university student steve russell,simple
in the company atari produced the pong game which was a huge commercial success being a commercial success means that it made a lot of money,simple
this was the true beginning of computer games that could be played at home,simple
today all around the world people spend more the [ three billion ] hours a week playing computer games,simple
this is equivalent to more than [ three hundred and forty two hundred thousand ] years,simple
a game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict defined by rules that results in a quantifiable outcome,simple
katie salen and eric zimmerman a game is a form of art in which participants termed players make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal,simple
greg costikyan a game is an activity among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context,simple

abt at its most elementary level then we can define game as an exercise of voluntary control systems in which there is an opposition between forces confined by a procedure and rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome,simple

a fifth of the journeys in the town is made by bike,simple
students are also not allowed to drive a car while they are in cambridge,simple
local people from cambridge do n't always like the students,simple
town and gown is a phrase to talk about this relationship,simple
town means the cambridge locals while gown means the students and teachers from the type of dress they wear,simple
since the university began there have been some fights between the two groups,simple
in many things were stolen from the university and the colleges,simple
the chancellor was then given extra power to control order in the town,simple
when the plague arrived in cambridge in many colleges closed up,simple
they did not want to help the locals who had the disease,simple
however more recently there have been fewer fights,simple

,simple
one of the main aims of the university of cambridge is to do scientific research,simple
all the departments are always studying and discovering new things,simple
many important people have done research in cambridge,simple
this is because the university has a lot of money and resources like laboratories and books,simple
it had £,simple
m in to spend on research this was mainly given by the uk government and the european commission,simple
students need to pass some tests and interviews to be allowed in cambridge,simple
for undergraduates the application is done through ucas,simple
this is as with any other university in the uk,simple
students need to be very good to enter cambridge,simple
if they study a-levels they are asked to get at least aaa,simple
because many good students apply the interview is very important to choose the best ones,simple
these are done by fellows,simple
usually about of the applicants get a place,simple
however the number changes depending on the subjects,simple
some of them like medicine and economics are very hard to get into,simple
students need to choose a college before doing the application,simple
they may later have to change it if the college thinks they are good but does not have enough places for them,simple
for postgraduates the application is different,simple
they need to ask professors teachers in the departments they want to work in,simple
after an interview they can be given a place,simple
they then have to get some funding money to do the project,simple
this can be given from a government or another institution,simple
some people think that admission at cambridge is not very fair,simple
this is because it is easier to get in if you go to a private school instead of a state school,simple
in - only of students who got a place were coming from state school,simple
however about of british children go to them,simple
if a student goes to a private school he/she is also more likely to get a place after the interview,simple
in only of students that applied from state school got a place while the percentage was for private school students,simple
the university is trying to make things better by making the admission process easier and giving scholarships for the poorer students,simple
another problem is that year after year there are also fewer people from state schools applying,simple
