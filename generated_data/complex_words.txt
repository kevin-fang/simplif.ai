several
outside

lifestyle

have
raised
serious
concerns
about

trump
is
the
beneficiary
of

received
annual
payments
from
his

fund
for
example
in

in
by
when

he
began
his
career
with
a
small
loan
of

million
dollars
from
his
father
and
that
he
had
to
pay
it
back
with
interest
in

the
new
york
times
published
an
exposé
drawing
on
more
than
pages
of
tax
returns
and
financial
records
from
fred
trump's
businesses
and
interviews
with
former
advisers
and
employees
the

concluded
that
donald

was
a
millionaire
by
age
and
that
he
had
received
at
least
million
adjusted
for
inflation
from
his
father's
business
empire
over
his
lifetime
according
to
the
times
trump
borrowed
at
least
million
from
his
father
and
largely
failed
to
reimburse
him
the
paper
also
described
a
number
of
purportedly
fraudulent
tax
schemes
for
example
when
fred
trump
sold
shares
in
trump
palace
condos
to
his
son
well
below
their
purchase
price
thus
masking
what
could
be
considered
a
hidden
donation
and
benefiting
from
a
tax
write-off
a
lawyer
for
trump
said
the
allegations
of
fraud
and
tax
evasion
are
percent
false
and
highly
defamatory
a
spokesman
for
the
new
york
state
tax
department
said
the
agency
was
vigorously
pursuing
all
appropriate
areas
of
investigation
new
york
city
officials
also
indicated
they
are
examining
the
matter
trump
appeared
on
the
initial
forbes
list
of
richest
americans
in
with
an
estimated
million
fortune
shared
with
his
father
former
forbes
reporter
jonathan
greenberg
stated
in
that
during
the
trump
had
deceived
him
about
his
actual
net
worth
and
his
share
of
the
family
assets
in
order
to
appear
on
the
list
trump
made
the
forbes
world's
billionaires
list
for
the
first
time
in
but
he
was
dropped
from
the
forbes
from
to
following
business
losses
in
deutsche
bank
loan
documents
pegged
trump's
net
worth
at
million
while
forbes
quoted
billion
and
journalist
tim
o'brien
gave
a
range
of
million
to
million
in
its
billionaires
ranking
forbes
estimated
trump's
net
worth
at
billion
th
in
the
world
th
in
the
making
him
one
of
the
richest
politicians
in
american
history
during
the
three
years
since
trump
announced
his
presidential
run
in
forbes
estimated
his
net
worth
declined
and
his
ranking
fell
spots
when
he
filed
mandatory
financial
disclosure
forms
with
the
federal
elections
commission
fec
in
july
trump
claimed
a
net
worth
of
about
billion
however
fec
figures
cannot
corroborate
this
estimate
because
they
only
show
each
of
his
largest
buildings
as
being
worth
over
million
yielding
total
assets
worth
more
than
billion
and
debt
over
million
trump
reported
a
yearly
income
of
million
for
and
million
from
january
to
may
a
analysis
of
trump's
business
career
in
the
economist
concluded
that
his
performance
since
had
been
mediocre
compared
with
the
stock
market
and
property
in
new
york
a
subsequent
analysis
in
the
washington
post
similarly
noted
that
trump's
estimated
net
worth
of
million
in
would
have
increased
to
billion
by
if
he
had
invested
it
in
a
typical
retirement
fund
and
concluded
that
trump
is
a
mix
of
braggadocio
business
failures
and
real
success
trump
stated
in
a
deposition
my
net
worth
fluctuates
and
it
goes
up
and
down
with
markets
and
with
attitudes
and
with
feelings
even
my
own
feelings
in
trump
began
his
career
at
his
father
fred's
real
estate
development
company
e
trump
son
which
among
other
interests
owned
middle-class
rental
housing
in

worked
for
his
father
to
revitalize
the
swifton
village
apartment
complex
in
cincinnati
ohio
which
the
elder
trump
had
bought
in
the
management
of
the
property
was
sued
for
racial
discrimination
in
the
suit
was
quietly
settled
at
fred
trump's
direction
the
trumps
sold
the
property
in
with
vacancy
on
the
rise
when
his
father
became
chairman
of
the

was
promoted
to
president
of
the
company
and
renamed
it
the
trump
organization
in
he
and
his
father
drew
wider
attention
when
the
justice
department
contended
in
a
lawsuit
that
their
company
systematically
discriminated
against
african
americans
who
wished
to
rent
apartments
the
department
alleged
that
the
trump
organization
had
screened
out
people
based
on
race
and
not
low
income
as
the
trumps
had
stated
under
an
agreement
reached
in
the
trumps
made
no
admission
of
wrongdoing
and
made
the
urban
league
an
intermediary
for
qualified
minority
applicants
trump's
attorney
at
the
time
was
roy
cohn
who
valued
both
positive
and
negative
publicity
and
responded
to
attacks
with
forceful
counterattacks
trump
later
emulated
cohn's
style
in
trump
launched
his
manhattan

estate
business
by
purchasing
a
percent
stake
in
the
derelict
commodore
hotel
located
next
to

the
purchase
was
funded
largely
by
a
million
construction
loan
that
was
guaranteed
jointly
by
fred
trump
and
the
hyatt
hotel
chain
when
the
remodeling
was
finished

received
another

in

was
extended
until
according
to
journalist
joyce
purnick
trump's
wollman

also
the

carefully
crafted
self-promotional
legend
while

in

trump
called
numerous
press
conferences
for

obama
is
a
protestant
christian
whose
religious
views
developed
in
his
adult
life
he
wrote
in
the
audacity
of
hope
that
he
was
not
raised
in
a
religious
household
he
described
his
mother
raised
by
non-religious
parents
as
being
detached
from
religion
yet
in
many
ways
the
most
spiritually
awakened
person
that
i
have
ever
known
he
described
his
father
as
a
confirmed
atheist
by
the
time
his
parents
met
and
his
stepfather
as
a
man
who
saw
religion
as
not
particularly
useful
obama
explained
how
through
working
with
black
churches
as
a
community
organizer
while
in
his
twenties
he
came
to
understand
the
power
of
the
african-american
religious
tradition
to
spur
social
change
in
january
obama
told
christianity
today:
i
am
a
christian
and
i
am
a
devout
christian
i
believe
in
the
redemptive
death
and
resurrection
of
jesus
christ
i
believe
that
faith
gives
me
a
path
to
be
cleansed
of
sin
and
have
eternal
life
on
september
obama
released
a
statement
commenting
on
his
religious
views
saying
i'm
a
christian
by
choice
my
family
didn't
–
frankly
they
weren't
folks
who
went
to
church
every
week
and
my
mother
was
one
of
the
most
spiritual
people
i
knew
but
she
didn't
raise
me
in
the
church
so
i
came
to
my
christian
faith
later
in
life
and
it
was
because
the
precepts
of
jesus
christ
spoke
to
me
in
terms
of
the
kind
of
youtube
was
founded
by
chad
hurley
steve
chen
and
jawed
karim
who
were
all
early
employees
of
paypal
hurley
had
studied
design
at
indiana
university
of
pennsylvania
and
chen
and
karim
studied
computer
science
together
at
the
university
of
illinois
at
urbana-champaign
according
to
a
story
that
has
often
been
repeated
in
the
media
hurley
and
chen
developed
the
idea
for
youtube
during
the
early
months
of
after
they
had
experienced
difficulty
sharing
videos
that
had
been
shot
at
a
dinner
party
at
chen's
apartment
in
san
francisco
karim
did
not
attend
the
party
and
denied
that
it
had
occurred
but
chen
commented
that
the
idea
that
youtube
was
founded
after
a
dinner
party
was
probably
very
strengthened
by
marketing
ideas
around
creating
a
story
that
was
very
digestible
karim
said
the
inspiration
for
youtube
first
came
from
janet
jackson's
role
in
the
super
bowl
incident
when
her
breast
was
exposed
during
her
performance
and
later
from
the
indian
ocean
tsunami
karim
could
not
easily
find
video
clips
of
either
event
online
which
led
to
the
idea
of
a
video
sharing
site
hurley
and
chen
said
that
the
original
idea
for
youtube
was
a
video
version
of
an
online
dating
service

had
been
influenced
by

in
general
the
details
of
aristotle's
life
are
not
well-established
the
biographies
written
in
ancient
times
are
often
speculative
and
historians
only
agree
on
a
few
salient
points
aristotle
whose
name
means
the
best
purpose
in
ancient
greek
was
born
in
bc
in
stagira
chalcidice
about
km
miles
east
of
modern-day
thessaloniki
his
father
nicomachus
was
the
personal
physician
to
king
amyntas
of
macedon
both
of
aristotle's
parents
died
when
he
was
about
thirteen
and
proxenus
of
atarneus
became
his
guardian
although
little
information
about
aristotle's
childhood
has
survived
he
probably
spent
some
time
within
the
macedonian
palace
making
his
first
connections
with
the
macedonian
monarchy
at
the
age
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
aristotle
moved
to
athens
to
continue
his
education
at
plato's
academy
he
remained
there
for
nearly
twenty
years
before
leaving
athens
in
/
bc
the
traditional
story
about
his
departure
records
that
he
was
disappointed
with
the
academy's
direction
after
control
passed
to
plato's
nephew
speusippus
although
it
is
possible
that
he
feared
the
anti-macedonian
sentiments
in
athens
at
that
time
and
left
before
plato
died
aristotle
then
accompanied
xenocrates
to
the
court
of
his
friend
hermias
of
atarneus
in
asia
minor
after
the
death
of
hermias
aristotle
travelled
with
his
pupil
theophrastus
to
the
island
of
lesbos
where
together
they
researched
the
botany
and
zoology
of
the
island
and
its
sheltered
lagoon
while
in
lesbos
aristotle
married
pythias
either
hermias's
adoptive
daughter
or
niece
she
bore
him
a
daughter
whom
they
also
named
pythias
in
bc
aristotle
was
invited
by
philip
ii
of
macedon
to
become
the
tutor
to
his
son
alexander
aristotle
was
appointed
as
the
head
of
the
royal
academy
of
macedon
during
aristotle's
time
in
the
macedonian
court
he
gave
lessons
not
only
to
alexander
but
also
to
two
other
future
kings:
ptolemy
and
cassander
aristotle
encouraged
alexander
toward
eastern
conquest
and
aristotle's
own
attitude
towards
persia
was
unabashedly
ethnocentric
in
one
famous
example
he
counsels
alexander
to
be
a
leader
to
the
greeks
and
a
despot
to
the
barbarians
to
look
after
the
former
as
after
friends
and
relatives
and
to
deal
with
the
latter
as
with
beasts
or
plants
by
bc
aristotle
had
returned
to
athens
establishing
his
own
school
there
known
as
the
lyceum
aristotle
conducted
courses
at
the
school
for
the
next
twelve
years
while
in
athens
his
wife
pythias
died
and
aristotle
became
involved
with
herpyllis
of
stagira
who
bore
him
a
son
whom
he
named
after
his
father
nicomachus
according
to
the
suda
he
also
had
an
erômenos
palaephatus
of
abydus
this
period
in
athens
between
and
bc
is
when
aristotle
is
believed
to
have
composed
many
of
his
works
he
wrote
many
dialogues
of
which
only
fragments
have
survived
those
works
that
have
survived
are
in
treatise
form
and
were
not
for
the
most
part
intended
for
widespread
publication
they
are
generally
thought
to
be
lecture
aids
for
his
students
his
most
important
treatises
include
physics
metaphysics
nicomachean
ethics
politics
on
the
soul
and
poetics
aristotle
studied
and
made
significant
contributions
to
logic
metaphysics
mathematics
physics
biology
botany
ethics
politics
agriculture
medicine
dance
and
theatre
near
the
end
of
his
life
alexander
and
aristotle
became
estranged
over
alexander's
relationship
with
persia
and
persians
a
widespread
tradition
in
antiquity
suspected
aristotle
of
playing
a
role
in
alexander's
death
but
the
only
evidence
of
this
is
an
unlikely
claim
made
some
six
years
after
the
death
following
alexander's
death
anti-macedonian
sentiment
in
athens
was
rekindled
in
bc
demophilus
and
eurymedon
the
hierophant
reportedly
denounced
aristotle
for
impiety
prompting
him
to
flee
to
his
mother's
family
estate
in
chalcis
on
euboea
at
which
occasion
he
was
said
to
have
stated:
i
will
not
allow
the
athenians
to
sin
twice
against
philosophy
–
a
reference
to
athens's
trial
and
execution
of
socrates
he
died
on
euboea
of
natural
causes
later
that
same
year
having
named
his
student
antipater
as
his
chief
executor
and
leaving
a
will
in
which
he
asked
to
be
buried
next
to
his
wife
with
the
prior
analytics
aristotle
is
credited
with
the
earliest
study
of
formal
logic
and
his
conception
of
it
was
the
dominant
form
of
western
logic
until
th-century
advances
in
mathematical
logic
kant
stated
in
the
critique
of
pure
reason
that
with
aristotle
logic
reached
its
completion
what
we
today
call
aristotelian
logic
with
its
types
of
syllogism
methods
of
logical
argument
aristotle
himself
would
have
labelled
analytics
the
term
logic
he
reserved
to
mean
dialectics
most
of
aristotle's
work
is
probably
not
in
its
original
form
because
it
was
most
likely
edited
by
students
and
later
lecturers
the
logical
works
of
aristotle
were
compiled
into
a
set
of
six
books
called
the
organon
around
bc
by
andronicus
of
rhodes
or
others
among
his
followers
the
books
are:
categories
on
interpretation
prior
analytics
posterior
analytics
topics
on
sophistical
refutationsthe
order
of
the
books
or
the
teachings
from
which
they
are
composed
is
not
certain
but
this
list
was
derived
from
analysis
of
aristotle's
writings
it
goes
from
the
basics
the
analysis
of
simple
terms
in
the
categories
the
analysis
of
propositions
and
their
elementary
relations
in
on
interpretation
to
the
study
of
more
complex
forms
namely
syllogisms
in
the
analytics
and
dialectics
in
the
topics
and
sophistical
refutations
the
first
three
treatises
form
the
core
of
the
logical
theory
stricto
sensu:
the
grammar
of
the
language
of
logic
and
the
correct
rules
of
reasoning
the
rhetoric
is
not
conventionally
included
but
it
states
that
it
relies
on
the
topics
like
his
teacher
plato
aristotle's
philosophy
aims
at
the
universal
aristotle's
ontology
places
the
universal
katholou
in
particulars
kath'
hekaston
things
in
the
world
whereas
for
plato
the
universal
is
a
separately
existing
form
which
actual
things
imitate
this
means
that
aristotle's
epistemology
is
based
on
the
study
of
things
that
exist
or
happen
in
the
world
and
rises
to
knowledge
of
the
universal
whereas
for
plato
epistemology
begins
with
knowledge
of
universal
forms
or
ideas
and
descends
to
knowledge
of
particular
imitations
of
these
for
aristotle
form
is
still
what
phenomena
are
based
on
but
is
instantiated
in
a
particular
substance
aristotle
uses
induction
from
examples
alongside
deduction
whereas
plato
relies
on
deduction
from
a
priori
principles
in
aristotle's
terminology
natural
philosophy
is
a
branch
of
philosophy
examining
the
phenomena
of
the
natural
world
and
includes
fields
that
would
be
regarded
today
as
physics
biology
and
other
natural
sciences
aristotle's
work
encompassed
virtually
all
facets
of
intellectual
inquiry
aristotle
makes
philosophy
in
the
broad
sense
coextensive
with
reasoning
which
he
also
would
describe
as
science
note
however
that
his
use
of
the
term
science
carries
a
different
meaning
than
that
covered
by
the
term
scientific
method
for
aristotle

statistics
as
a
branch
of
mathematics
dealing

as
numerical

in
any
department
of

placed
in

other
statistics
is
a
mathematical

of
science
that
pertains
to
the
collection

interpretation
or
explanation
and
presentation
of

or
as
a
branch

some
consider
statistics
to
be
a
distinct
mathematical
science
rather
than
a
branch
of
mathematics
while
many
scientific
investigations
make
use
of
data
statistics
is
concerned
with
the
use
of
data
in
the
context
of
uncertainty
and
decision
making
in
the
face
of
uncertainty
mathematical
statistics
is
the
application
of
mathematics
to
statistics
mathematical
techniques
used
for
this
include
mathematical
analysis
linear
algebra
stochastic
analysis
differential
equations
and
measure-theoretic
probability
theory
in
applying
statistics
to
a
problem
it
is
common
practice
to
start
with
a
population
or
process
to
be
studied
populations
can
be
diverse
topics
such
as
all
persons
living
in
a
country
or
every
atom
composing
a
crystal
ideally
statisticians
compile
data
about
the
entire
population
an
operation
called
census
this
may
be
organized
by
governmental
statistical
institutes
descriptive
statistics
can
be
used
to
summarize
the
population
data
numerical
descriptors
include
mean
and
standard
deviation
for
continuous
data
types
like
income
while
frequency
and
percentage
are
more
useful
in
terms
of
describing
categorical
data
like
race
when
a
census
is
not
feasible
a
chosen
subset
of
the
population
called
a
sample
is
studied
once
a
sample
that
is
representative
of
the
population
is
determined
data
is
collected
for
the
sample
members
in
an
observational
or
experimental
setting
again
descriptive
statistics
can
be
used
to
summarize
the
sample
data
however
the
drawing
of
the
sample
has
been
subject
to
an
element
of
randomness
hence
the
established
numerical
descriptors
from
the
sample
are
also
due
to
uncertainty
to
still
draw
meaningful
conclusions
about
the
entire
population
inferential
statistics
is
needed
it
uses
patterns
in
the
sample
data
to
draw
inferences
about
the
population
represented
accounting
for
randomness
these
inferences
may
take
the
form
of:
answering
yes/no
questions
about
the
data
hypothesis
testing
estimating
numerical
characteristics
of
the
data
estimation
describing
associations
within
the
data
correlation
and
modeling
relationships
within
the
data
for
example
using
regression
analysis
inference
can
extend
to
forecasting
prediction
and
estimation
of
unobserved
values
either
in
or
associated
with
the
population
being
studied
it
can
include
extrapolation
and
interpolation
of
time
series
or
spatial
data
and
can
also
include
data
mining
when
full
census
data
cannot
be
collected
statisticians
collect
sample
data
by
developing
specific
experiment
designs
and
survey
samples
statistics
itself
also
provides
tools
for
prediction
and
forecasting
through
statistical
models
the
idea
of
making
inferences
based
on
sampled
data
began
around
the
mid-s
in
connection
with
estimating
populations
and
developing
precursors
of
life
insurance
to
use
a
sample
as
a
guide
to
an
entire
population
it
is
important
that
it
truly
represents
the
overall
population
representative
sampling
assures
that
inferences
and
conclusions
can
safely
extend
from
the
sample
to
the
population
as
a
whole
a
major
problem
lies
in
determining
the
extent
that
the
sample
chosen
is
actually
representative
statistics
offers
methods
to
estimate
and
correct
for
any
bias
within
the
sample
and
data
collection
procedures
there
are
also
methods
of
experimental
design
for
experiments
that
can
lessen
these
issues
at
the
outset
of
a
study
strengthening
its
capability
to
discern
truths
about
the
population
sampling
theory
is
part
of
the
mathematical
discipline
of
probability
theory
probability
is
used
in
mathematical
statistics
to
study
the
sampling
distributions
of
sample
statistics
and
more
generally
the
properties
of
statistical
procedures
the
use
of
any
statistical
method
is
valid
when
the
system
or
population
under
consideration
satisfies
the
assumptions
of
the
method
the
difference
in
point
of
view
between
classic
probability
theory
and
sampling
theory
is
roughly
that
probability
theory
starts
from
the
given
parameters
of
a
total
population
to
deduce
probabilities
that
pertain
to
samples
statistical
inference
however
moves
in
the
opposite
direction—inductively
inferring
from
samples
to
the
parameters
of
a
larger
or
total
population
a
common
goal
for
a
statistical
research
project
is
to
investigate
causality
and
in
particular
to
draw
a
conclusion
on
the
effect
of
changes
in
the
values
of
predictors
or
independent
variables
on
dependent
variables
there
are
two
major
types
of
causal
statistical
studies:
experimental
studies
and
observational
studies
in
both
types
of
studies
the
effect
of
differences
of
an
independent
variable
or
variables
on
the
behavior
of
the
dependent
variable
are
observed
the
difference
between
the
two
types
lies
in
how
the
study
is
actually
conducted
each
can
be
very
effective
an
experimental
study
involves
taking
measurements
of
the
system
under
study
manipulating
the
system
and
then
taking
additional
measurements
using
the
same
procedure
to
determine
if
the
manipulation
has
modified
the
values
of
the
measurements
in
contrast
an
observational
study
does
not
involve
experimental
manipulation
instead
data
are
gathered
and
correlations
between
predictors
and
response
are
investigated
while
the
tools
of
data
analysis
work
best
on
data
from
randomized
studies
they
are
also
applied
to
other
kinds
of
data—like
natural
experiments
and
observational
studies—for
which
a
statistician
would
use
a
modified
more
structured
estimation
method
e
g
difference
in
differences
estimation
and
instrumental
variables
among
many
others
that
produce
consistent
estimators
the
basic
steps
of
a
statistical
experiment
are:
planning
the
research
including
finding
the
number
of
replicates
of
the
study
using
the
following
information:
preliminary
estimates
regarding
the
size
of
treatment
effects
alternative
hypotheses
and
the
estimated
experimental
variability
consideration
of
the
selection
of
experimental
subjects
and
the
ethics
of
research
is
necessary
statisticians
recommend
that
experiments
compare
at
least
one
new
treatment
with
a
standard
treatment
or
control
to
allow
an
unbiased
estimate
of
the
difference
in
treatment
effects
design
of
experiments
using
blocking
to
reduce
the
influence
of
confounding
variables
and
randomized
assignment
of
treatments
to
subjects
to
allow
unbiased
estimates
of
treatment
effects
and
experimental
error
at
this
stage
the
experimenters
and
statisticians
write
the
experimental
protocol
that
will
guide
the
performance
of
the
experiment
and
which
specifies
the
primary
analysis
of
the
experimental
data
performing
the
experiment
following
the
experimental
protocol
and
analyzing
the
data
following
the
experimental
protocol
further
examining
the
data
set
in
secondary
analyses
to
suggest
new
hypotheses
for
future
study
documenting
and
presenting
the
results
of
the
study
experiments
on
human
behavior
have
special
concerns
the
famous
hawthorne
study
examined
changes
to
the
working
environment
at
the
hawthorne
plant
of
the
western
electric
company
the
researchers
were
interested
in
determining
whether
increased
illumination
would
increase
the
productivity
of
the
assembly
line
workers
the
researchers
first
measured
the
productivity
in
the
plant
then
modified
the
illumination
in
an
area
of
the
plant
and
checked
if
the
changes
in
illumination
affected
productivity
it
turned
out
that
productivity
indeed
improved
under
the
experimental
conditions
however
the
study
is
heavily
criticized
today
for
errors
in
experimental
procedures
specifically
for
the
lack
of
a
control
group
and
blindness
the
hawthorne
effect
refers
to
finding
that
an
outcome
in
this
case
worker
productivity
changed
due
to
observation
itself
those
in
the
hawthorne
study
became
more
productive
not
because
the
lighting
was
changed
but
because
they
were
being
observed
an
example
of
an
observational
study
is
one
that
explores
the
association
between
smoking
and
lung
cancer
this
type
of
study
typically
uses
a
survey
to
collect
observations
about
the
area
of
interest
and
then
performs
statistical
analysis
in
this
case
the
researchers
would
collect
observations
of
both
smokers
and
non-smokers
perhaps
through
a
cohort
study
and
then
look
for
the
number
of
cases
of
lung
cancer
in
each
group
a
case-control
study
is
another
type
of
observational
study
in
which
people
with
and
without
the
outcome
of
interest
e
g
lung
cancer
are
invited
to
participate
and
their
exposure
histories
are
collected
various
attempts
have
been
made
to
produce
a
taxonomy
of
levels
of
measurement
the
psychophysicist
stanley
smith
stevens
defined
nominal
ordinal
interval
and
ratio
scales
nominal
measurements
do
not
have
meaningful
rank
order
among
values
and
permit
any
one-to-one
transformation
ordinal
measurements
have
imprecise
differences
between
consecutive
values
but
have
a
meaningful
order
to
those
values
and
permit
any
order-preserving
transformation
interval
measurements
have
meaningful
distances
between
measurements
defined
but
the
zero
value
is
arbitrary
as
in
the
case
with
longitude
and
temperature
measurements
in
celsius
or
fahrenheit
and
permit
any
linear
transformation
ratio
measurements
have
both
a
meaningful
zero
value
and
the
distances
between
different
measurements
defined
and
permit
any
rescaling
transformation
because
variables
conforming
only
to
nominal
or
ordinal
measurements
cannot
be
reasonably
measured
numerically
sometimes
they
are
grouped
together
as
categorical
variables
whereas
ratio
and
interval
measurements
are
grouped
together
as
quantitative
variables
which
can
be
either

the
word
chemistry
comes
from
alchemy
which
referred
to
an
earlier
set
of
practices
that
encompassed
elements
of
chemistry
metallurgy
philosophy
astrology
astronomy
mysticism
and
medicine
it
is
often
seen
as
linked
to
the
quest
to
turn
lead
or
another
common
starting
material
into
gold
though
in
ancient
times
the
study
encompassed
many
of
the
questions
of
modern
chemistry
being
defined
as
the
study
of
the
composition
of
waters
movement
growth
embodying
disembodying
drawing
the
spirits
from
bodies
and
bonding
the
spirits
within
bodies
by
the
early
th
century
greek-egyptian
alchemist
zosimos
an
alchemist
was
called
a
'chemist'
in
popular
speech
and
later
the
suffix
-ry
was
added
to
this
to
describe
the
art
of
the
chemist
as
chemistry
the
modern
word
alchemy
in
turn
is
derived
from
the
arabic
word
al-kīmīā
الكیمیاء
in
origin
the
term
is
borrowed
from
the
greek
χημία
or
χημεία
this
may
have
egyptian
origins
since
al-kīmīā
is
derived
from
the
greek
χημία
which
is
in
turn
derived
from
the
word
kemet
which
is
the
ancient
name
of
egypt
in
the
egyptian
language
alternately
al-kīmīā
may
derive
from
χημεία
meaning
cast
together
the
current
model
of
atomic
structure
is
the
quantum
mechanical
model
traditional
chemistry
starts
with
the
study
of
elementary
particles
atoms
molecules
substances
metals
crystals
and
other
aggregates
of
matter
this
matter
can
be
studied
in
solid
liquid
or
gas
states
in
isolation
or
in
combination
the
interactions
reactions
and
transformations
that
are
studied
in
chemistry
are
usually
the
result
of
interactions
between
atoms
leading
to
rearrangements
of
the
chemical
bonds
which
hold
atoms
together
such
behaviors
are
studied
in
a
chemistry
laboratory
the
chemistry
laboratory
stereotypically
uses
various
forms
of
laboratory
glassware
however
glassware
is
not
central
to
chemistry
and
a
great
deal
of
experimental
as
well
as
applied/industrial
chemistry
is
done
without
it
a
chemical
reaction
is
a
transformation
of
some
substances
into
one
or
more
different
substances
the
basis
of
such
a
chemical
transformation
is
the
rearrangement
of
electrons
in
the
chemical
bonds
between
atoms
it
can
be
symbolically
depicted
through
a
chemical
equation
which
usually
involves
atoms
as
subjects
the
number
of
atoms
on
the
left
and
the
right
in
the
equation
for
a
chemical
transformation
is
equal
when
the
number
of
atoms
on
either
side
is
unequal
the
transformation
is
referred
to
as
a
nuclear
reaction
or
radioactive
decay
the
type
of
chemical
reactions
a
substance
may
undergo
and
the
energy
changes
that
may
accompany
it
are
constrained
by
certain
basic
rules
known
as
chemical
laws
energy
and
entropy
considerations
are
invariably
important
in
almost
all
chemical
studies
chemical
substances
are
classified
in
terms
of
their
structure
phase
as
well
as
their
chemical
compositions
they
can
be
analyzed
using
the
tools
of
chemical
analysis
e
g
spectroscopy
and
chromatography
scientists
engaged
in
chemical
research
are
known
as
chemists
most
chemists
specialize
in
one
or
more
sub-disciplines
several
concepts
are
essential
for
the
study
of
chemistry
some
of
them
are:
in
chemistry
matter
is
defined
as
anything
that
has
rest
mass
and
volume
it
takes
up
space
and
is
made
up
of
particles
the
particles
that
make
up
matter
have
rest
mass
as
well
–
not
all
particles
have
rest
mass
such
as
the
photon
matter
can
be
a
pure
chemical
substance
or
a
mixture
of
substances
the
atom
is
the
basic
unit
of
chemistry
it
consists
of
a
dense
core
called
the
atomic
nucleus
surrounded
by
a
space
occupied
by
an
electron
cloud
the
nucleus
is
made
up
of
positively
charged
protons
and
uncharged
neutrons
together
called
nucleons
while
the
electron
cloud
consists
of
negatively
charged
electrons
which
orbit
the
nucleus
in
a
neutral
atom
the
negatively
charged
electrons
balance
out
the
positive
charge
of
the
protons
the
nucleus
is
dense
the
mass
of
a
nucleon
is
appromixately
times
that
of
an
electron
yet
the
radius
of
an
atom
is
about
times
that
of
its
nucleus
the
atom
is
also
the
smallest
entity
that
can
be
envisaged
to
retain
the
chemical
properties
of
the
element
such
as
electronegativity
ionization
potential
preferred
oxidation
states
coordination

a
chemical
element
is
a
pure
substance
which
is
composed
of
a
single
type
of
atom
characterized
by
its
particular
number
of
protons
in
the
nuclei
of
its
atoms
known
as
the
atomic
number
and
represented
by
the
symbol
z
the
mass
number
is
the
sum
of
the
number
of
protons
and
neutrons
in
a
nucleus
although
all
the
nuclei
of
all
atoms
belonging
to
one
element
will
have
the
same
atomic
number
they
may
not
necessarily
have
the
same
mass
number
atoms
of
an
element
which
have
different
mass
numbers
are
known
as
isotopes
for
example
all
atoms
with
protons
in
their
nuclei
are
atoms
of
the
chemical
element
carbon
but
atoms
of
carbon
may
have
mass
numbers
of
or
the
standard
presentation
of
the
chemical
elements
is
in
the
periodic
table
which
orders
elements
by
atomic
number
the
periodic
table
is
arranged
in
groups
or
columns
and
periods
or
rows
the
periodic
table
is
useful
in
identifying
periodic
trends
a
compound
is
a
pure
chemical
substance
composed
of
more
than
one
element
the
properties
of
a
compound
bear
little
similarity
to
those
of
its
elements
the
standard
nomenclature
of
compounds
is
set
by
the
international
union
of
pure

iupac
organic
compounds
are
named
according

system
the
names
for
inorganic
compounds
are
created
according
to
the
inorganic

system
when
a
compound
has
more
than
one
component
then
they
are
divided
into
two
classes
the
electropositive
and
the
electronegative
components
in
addition
the
chemical
abstracts
service
has
devised
a
method
to
index
chemical
substances
in
this
scheme
each
chemical
substance
is
identifiable
by
a
number
known
as

is
the

begins
the

with
pieces
of
the
specified
color
which
consist
of
one
king
one
queen
two
rooks
two
bishops
two
knights
and
eight
pawns
the
pieces
are
set
out
as
shown
in
the
diagram
and
photo
with
each
queen
on
a
square
of
its
own
color
the
white
queen
on
a
light
square
and
the
black
queen
on
a
dark
the
player
with
the
white
pieces
always
moves
first
after
the
first
move
players
alternately
move
one
piece
per
turn
except
for
castling
when
two
pieces
are
moved
pieces
are
moved
to
either
an
unoccupied
square
or
one
occupied
by
an
opponent's
piece
which
is
captured
and
removed
from
play
with
the
sole
exception
of
en
passant
all
pieces
capture
by
moving
to
the
square
that
the
opponent's
piece
occupies
a
player
may
not
make
any
move
that
would
put
or
leave
the
player's
own
king
under
attack
a
player
cannot
pass
at
each
turn
one
must
make
a
legal
move
this
is
the
basis
for
the
finesse
called
zugzwang
if
the
player
to
move
has
no
legal
move
the
game
is
over
it
is
either
a
checkmate
a
loss
for
the
player
with
no
legal
moves
if
the
king
is
under
attack
or
a
stalemate
a
draw
if
the
king
is
not
each
chess
piece
has
its
own
way
of
moving
in
the
diagrams
the
dots
mark
the
squares
where
the
piece
can
move
if
there
are
no
intervening
pieces
of
either
color
the
king
moves
one
square
in
any
direction
the
king
also
has
a
special
move
called
castling
that
involves
also
moving
a
rook
the
rook
can
move
any
number
of
squares
along
a
rank
or
file
but
cannot
leap
over
other
pieces
along
with
the
king
a
rook
is
involved
during
the
king's
castling
move
the
bishop
can
move
any
number
of
squares
diagonally
but
cannot
leap
over
other
pieces
the
queen
combines
the
power
of
a
rook
and
bishop
and
can
move
any
number
of
squares
along
a
rank
file
or
diagonal
but
cannot
leap
over
other
pieces
the
knight
moves
to
any
of
the
closest
squares
that
are
not
on
the
same
rank
file
or
diagonal
thus
the
move
forms
an
l-shape:
two
squares
vertically
and
one
square
horizontally
or
two
squares
horizontally
and
one
square
vertically
the
knight
is
the
only
piece
that
can
leap
over
other
pieces
the
pawn
can
move
forward
to
the
unoccupied
square
immediately
in
front
of
it
on
the
same
file
or
on
its
first
move
it
can
advance
two
squares
along
the
same
file
provided
both
squares
are
unoccupied
black
dots
in
the
diagram
or
the
pawn
can
capture
an
opponent's
piece
on
a
square
diagonally
in
front
of
it
on
an
adjacent
file
by
moving
to
that
square
black
xs
a
pawn
has
two
special
moves:
the
en
passant
capture
and
promotion
once
in
every
game
each
king
is
allowed
to
make
a
special
move
known
as
castling
castling
consists
of
moving
the
king
two
squares
along
the
first
rank
toward
a
rook
which
is
on
the
player's
first
rank
and
then
placing
the
rook
on
the
last
square
that
the
king
has
just
crossed
castling
is
permissible
under
the
following
conditions:
neither
the
king
nor
the
rook
have
previously
moved
during
the
game
there
cannot
be
any
pieces
between
the
king
and
the
rook
the
king
cannot
be
in
check
nor
can
the
king
pass
through
squares
that
are
under
attack
by
enemy
pieces
or
move
to
a
square
where
it
would
result
in
a
check
note
that
castling
is
permissible
if
the
rook
is
attacked
or
if
the
rook
crosses
a
square
that
is
attacked
when
a
pawn
advances
two
squares
from
its
starting
position
and
there
is
an
opponent's
pawn
on
an
adjacent
file
next
to
its
destination
square
then
the
opponent's
pawn
can
capture
it
en
passant
in
passing
and
move
to
the
square
the
pawn
passed
over
this
can
only
be
done
on
the
very
next
move
otherwise
the
right
to
do
so
is
forfeit
for
example
in
the
animated
diagram
the
black
pawn
advances
two
squares
from
g
to
g
and
the
white
pawn
on
f
can
take
it
via
en
passant
on
g
but
only
on
white's
next
move
when
a
pawn
advances
to
the
eighth
rank
as
a
part
of
the
move
it
is
promoted
and
must
be
exchanged
for
the
player's
choice
of
queen
rook
bishop
or
knight
of
the
same
color
usually
the
pawn
is
chosen
to
be
promoted
to
a
queen
but
in
some
cases
another
piece
is
chosen
this
is
called
underpromotion
in
the
animated
diagram
the
pawn
on
c
can
be
advanced
to
the
eighth
rank
and
be
promoted
to
an
allowed
piece
there
is
no
restriction
placed
on
the
piece
that
is
chosen
on
promotion
so
it
is
possible
to
have
more
pieces
of
the
same
type
than
at
the
start
of
the
game
for
example
two
queens
when
a
king
is
under
immediate
attack
by
one
or
two
of
the
opponent's
pieces
it
is
said
to
be
in
check
a
response
to
a
check
is
a
legal
move
if
it
results
in
a
position
where
the
king
is
no
longer
under
direct
attack
that
is
not
in
check
this
can
involve
capturing
the
checking
piece
interposing
a
piece
between
the
checking
piece
and
the
king
which
is
possible
only
if
the
attacking
piece
is
a
queen
rook
or
bishop
and
there
is
a
square
between
it
and
the
king
or
moving
the
king
to
a
square
where
it
is
not
under
attack
castling
is
not
a
permissible
response
to
a
check
the
object
of
the
game
is
to
checkmate
the
opponent
this
occurs
when
the
opponent's
king
is
in
check
and
there
is
no
legal
way
to
remove
it
from
attack
it
is
illegal
for
a
player
to
make
a
move
that
would
put
or
leave
the
player's
own
king
in
check
in
casual
games
it
is
common
to
announce
check
when
putting
the
opponent's
king
in
check
but
this
is
not
required
by
the
rules
of
the
game
and
is
not
usually
done
in
tournaments
games
can
be
won
in
the
following
ways:
checkmate:
the
player
whose
turn
it
is
to
move
is
in
check
and
has
no
legal
move
to
escape
check
resignation:
either
player
may
resign
conceding
the
game
to
the
opponent
it
is
usually
considered
poor
etiquette
to
play
on
in
a
truly
hopeless
position
and
for
this
reason
high-level
games
rarely
end
in
checkmate
win
on
time:
in
games
with
a
time
control
a
player
wins
if
the
opponent
runs
out
of
time
even
if
the
opponent
has
a
much
superior
position
as
long
as
the
player
still
has
a
theoretical
possibility
to
checkmate
the
opponent
forfeit:
a
player
who
cheats
or
violates
the
rules
of
the
game
or
violates
the
rules
specified
for
the
particular
tournament
can
be
forfeited
in
high-level
tournaments
players
have
been
forfeited
for
such
things
as
arriving
late
for
the
game
even
by
a
matter
of
seconds
receiving
a
call
or
text
on
a
cell
phone
refusing
to
undergo
a
drug
test
refusing
to
undergo
a
body
search
for
electronic
devices
and
unsporting
behavior
such
as
refusing
to
shake
the
opponent's
hand
there
are
several
ways
games
can
end
in
a
draw:
draw
by
agreement:
draws
are
most
commonly
reached
by
mutual
agreement
between
the
players
the
correct
procedure
is
to
verbally
offer
the
draw
make
a
move
then
start
the
opponent's
clock
traditionally
players
have
been
allowed
to
agree
to
a
draw
at
any
point
in
the
game
occasionally
even
without
playing
a
move
in
recent
years
efforts
have
been
made
to
discourage
short
draws
for
example
by
forbidding
draw
offers
before
move
thirty
stalemate:
the
player
whose
turn
it
is
to
move
has
no
legal
move
and
is
not
in
check
threefold
repetition
of
position:
this
most
commonly
occurs
when
neither
side
is
able
to
avoid
repeating
moves
without
incurring
a
disadvantage
in
this
situation
either
player
can
claim
a
draw
this
requires
the
players
to
keep
a
valid
written
record
of
the
game
so
that
the
claim
can
be
verified
by
the
arbiter
if
challenged
the
three
occurrences
of
the
position
need
not
occur
on
consecutive
moves
for
a
claim
to
be
valid
fide
rules
make
no
mention
of
perpetual
check
this
is
merely
a
specific
type
of
draw
by
threefold
repetition
fifty-move
rule:
if
during
the
previous
moves
no
pawn
has
been
moved
and
no
capture
has
been
made
either
player
can
claim
a
draw
there
are
several
known
endgames
where
it
is
possible
to
force
a
mate
but
it
requires
more
than
moves
before
a
pawn
move
or
capture
is
made
examples
include
some
endgames
with
two
knights
against
a
pawn
and
some
pawnless
endgames
such
as
queen
against
two
bishops
historically
fide
has
sometimes
revised
the
-move
rule
to
make
exceptions
for
these
endgames
but
these
have
since
been
repealed
some
correspondence
chess
organizations
do
not
enforce
the
fifty-move
rule
fivefold
repetition
of
position:
similar
to
the
threefold-repetition
rule
but
in
this
case
neither
player
needs
to
claim
the
draw
thus
a
tournament
director
can
intervene
and
declare
the
game
to
be
drawn
this
is
a
relatively
recent
addition
to
the
fide
rules
seventy-five-move
rule:
similar
to
the
fifty-move
rule
however
if
the
final
move
in
the
sequence
resulted
in
checkmate
this
takes
precedence
as
with
the
fivefold-repetition
rule
this
applies
independently
of
claims
by
the
players
and
allows
a
tournament
director
to
intervene
this
rule
likewise
is
a
recent
addition
to
the
fide
rules
insufficient
material:
if
neither
player
has
a
theoretical
possibility
to
checkmate
the
opponent
for
example
if
a
player
has
only
the
king
and
a
knight
left
and
the
opponent
has
only
the
king
left
checkmate
is
impossible
and
the
game
is
drawn
by
this
rule
on
the
other
hand
if
both
players
have
a
king
and
a
knight
left
there
is
a
highly
unlikely
yet
theoretical
possibility
of
checkmate
so
this
rule
does
not
apply
draw
on
time:
in
games
with
a
time
control
the
game
is
drawn
if
a
player
is
out
of
time
and
the
opponent
has
no
theoretical
possibility
to
checkmate
the
player
chess
games
may
also
be
played
with
a
time
control
if
a
player's
time
runs
out
before
the
game
is
completed
the
game
is
automatically
lost
provided
the
opponent
has
enough
pieces
left
to
deliver
checkmate
the
duration
of
a
game
ranges
from
long
or
classical
games
which
can
take
up
to
seven
hours
even
longer
if
adjournments
are
permitted
to
bullet
chess
under
minutes
per
player
for
the
entire
game
intermediate
between
these
are
rapid
chess
games
lasting
between
minutes
and
two
hours
per
game
a
popular
time
control
in
amateur
weekend
tournaments
time
is
controlled
using
a
chess
clock
that
has
two
displays
one
for
each
player's
remaining
time
analog
chess
clocks
have
been
largely
replaced
by
digital
clocks
which
allow
for
time
controls
with
increments
chess
is
believed
to
have
originated
in
eastern
india
c
–
in
the
gupta
empire
where
its
early
form
in
the
th
century
was
known
as
chaturaṅga
sanskrit:
चतुरङ्ग
literally
four
divisions
[of
the
military]
–
infantry
cavalry
elephants
and
chariotry
represented
by
the
pieces
that
would
evolve
into
the
modern
pawn
knight
bishop
and
rook
respectively
thence
it
spread
eastward
and
westward
along
the
silk
road
the
earliest
evidence
of
chess
is
found
in
the
nearby
sassanid
persia
around
where
the
game
came
to
be
known
by
the
name
chatrang
chatrang
was
taken
up
by
the
muslim
world
after
the
islamic
conquest
of
persia
–
where
it
was
then
named
shatranj
with
the
pieces
largely
retaining
their
persian
names
in
spanish
shatranj
was
rendered
as
ajedrez
al-shatranj
in
portuguese
as
xadrez
and
in
greek
as
ζατρίκιον
zatrikion
which
comes
directly
from
the
persian
chatrang
but
in
the
rest
of
europe
it
was
replaced
by
versions
of
the
persian
shāh
king
which
was
familiar
as
an
exclamation
and
became
the
english
words
check
and
chess
the
oldest
archaeological

artifacts

pieces
were
excavated
in

some
of

the

manual
was

dates
to

the

migration
of
chess
into

has
even
less
documentation
than

comes
in
the

record
of
the
mysterious

strange
dating
to

alternatively
some
contend
that
chess
arose
from
chinese
chess
or
one
of
its
predecessors
although
this
has
been
contested
the
game
reached
western
europe
and
russia
by
at
least
three
routes
the
earliest

in
the
th
century
by
the
year
it
had
spread
throughout
europe
introduced
into
the
iberian
peninsula
by
the
muslims
in
the
th

it
was
described
in
a
famous
th-century
manuscript
covering
shatranj
backgammon
and
dice
named
the
libro
de
los
juegos
around
the
rules
of
shatranj
started
to
be
modified
in
southern
europe
and
around
several
major
changes
made
the
game
essentially
as
it
is
known
today
these
modern
rules
for
the
basic
moves
had
been
adopted
in
italy
and
spain
pawns
gained
the
option
of
advancing
two
squares
on
their
first
move
while
bishops
and
queens
acquired
their
modern
abilities
the
queen
replaced
the
earlier
vizier
chess
piece
towards
the
end
of
the
th
century
and
by
the
th
century
had
become
the
most
powerful
piece
consequently
modern
chess
was
referred
to
as
queen's
chess
or
mad
queen
chess
castling
derived
from
the
kings
leap
usually
in
combination
with
a
pawn
or
rook
move
to
bring
the
king
to
safety
was
introduced
these
new
rules
quickly
spread
throughout
western
europe
the
rules
concerning
stalemate
were
finalized
in
the
early
th
century
also
in
the
th
century
the
convention
that
white
moves
first
was
established
formerly
either
white
or
black
could
move
first
finally
the
rules
around
castling
were
standardized
–
variations
in
the
castling
rules
had
persisted
in
italy
until
the
late
th
century
the
resulting
standard
game
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
western
chess
or
international
chess
particularly
in
asia
where
other
games
of
the
chess
family
such
as
xiangqi
are
prevalent
since
the
th
century
the
only
rule
changes
have
been
technical
in
nature

as
the

organization
developed
quickly
many
chess
clubs
chess

appeared

were

bernhard

some
of

the
first

of

theory
chess
was
occasionally
criticised
in
the
th
century
as
a
waste
of
time
the
first
modern
chess
tournament
was
organized
by
howard
staunton
a
leading
english
chess
player
and
was
held
in
london
in
it
was
won
by
the
german
adolf
anderssen
who
was
hailed
as
the
leading
chess
master
his
brilliant
energetic
attacking
style
was
typical
for
the
time
sparkling
games
like
anderssen's
immortal
game
and
evergreen
game
or
morphy's
opera
game
were
regarded
as
the
highest
possible
summit
of
the
chess
art
deeper
insight
into
the
nature
of
chess
came
with
two
younger
players
american
paul
morphy
an
extraordinary
chess
prodigy
won
against
all
important
competitors
except
staunton
who
refused
to
play
including
anderssen
during
his
short
chess
career
between
and
morphy's
success
stemmed
from
a
combination
of
brilliant
attacks
and
sound
strategy
he
intuitively
knew
how
to
prepare
attacks
prague-born
wilhelm
steinitz
beginning
in
described
how
to
avoid
weaknesses
in
one's
own
position
and
how
to
create
and
exploit
such
weaknesses
in
the
opponent's
position
the
scientific
approach
and
positional
understanding
of
steinitz
revolutionized
the
game
steinitz
was
the
first
to
break
a
position
down
into
its
components
before
steinitz
players
brought
their
queen
out
early
did
not
completely
develop
their
other
pieces
and
mounted
a
quick
attack
on
the
opposing
king
which
either
succeeded
or
failed
the
level
of
defense
was
poor
and
players
did
not
form
any
deep
plan
in
addition
to
his
theoretical
achievements
steinitz
founded
an
important
tradition:
his
triumph
over
the
leading
german
master
johannes
zukertort
in
is
regarded
as
the
first
official
world
chess
championship
steinitz
lost
his
crown
in
to
a
much
younger
player
the
german
mathematician
emanuel
lasker
who
maintained
this
title
for
years
the
longest
tenure
of
all
world
champions
after
the
end
of
the
th
century
the
number
of
master
tournaments
and
matches
held
annually
quickly
grew
some
sources
state
that
in
the
title
of
chess
grandmaster
was
first
formally
conferred
by
tsar
nicholas
ii
of
russia
to
lasker
capablanca
alekhine
tarrasch
and
marshall
but
this
is
a
disputed
claim
the
tradition
of
awarding
such
titles
was
continued
by
the
world
chess
federation
fide
founded
in
in
paris
in
the
women's
world
chess
championship
was
established
the
first
to
hold
the
title
was
czech-english
master
vera
menchik
it
took
a
prodigy
from
cuba
josé
raúl
capablanca
world
champion
–
who
loved
simple
positions
and
endgames
to
end
the
german-speaking
dominance
in
chess
he
was
undefeated
in
tournament
play
for
eight
years
until
his
successor
was
russian-french
alexander
alekhine
a
strong
attacking
player
who
died
as
the
world
champion
in
he
briefly
lost
the
title
to
dutch
player
max
euwe
in
and
regained
it
two
years
later
between
the
world
wars
chess
was
revolutionized
by
the
new
theoretical
school
of
so-called
hypermodernists
like
aron
nimzowitsch
and
richard
réti
they
advocated
controlling
the
center
of
the
board
with
distant
pieces
rather
than
with
pawns
thus
inviting
opponents
to
occupy
the
center
with
pawns
which
become
objects
of
attack
after
the
death
of
alekhine
a
new
world
champion
was
sought
fide
which
has
controlled
the
title
since
then
except
for
one
interruption
ran
a
tournament
of
elite
players
the
winner
of
the
tournament
russian
mikhail
botvinnik
started
an
era
of
soviet
dominance
in
the
chess
world
until
the
end
of
the
soviet
union
there
was
only
one
non-soviet

botvinnik
revolutionized
opening
theory
previously
black

to
neutralize
white's
first-move
advantage
as
black
botvinnik
strove
for
the
initiative
from
the
beginning
in
the
previous
informal
system
of
world
championships
the
current
champion
decided
which
challenger
he
would
play
for
the
title
and
the
challenger
was
forced
to
seek
sponsors
for
the
match
fide
set
up
a
new
system
of
qualifying
tournaments
and
matches
the
world's
strongest
players
were
seeded
into
interzonal
tournaments
where
they
were
joined
by
players
who
had
qualified
from
zonal
tournaments
the
leading
finishers
in
these
interzonals
would
go
on
the
candidates
stage
which
was
initially
a
tournament
and
later
a
series
of
knockout
matches
the
winner
of
the
candidates
would
then
play
the
reigning
champion
for
the
title
a
champion
defeated
in
a
match
had
a
right
to
play
a
rematch
a
year
later
this
system
operated
on
a
three-year
cycle
botvinnik
participated
in
championship
matches
over
a
period
of
fifteen
years
he
won
the
world
championship
tournament
in
and
retained
the
title
in
tied
matches
in
and
in
he
lost
to
vasily
smyslov
but
regained
the
title
in
a

in
in
he
lost
the
title
to
the
-year-old
latvian
prodigy
mikhail

an
accomplished
tactician
and
attacking
player
botvinnik
again
regained
the
title
in
a
rematch
in
following
the
event
fide
abolished
the
automatic
right
of
a
deposed
champion
to
a

and
the
next
champion
armenian
tigran
petrosian
a
player
renowned
for
his
defensive
and
positional
skills
held
the
title
for
two
cycles
–
his
successor
boris
spassky
from
russia
champion
–
won
games
in
both
positional
and
sharp
tactical
style
the
next
championship
the
so-called
match
of
the
century
saw
the
first
non-soviet
challenger
since
world
war
ii
american
bobby
fischer
who
defeated
his
candidates
opponents
by
unheard-of
margins
and
clearly
won
the
world
championship
match
in
however
fischer
refused
to
defend
his
title
against
soviet
anatoly
karpov
when
fide
did
not
meet
his
demands
and
karpov
obtained
the
title
by
default
fischer
modernized
many
aspects
of
chess
especially
by
extensively
preparing
openings
karpov
defended
his
title
twice
against
viktor
korchnoi
and
dominated
the
and
early
with
a
string
of
tournament
successes
karpov's
reign
finally
ended
in
at
the
hands
of
garry
kasparov
another
soviet
player
from
baku
azerbaijan
kasparov
and

contested
five
world

never
won
his

back
in

and
nigel
short
broke
with

to
organize
their

match
for
the

and
formed
a

van

long
influence
on

is
reflected
in
the
title
given
to
him
by
the
python
community:
benevolent

python
was
released
on

it
was
a
major
revision
of

many
of

python
's
end-of-life

initially
set
at
then
postponed
to
out
of
concern
that
a
large
body
of
existing
code
could
not
easily
be
forward-ported
to
python
in
january
google
announced
work
on

python
uses
dynamic
typing
and
a
combination
of
the
word
comedy
is
derived
from
the
classical
greek
κωμῳδία
kōmōidía
which
is
a
compound
either
of
κῶμος
kômos
revel
or
κώμη
kṓmē
village
and
ᾠδή
ōidḗ
singing
it
is
possible
that
κῶμος
itself
is
derived
from
κώμη
and
originally
meant
a
village
revel
the
adjective
comic
greek
κωμικός
kōmikós
which
strictly
means
that
which
relates
to
comedy
is
in
modern
usage
generally
confined
to
the
sense
of
laughter-provoking
of
this
the
word
came
into
modern
usage
through
the
latin
comoedia
and
italian
commedia
and
has
over
time
passed
through
various
shades
of
meaning
the
greeks
and
romans
confined
their
use
of
the
word
comedy
to
descriptions
of
stage-plays
with
happy
endings
aristotle
defined
comedy
as
an
imitation
of
men
worse
than
the
average
where
tragedy
was
an
imitation
of
men
better
than
the
average
however
the
characters
portrayed
in
comedies
were
not
worse
than
average
in
every
way
only
insofar
as
they
are
ridiculous
which
is
a
species
of
the
ugly
the
ridiculous
may
be
defined
as
a
mistake
or
deformity
not
productive
of
pain
or
harm
to
others
the
mask
for
instance
that
excites
laughter
is
something
ugly
and
distorted
without
causing
pain
in
the
middle
ages
the
term
expanded
to
include
narrative
poems
with
happy
endings
it
is
in
this
sense
that
dante
used
the
term
in
the
title
of
his
poem
la
commedia
as
time
progressed
the
word
came
more
and
more
to
be
associated
with
any
sort
of
performance
intended
to
cause
laughter
during
the
middle
ages
the
term
comedy
became
synonymous
with
satire
and
later
with
humour
in
general
aristotle's
poetics
was
translated
into
arabic
in
the
medieval
islamic
world
where
it
was
elaborated
upon
by
arabic
writers
and
islamic
philosophers
such
as
abu
bischr
and
his
pupils
al-farabi
avicenna
and
averroes
they
disassociated
comedy
from
greek
dramatic
representation
and
instead
identified
it
with
arabic
poetic
themes
and
forms
such
as
hija
satirical
poetry
they
viewed
comedy
as
simply
the
art
of
reprehension
and
made
no
reference
to
light
and
cheerful
events
or
to
the
troubling
beginnings
and
happy
endings
associated
with
classical
greek
comedy
after
the
latin
translations
of
the
th
century
the
term
comedy
gained
a
more
general
meaning
in
medieval
literature
in
the
late
th
century
many
scholars
preferred
to
use
the
term
laughter
to
refer
to
the
whole
gamut
of
the
comic
in
order
to
avoid
the
use
of
ambiguous
and
problematically
defined
genres
such
as
the
grotesque
irony
and
satire
starting
from
bce
aristophanes
a
comic
playwright
and
satirical
author
of
the
ancient
greek
theater
wrote
comedies
of
which
survive
aristophanes
developed
his
type
of
comedy
from
the
earlier
satyr
plays
which
were
often
highly
obscene
the
only
surviving
examples
of
the
satyr
plays
are
by
euripides
which
are
much
later
examples
and
not
representative
of
the
genre
in
ancient
greece
comedy
originated
in
bawdy
and
ribald
songs
or
recitations
apropos
of
phallic
processions
and
fertility
festivals
or
gatherings
around
bce
aristotle
in
his
work
poetics
stated
that
comedy
originated
in
phallic
processions
and
the
light
treatment
of
the
otherwise
base
and
ugly
he
also
adds
that
the
origins
of
comedy
are
obscure
because
it
was
not
treated
seriously
from
its
inception
however
comedy
had
its
own
muse:
thalia
aristotle
taught
that
comedy
was
generally
positive
for
society
since
it
brings
forth
happiness
which
for
aristotle
was
the
ideal
state
the
final
goal
in
any
activity
for
aristotle
a
comedy
did
not
need
to
involve

the

mostly
because
of
the

iv
the
medieval
usage
alternates
with
order
in
designating

those
of
monastic
orders:
we

of

of
the
golden

of
a
knight
'of

of
avys'
in
the
ancient
and
medieval
world
the
etymological
latin
root
religio
was
understood
as
an
individual
virtue
of
worship
in
mundane
contexts
never
as
doctrine
practice
or
actual
source
of
knowledge
in
general
religio
referred
to
broad
social
obligations
towards
anything
including
family
neighbors
rulers
and
even
towards
god
religio
was
most
often
used
by
the
ancient
romans
not
in
the
context
of
a
relation
towards
gods
but
as
a
range
of
general
emotions
such
as
hesitation
caution
anxiety
fear
feelings
of
being
bound
restricted
inhibited
which
arose
from
heightened
attention
in
any
mundane
context
the
term
was
also
closely
related
to
other
terms
like
scrupulus
which
meant
very
precisely
and
some
roman
authors
related
the
term
supertitio
which
meant
too
much
fear
or
anxiety
or
shame
to
religio
at
times
when
religio
came
into
english
around
the
as
religion
it
took
the
meaning
of
life
bound
by
monastic
vows
or
monastic
orders
the
compartmentalized
concept
of
religion
where
religious
things
were
separated
from
worldly
things
was
not
used
before
the
the
concept
of
religion
was
first
used
in
the
to
distinguish
the
domain
of
the
church
and
the
domain
of
civil
authorities
in
the
ancient
greece
the
greek
term
threskeia
was
loosely
translated
into
latin
as
religio
in
late
antiquity
the
term
was
sparsely
used
in
classical
greece
but
became
more
frequently
used
in
the
writings
of
josephus
in
the
first
century
ce
it
was
used
in
mundane
contexts
and
could
mean
multiple
things
from
respectful
fear
to
excessive
or
harmfully
distracting
practices
of
others
to
cultic
practices
it
was
often
contrasted
with
the
greek
word
deisidaimonia
which
meant
too
much
fear
the
modern
concept
of
religion
as
an
abstraction
that
entails
distinct
sets
of
beliefs
or
doctrines
is
a
recent
invention
in
the
english
language
since
such
usage
began
with
texts
from
the
th
century
due
to
the
splitting
of
christendom
during
the
protestant
reformation
and
globalization
in
the
age
of
exploration
which
involved
contact
with
numerous
foreign
cultures
with
non-european
languages
some
argue
that
regardless
of
its
definition
it
is
not
appropriate
to
apply
the
term
religion
to
non-western
cultures
others
argue
that
using
religion
on
non-western
cultures
distorts
what
people
do
and
believe
the
concept
of
religion
was
formed
in
the
th
and
th
centuries
despite
the
fact
that
ancient
sacred
texts
like
the
bible
the
quran
and
others
did
not
have
a
word
or
even
a
concept
of
religion
in
the
original
languages
and
neither
did
the
people
or
the
cultures
in
which
these
sacred
texts
were
written
for
example
there
is
no
precise
equivalent
of
religion
in
hebrew
and
judaism
does
not
distinguish
clearly
between
religious
national
racial
or
ethnic
identities
one
of
its
central
concepts
is
halakha
meaning
the
walk
or
path
sometimes
translated
as
law
which
guides
religious
practice
and
belief
and
many
aspects
of
daily
life
even
though
the
beliefs
and
traditions
of
judaism
are
found
in
the
ancient
world
ancient
jews
saw
jewish
identity
as
being
about
an
ethnic
or
national
identity
and
did
not
entail
a
compulsory
belief
system
or
regulated
rituals
even
in
the
st
century
ce
josephus
had
used
the
greek
term
ioudaismos
which
some
translate
as
judaism
today
even
though
he
used
it
as
an
ethnic
term
not
one
linked
to
modern
abstract
concepts
of
religion
as
a
set
of
beliefs
it
was
in
the
th
century
that
jews
began
to
see
their
ancestral
culture
as
a
religion
analogous
to
christianity
the
greek
word
threskeia
which
was
used
by
greek
writers
such
as
herodotus
and
josephus
is
found
in
the
new
testament
threskeia
is
sometimes
translated
as
religion
in
today's
translations
however
the
term
was
understood
as
worship
well
into
the
medieval
period
in
the
quran
the
arabic
word
din
is
often
translated
as
religion
in
modern
translations
but
up
to
the
mid-s
translators
expressed
din
as
law
the
sanskrit
word
dharma
sometimes
translated
as
religion
also
means
law
throughout
classical
south
asia
the
study
of
law
consisted
of
concepts
such
as
penance
through
piety
and
ceremonial
as
well
as
practical
traditions
medieval
japan
at
first
had
a
similar
union
between
imperial
law
and
universal
or
buddha
law
but
these
later
became
independent
sources
of
power
throughout
the
americas
native
americans
never
had
a
concept
of
religion
and
any
suggestion
otherwise
is
a
colonial
imposition
by
christians
though
traditions
sacred
texts
and
practices
have
existed
throughout
time
most
cultures
did
not
align
with
western
conceptions
of
religion
since
they
did
not
separate
everyday
life
from
the
sacred
in
the
th
and
th
centuries
the
terms
buddhism
hinduism
taoism
confucianism
and
world

entered
the
english

no
one
self-identified
as
a

similar
terms

historically
been
used
as
a
geographical
cultural
and
later
religious
identifier
for
people
indigenous
to
the
indian
subcontinent
throughout
its
long
history
japan
had
no
concept
of
religion
since
there
was
no
corresponding
japanese
word
nor
anything
close
to
its
meaning
but
when
american
warships
appeared
off
the
coast
of
japan
in
and
forced
the
japanese
government
to
sign
treaties
demanding
among
other
things
freedom
of
religion
the
country
had
to
contend
with
this
western
idea
according
to
the
philologist
max
müller
in
the
th
century
the
root
of
the
english
word
religion
the
latin
religio
was
originally
used
to
mean
only
reverence
for
god
or
the
gods
careful
pondering
of
divine
things
piety
which
cicero
further
derived
to
mean
diligence
max
müller
characterized
many
other
cultures
around
the
world
including
egypt
persia
and
india
as
having
a
similar
power
structure
at
this
point
in
history
what
is
called
ancient
religion
today
they
would
have
only
called
law
scholars
have
failed
to
agree
on
a
definition
of
religion
there
are
however
two
general
definition
systems:
the
sociological/functional
and
the
phenomenological/philosophical
religion
is
a
modern
western
concept
parallel
concepts
are
not
found
in
many
current
and
past
cultures
there
is
no
equivalent
term
for
religion
in
many
languages
scholars
have
found
it
difficult
to
develop
a
consistent
definition
with
some
giving
up
on
the
possibility
of
a
definition
others
argue
that
regardless
of
its
definition
it
is
not
appropriate
to
apply
it
to
non-western
cultures
an
increasing
number
of
scholars
have
expressed
reservations
about
ever
defining
the
essence
of
religion
they
observe
that
the
way
we
use
the
concept
today
is
a
particularly
modern
construct
that
would
not
have
been
understood
through
much
of
history
and
in
many
cultures
outside
the
west
or
even
in
the
west
until
after
the
peace
of
westphalia
the
macmillan
encyclopedia
of
religions
states:
the
very
attempt
to
define
religion
to
find
some
distinctive
or
possibly
unique
essence
or
set
of
qualities
that
distinguish
the
religious
from
the
remainder
of
human
life
is
primarily
a
western
concern
the
attempt
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
western
speculative
intellectualistic
and
scientific
disposition
it
is
also
the
product
of
the
dominant
western
religious
mode
what
is
called
the
judeo-christian
climate
or
more
accurately
the
theistic
inheritance
from
judaism
christianity
and
islam
the
the
term
spirit
means
animating
or
vital
principle
in
man

it

from
the

comes
from
the
latin
word
spiritus
soul
courage
vigor
breath
and
is
related
to
spirare
to
breathe
in
the
vulgate
the
latin
word
spiritus
is
used
to
translate
the
greek
pneuma
and
hebrew
ruah
the
term
spiritual
matters
concerning
the
spirit
is
derived
from
old
french
spirituel
c
which
is
derived
from

the

nominative

there
is
no

widely

surveys
of
the

of

of

spirituality
and
the

furthermore
many
of
spirituality's
core
features
are
not
unique
to
spirituality
for
example
self-transcendence
asceticism
and
the
recognition
of
one's
connection
to
all

regarded
by
the
atheist
arthur
schopenhauer
as
key
to
ethical
life
according
to
kees
waaijman
the
traditional
meaning
of
spirituality
is
a
process
of
re-formation
which
aims
to
recover
the
original
shape
of

she
declared
her
intention

sarah
learned
that

had
died
overseas
her

summoned
a
family
council
including
morny
to
decide
what
to
do
with
her
morny
proposed
that
sarah
should
become
an
actress
an
idea
that
horrified
sarah
as
she
had
never
been
inside
a
theater
morny
arranged
for
her
to
attend
her
first
theater
performance
at
the

they
attended
was
brittanicus
by
jean

followed
by
the
classical
comedy
amphitryon
by

sarah
was
so
moved
by
the
emotion
of
the
play
she
began
to
sob
loudly
disturbing
the
rest
of
the
audience
morny
and
others
in
their
party
were
angry
at
her
and
left
but
dumas
comforted
her
and
later
told
morny
that
he
believed
that
she
was
destined
for
the
stage
after
the
performance
dumas
called
her
my

morny
used
his
influence
with
the
composer
daniel
auber
the
head
of
the
paris
conservatory
to
arrange
for
her
to
audition
she
began
preparing

she
described
it
in

with
that
vivid

and
five
leading

she
was
supposed
to
recite
verses
from
racine
but
no
one
had
told
her
that
she
needed
someone
to
give
her
cues
as
she
recited
bernhardt
told
the
jury
she
would
instead
recite
the
fable
of
the
two
pigeons
by
la
fontaine
the
jurors
were
skeptical
but
the
fervor
and
pathos
of
her
recitation
won
them
over
and
she
was
invited
to
become
a
student
bernhardt
studied
acting
at
the
conservatory
from
january
until
under
two
prominent
actors
of
the
comédie
française
joseph-isidore
samson
and
jean-baptiste
provost
she
wrote
in
her
memoirs
that
provost
taught
her
diction
and
grand
gestures
while
samson
taught
her
the
power
of
simplicity
for
the
stage
she
changed
her
name
from
bernhard
to

while
studying
she
also
received
her
first
marriage
proposal
from
a
wealthy
businessman
who
offered
her
thousand

moved
to

took
over

some
modern
historians
have
argued
that
he
was
not
from

but
instead
from
the
aragon
region
of
spain
or
from
portugal
these
competing
hypotheses
have
generally
been
discounted

his
apprenticeship
as
business
agent
for
the
important
centurione
di

he
docked

was
possibly
in

in
the
autumn
of

sailed
on

where
he
found
his

columbus
based
himself
in
lisbon
from
to
he
married
filipa

of

and
portuguese
nobleman
of

africa
reaching
the
portuguese
trading
post
of
elmina
at
the
guinea
coast
in
present-day
ghana
some
records
report
that
filipa
died
sometime
around
while
columbus
was
away
in
castile
he
returned
to
portugal
to
settle
her
estate
and
take
his
son
diego
with
him
he
had
left
portugal
for
castile
in
where
he
found
a
mistress
in
a
-year-old
orphan
named
beatriz
enríquez
de
arana
it
is
likely
that
beatriz
met
columbus
when
he
was
in
córdoba
a
gathering
site
of
many
genoese
merchants
and
where
the
court
of
the
catholic
monarchs
was
located
at
intervals
beatriz
unmarried
at
the
time
gave
birth
to
columbus's
natural
son
fernando
columbus
in
july
named
for
the
monarch
of
aragón
columbus
recognized
the
boy
as
his
offspring
columbus
entrusted
his
older
legitimate
son
diego
to
take
care
of
beatriz
and
pay
the
pension
set
aside
for
her
following
his
death
but
diego
was
negligent
in
his
duties
ambitious
columbus
eventually
learned
latin
portuguese
and
castilian
he
read
widely
about
astronomy
geography
and
history
including
the
works
of
claudius
ptolemy
cardinal
pierre
d'ailly's
imago
mundi
the
travels
of
marco
polo
and
sir
john
mandeville
pliny's
natural
history
and
pope
pius
ii's
historia
rerum
ubique
gestarum
according
to
historian
edmund
morgancolumbus
was
not
a
scholarly
man
yet
he
studied
these
books
made
hundreds
of
marginal
notations
in
them
and
came
out
with
ideas
about
the
world
that
were
characteristically
simple
and
strong
and
sometimes
wrong
throughout
his
life
columbus
also
showed
a
keen
interest
in
the
bible
and
in
biblical
prophecies
often
quoting
biblical
texts
in
his
letters
and
logs
for
example
part
of
the
argument
that
he
submitted
to
the
spanish
catholic
monarchs
when
he
sought
their
support
for
his
proposed
expedition
to
reach
the
indies
by
sailing
west
was
based
on
his
reading
of
the
second
book
of
esdras
ezra:
see
esdras
:
which
he
took
to
mean
that
the
earth
is
made
of
six
parts
of
land
to
one
of
water
towards
the
end
of
his
life
he
produced
a
book
of
prophecies
in
which
his
career
as
an
explorer
is
interpreted
in
the
light
of
christian
eschatology
and
of
apocalypticism
under
the
mongol
empire's
hegemony
over
asia
the
pax
mongolica
or

peace
europeans
had
long
enjoyed
a
safe
land
passage
the
silk
road
to
the
indies
then
construed
roughly
as
all
of
south
and
east
asia
and
china
which
were
sources
of
valuable
goods
such
as
spices
and
silk
with
the
fall
of
constantinople
to
the
ottoman
turks
in
the
land
route
to
asia
became
much
more
difficult
and
dangerous
portuguese
navigators
tried
to
find
a
sea
way
to
asia
in
the
florentine
astronomer
paolo
dal
pozzo
toscanelli
suggested
to
king
afonso
v
of
portugal
that
sailing
west
would
be
a
quicker
way
to
reach
the
spice
islands
cathay
and
cipangu
than
the
route
around
africa
afonso
rejected
his
proposal
portuguese
explorers
under
the
leadership
of
king
john
ii
then
developed
the
cape
route
to
asia
around
africa
major
progress
in
this
quest
was
achieved
in
when
bartolomeu
dias
reached
the
cape
of
good
hope
in
what
is
now
south
africa
meanwhile
in
the
the
columbus
brothers
had
picked
up
toscanelli's
suggestion
and
proposed
a
plan
to
reach
the
indies
by
sailing
west
across
the
ocean
sea
i
e
the
atlantic
however
dias's
discovery
had
shifted
the
interests
of
portuguese
seafaring
to
the
southeast
passage
which
complicated
columbus's
proposals
significantly
washington
irving's
biography
of
columbus
popularized
the
idea
that
columbus
had
difficulty
obtaining
support
for
his
plan
because
many
catholic
theologians
insisted
that
the
earth
was
flat
in
fact
nearly
all
educated
westerners
had
understood
at
least
since
the
time
of
aristotle
that
the
earth
is
spherical
the
sphericity
of
the
earth
is
also
accounted
for
in
the
work
of
ptolemy
on
which
medieval
astronomy
was
largely
based
christian
writers
whose
works
clearly
reflect
the
conviction
that
the
earth
is
spherical
include
saint
bede
the
venerable
in
his
reckoning
of
time
written
around
ad
in
columbus's
time
the
techniques
of
celestial
navigation
which
use
the
position
of
the
sun
and
the
stars
in
the
sky
together
with
the
understanding
that
the
earth
is
a
sphere
had
long
been
in
use
by
astronomers
and
were
beginning
to
be
implemented
by
mariners
as
far
back
as
the
rd
century
bc
eratosthenes
had
correctly
computed
the
circumference
of
the
earth
by
using
simple
geometry
and
studying
the
shadows
cast
by
objects
at
two
remote
locations
in
the
st
century
bc
posidonius
confirmed
eratosthenes's
results
by
comparing
stellar
observations
at
two
separate
locations
these
measurements
were
widely
known
among
scholars
but
confusion
about
the
old-fashioned
units
of
distance
in
which
they
were
expressed
led
to
some
debate
about
the
size
of
the
earth
from
d'ailly's
imago
mundi
columbus
learned
of
alfraganus's
estimate
that
a
degree
of
latitude
or
a
degree
of
longitude
along
the
equator
spanned
/
miles
but
did
not
realize
that
this
was
expressed
in
the
arabic
mile
rather
than
the
shorter
roman
mile
with
which
he
was
familiar
m
he
therefore
estimated
the
circumference
of
the
earth
to
be
about
km
whereas
the
correct
value
is
km
mi
furthermore
most
scholars
accepted
ptolemy's
estimate
that
eurasia
spanned
°
longitude
rather
than
the
actual
°
to
the
chinese
mainland
or
°
to
japan
at
the
latitude
of
spain
columbus
for
his
part
believed
the
even
higher
estimate
of
marinus
of
tyre
which
put
the
longitudinal
span
of
the
eurasian
landmass
at
°
leaving
only
°
of
water
he
also
believed
that
japan
which
he
called
cipangu
following
marco
polo
was
much
larger
farther
to
the
east
from
china
cathay
and
closer
to
the
equator
than
it
is
and
that
there
were
inhabited
islands
even
farther
to
the
east
than
japan
including
the
mythical
antillia
which
he
thought
might
lie
not
much
farther
to
the
west
than
the
azores
in
this
he
was
influenced
by
the
ideas
of
florentine
astronomer
paolo
dal
pozzo
toscanelli
who
corresponded
with
columbus
in
and
who
also
defended
the
feasibility
of
a
westward
route
to
asia
columbus
therefore
estimated
the
distance
from
the
canary
islands
to
japan
to
be
about
italian
miles
km
or
statute
miles
the
true
figure
is
now
known
to
be
vastly
larger:
about
km
no
ship
in
the
th
century
could
have
carried
enough
food
and
fresh
water
for
such
a
long
voyage
and
the
dangers
involved
in
navigating
through
the
uncharted
ocean
would
have
been
formidable
most
european
navigators
reasonably
concluded
that
a
westward
voyage
from
europe
to
asia
was
unfeasible
the
catholic
monarchs
however
having
completed
an
expensive
war
in
the
iberian
peninsula
were
eager
to
obtain
a
competitive
edge
over
other
european
countries
in
the
quest
for
trade
with
the
indies
columbus's
project
though
far-fetched
held
the
promise
of
such
an
advantage
though
columbus
was
wrong
about
the
number
of
degrees
of
longitude
that
separated
europe
from
the
far
east
and
about
the
distance
that
each
degree
represented
he
did
possess
valuable
knowledge
about
the
trade
winds
which
would
prove
to
be
the
key
to
his
successful
navigation
of
the
atlantic
ocean
during
his
first
voyage
in
the
brisk
trade
winds
from
the
east
commonly
called
easterlies
propelled
columbus's
fleet
for
five
weeks
from
the
canary
islands
to
the
bahamas
the
precise
first
land
sighting
and
landing
point
was
san
salvador
island
to
return
to
spain
against
this
prevailing
wind
would
have
required
several
months
of
an
arduous
sailing
technique
called
beating
during
which
food
and
drinkable
water
would
probably
have
been
exhausted
instead
columbus
returned
home
by
following
the
curving
trade
winds
northeastward
to
the
middle
latitudes
of
the
north
atlantic
where
he
was
able
to
catch
the
westerlies
that
blow
eastward
to
the
coast
of
western
europe
there
in
turn
the
winds
curve
southward
towards
the
iberian
peninsula
it
is
unclear
whether
columbus
learned
about
the
winds
from
his
own
sailing
experience
or
if
he
had
heard
about
them
from
others

he
also
underwent
training
for
the

the
eventual
choices
for
the

were
gagarin
and
gherman

yevgeny

believed
that
gagarin
was
very
focused
and
was
demanding
of

gagarin's

sicily
at
that
time
a
self-governing
colony
in
magna
graecia
located
along

coast
of

the
date
of
birth
is
based
on
a
statement
by
the
byzantine
greek
historian
john
tzetzes
that
archimedes
lived
for
years
in
the
sand
reckoner
archimedes
gives
his
father's
name
as
phidias
an
astronomer
about
whom
nothing
else
is
known
plutarch
wrote
in
his
parallel
lives
that
archimedes
was
related
to
king

ii
the
ruler
of
syracuse
a
biography
of
archimedes
was
written
by
his
friend
heracleides
but
this
work
has
been
lost
leaving
the
details
of
his
life
obscure
it
is
unknown
for
instance
whether
he
ever
married
or
had
children
during
his
youth
archimedes
may
have
studied
in
alexandria
egypt
where
conon
of
samos
and
eratosthenes
of
cyrene
were
contemporaries
he
referred
to
conon
of

of

forces

general

marcellus
captured
the
city
of
syracuse
after
a
two-year-long
siege
according
to
the
popular
account
given
by
plutarch
archimedes
was
contemplating
a
mathematical
diagram
when
the
city
was
captured
a
roman
soldier
commanded
him
to
come
and
meet
general
marcellus
but
he
declined
saying
that
he
had
to
finish
working
on
the
problem
the
soldier
was
enraged
by
this
and
killed
archimedes
with
his
sword
plutarch
also
gives
a
lesser-known
account
of
the
death
of
archimedes
which
suggests
that
he
may
have
been
killed
while
attempting
to
surrender
to
a
roman
soldier
according
to
this
story
archimedes
was
carrying
mathematical
instruments
and
was
killed
because
the
soldier
thought
that
they
were
valuable
items
general
marcellus
was
reportedly
angered
by
the
death
of
archimedes
as
he
considered
him
a
valuable
scientific
asset
and
had
ordered
that
he
must
not
be
harmed
marcellus
called
archimedes
a
geometrical
briareus
the
last
words
attributed
to
archimedes
are
do

my
circles

reference
to
the
circles
in
the
mathematical
drawing
that
he
was
supposedly
studying
when
disturbed
by
the
roman
soldier
this
quote
is
often
given
in
latin
as
noli
turbare
circulos
meos
but
there
is
no
reliable
evidence
that
archimedes
uttered
these
words
and
they
do
not
appear
in

account
given
by
plutarch
valerius
maximus

sides
the
family
had
lost
their
property
and
fortunes
through
patriotic
involvements
in
polish
national
uprisings
aimed
at
restoring
poland's
independence
the
most
recent
had
been
the
january
uprising
of
–
this
condemned
the
subsequent
generation
including
maria
and
her
elder
siblings
to
a
difficult
struggle
to
get
ahead
in
life
maria's
paternal
grandfather
józef
skłodowski
had
been
a
respected
teacher
in
lublin
where
he
taught
the
young
bolesław
prus
who
would
become
a
leading
figure
in
polish
literature
władysław
skłodowski
taught
mathematics
and
physics
subjects
that
maria
was
to
pursue
and
was
also
director
of
two
warsaw
gymnasia
for
boys
after
russian
authorities
eliminated
laboratory
instruction
from
the
polish
schools
he
brought
much
of
the
laboratory
equipment
home
and
instructed
his
children
in
its
use
he
was
eventually
fired
by
his
russian
supervisors
for
pro-polish
sentiments
and
forced
to
take
lower-paying
posts
the
family
also
lost
money
on
a
bad
investment
and
eventually
chose
to
supplement
their
income
by
lodging
boys
in
the
house
maria's
mother
bronisława
operated
a
prestigious
warsaw
boarding
school
for

she
resigned
from
the
position
after
maria
was
born
she
died
of

maria's
father
was

and
become
agnostic
when
she
was
ten
years
old
maria
began
attending

school
of

next
she
attended
a
gymnasium
for
girls
from
which
she
graduated
on
june
with
a
gold
medal
after
a
collapse
possibly
due
to
depression
she
spent
the
following
year
in
the
countryside
with
relatives
of
her
father
and
the
next
year
with
her
father
in
warsaw
where
she
did
some
tutoring
unable
to
enroll
in
a
regular
institution
of
higher
education

sometimes
translated

maria
made
an
agreement
with
her
sister
bronisława
that
she
would
give
her
financial
assistance
during
bronisława's
medical
studies
in
paris
in
exchange
for
similar
assistance
two
years
later
in
connection
with
this
maria
took
a
position
as
governess:
first
as
a
home
tutor
in
warsaw
then
for
two
years
as
a
governess
in
szczuki
with
a
landed
family
the
żorawskis
who
were
relatives
of
her
father
while
working
for
the
latter
family
she
fell
in
love
with
their
son
kazimierz
żorawski
a
future
eminent
mathematician
his
parents
rejected
the
idea
of
his
marrying
the
penniless
relative
and
kazimierz
was
unable
to
oppose
them
maria's
loss
of
the
relationship
with
żorawski
was
tragic
for
both
he
soon
earned
a
doctorate
and
pursued
an
academic
career
as
a
mathematician
becoming

early
from
his

a
scepticism
for

the
value
of

quantified
experimentation
an
appreciation
for
a

musical
measure
of

as

three
of

five
siblings
survived
infancy
the
youngest
michelangelo
or
michelagnolo
also
became
a
noted
lutenist
and
composer
although
he
contributed
to
financial
burdens
during
galileo's
young
adulthood
michelangelo
was
unable
to
contribute
his
fair
share
of
their
father's
promised
dowries
to
their
brothers-in-law
who
would
later
attempt
to

legal
remedies
for
payments
due
michelangelo
would
also
occasionally
have
to
borrow
funds
from
galileo
to
support
his
musical
endeavours
and
excursions
these
financial
burdens
may
have
contributed
to
galileo's
early
desire
to
develop
inventions
that
would
bring
him

galileo
galilei
was
eight
his
family
moved
to
florence
but
he
was
left
with
jacopo
borghini
for
two
years
he
was
educated
from
to
in
the
vallombrosa
abbey
about
km
southeast
of
florence
the
surname
galilei
derives
from
the
given
name
of
an
ancestor
galileo
bonaiuti
a
physician
university
teacher
and
politician
who
lived
in
florence
from
to
his
descendants
had
changed
their
family
name
from
bonaiuti
or
buonaiuti
to
galilei
in
his
honor
in
the
late
th
century
galileo
bonaiuti
was
buried
in
the
same
church
the
basilica
of
santa
croce
in
florence
where
about
years
later
his
more
famous
descendant
galileo
galilei
was
also
buried
it
was
common
for
mid-sixteenth-century
tuscan
families
to
name
the
eldest
son
after
the
parents'
surname
hence
galileo
galilei
was
not
necessarily
named
after
his
ancestor
galileo
bonaiuti
the
italian
male
given
name
galileo
and
thence
the
surname
galilei
derives
from
the
latin
galilaeus
meaning
of
galilee
a
biblically
significant
region
in
northern
israel
because
of
that
region
the
adjective
galilaios
greek
γαλιλαίος
latin
galilaeus
italian
galileo
which
means
galilean
has
been
used
in
antiquity
particularly
by
emperor
julian
to
refer
to
christ
and
his
followers
after
this
the
adjective
has
been
adopted
as
a
name
with
a
meaning
similar
to
jesus
or
christian
the
biblical
roots
of
galileo's
name
and
surname
were
to
become
the
subject
of
a
famous
pun
in
during
the
galileo
affair
one
of
galileo's
opponents
the
dominican
priest
tommaso
caccini
delivered
against
galileo
a
controversial
and
influential
sermon
in
it
he
made
a
point
of
quoting
acts
:
ye
men
of
galilee
why
stand
ye
gazing
up
into
heaven?
despite
being
a
genuinely
pious
roman
catholic
galileo
fathered
three
children
out
of
wedlock
with
marina
gamba
they
had
two
daughters
virginia
born
in
and
livia
born
in
and
a
son
vincenzo
born
in
because
of
their
illegitimate
birth
their
father
considered
the
girls
unmarriageable
if
not
posing
problems
of
prohibitively
expensive
support
or
dowries
which
would
have
been
similar
to
galileo's
previous
extensive
financial
problems
with
two
of
his
sisters
their
only
worthy
alternative
was
the
religious
life
both
girls
were
accepted
by
the
convent
of
san
matteo
in
arcetri
and
remained
there
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
virginia
took
the
name
maria
celeste
upon
entering
the
convent
she
died
on
april
and
is
buried
with
galileo
at
the
basilica
of
santa
croce
florence
livia
took
the
name
sister
arcangela
and
was
ill
for
most
of
her
life
vincenzo
was
later
legitimised
as
the
legal
heir
of
galileo
and
married
sestilia
bocchineri
although
galileo
seriously
considered
the
priesthood
as
a
young
man
at
his
father's
urging
he
instead
enrolled
in
at
the
university
of
pisa
for
a
medical
degree
in
when
he
was
studying
medicine
he
noticed
a
swinging
chandelier
which
air
currents
shifted
about
to
swing
in
larger
and
smaller
arcs
to
him
it
seemed
by
comparison
with
his
heartbeat
that
the
chandelier
took
the
same
amount
of
time
to
swing
back
and
forth
no
matter
how
far
it
was
swinging
when
he
returned
home
he
set
up
two
pendulums
of
equal
length
and
swung
one
with
a
large
sweep
and
the
other
with
a
small
sweep
and
found
that
they
kept
time
together
it
was
not
until
the
work
of
christiaan
huygens
almost
one
hundred
years
later
that
the
tautochrone
nature
of
a
swinging
pendulum
was
used
to
create
an
accurate
timepiece
up
to
this
point
galileo
had
deliberately
been
kept
away
from
mathematics
since
a
physician
earned
a
higher
income

nietzsche
grew
up
in
the
small
town
of
röcken
near
leipzig
in
the
prussian
province
of
saxony
he
was
named
after
king
friedrich
wilhelm
iv
of
prussia
who
turned
on
the
day
of
nietzsche's
birth
nietzsche
later
dropped
his

name
wilhelm
nietzsche's
parents
carl
ludwig
nietzsche
–
a
lutheran
pastor
and
former
teacher
and
franziska
nietzsche
–
married
in
the
year
before
their
son's
birth
they
had
two
other
children:
a
daughter
elisabeth
förster-nietzsche
born
in
and
a
second
son
ludwig
joseph
born
in
nietzsche's
father
died
from
a
brain
ailment
in
ludwig
joseph
died
six
months
later
at
age
two
the
family
then
moved
to
naumburg
where
they
lived
with
nietzsche's
maternal
grandmother
and
his
father's
two
unmarried
sisters
after
the
death
of
nietzsche's
grandmother
in
the
family
moved
into
their
own
house
now
nietzsche-haus
a
museum
and
nietzsche
study
centre
nietzsche
attended
a
boys'
school
and
then
a
private
school
where
he
became
friends
with
gustav
krug
rudolf
wagner
and
wilhelm
pinder
all
of
whom
came
from
highly
respected
families
in
he
began
to
attend
domgymnasium
in
naumburg
because
his
father
had
worked
for
the
state
as
a
pastor
the
now-fatherless
nietzsche
was
offered
a
scholarship
to
study
at
the
internationally
recognized
schulpforta
the
claim
that
nietzsche
was
admitted
on
the
strength
of
his
academic
competence
has
been
debunked:
his
grades
were
nowhere
near
the
top
of
the
class
he
transferred
and
studied
there
from
to
becoming
friends
with
paul
deussen
and
carl
von
gersdorff
he
also
found
time
to
work
on
poems
and
musical
compositions
nietzsche
led
germania
a
music
and
literature
club
during
his
summers
in
naumburg
at
schulpforta
nietzsche
received
an
important
grounding
in
languages—greek
latin
hebrew
and
french—so
as
to
be
able
to
read
important
primary
sources
he
also
experienced
for
the
first
time
being
away
from
his
family
life
in
a
small-town
conservative
environment
his
end-of-semester
exams
in
march
showed
a
in
religion
and
german
a
a
in
greek
and
latin
a
b
in
french
history
and
physics
and
a
lackluster
in
hebrew
and
mathematics
while
at
pforta
nietzsche
had
a
penchant
for
pursuing
subjects
that
were
considered
unbecoming
he
became
acquainted
with
the
work
of
the
then
almost-unknown
poet
friedrich
hölderlin
calling
him
my
favorite
poet
and
composing
an
essay
in
which
he
said
that
the
mad
poet
raised
consciousness
to
the
most
sublime
ideality
the
teacher
who
corrected
the
essay
gave
it
a
good
mark
but
commented
that
nietzsche
should
concern
himself
in
the
future
with
healthier
more
lucid
and
more
german
writers
additionally
he
became
acquainted
with
ernst
ortlepp
an
eccentric
blasphemous
and
often
drunken
poet
who
was
found
dead
in
a
ditch
weeks
after
meeting
the
young
nietzsche
but
who
may
have
introduced
nietzsche
to
the
music
and
writing
of
richard
wagner
perhaps
under
ortlepp's
influence
he
and
a
student
named
richter
returned
to
school
drunk
and
encountered
a
teacher
resulting
in
nietzsche's
demotion
from
first
in
his
class
and
the
end
of
his
status
as
a
prefect
after
graduation

alexander
was
born
on
the
sixth
day
of
the
ancient
greek
month
of
hekatombaion
which
probably
corresponds
to
july
bc
although
the
exact
date
is
disputed
in
pella
the
capital
of
the
kingdom
of
macedon
he
was
the
son
of
the
king
of
macedon
philip
ii
and
his
fourth
wife
olympias
the
daughter
of
neoptolemus
i
king
of
epirus
although
philip
had
seven
or
eight
wives
olympias
was
his
principal
wife
for
some
time
likely
because
she
gave
birth
to
alexander
several
legends
surround
alexander's
birth
and
childhood
according
to
the
ancient
greek
biographer
plutarch
on
the
eve
of
the
consummation
of
her
marriage
to
philip
olympias
dreamed
that
her
womb
was
struck
by
a
thunder
bolt
that
caused
a
flame
to
spread
far
and
wide
before
dying
away
sometime
after
the
wedding
philip
is
said
to
have
seen
himself
in
a
dream
securing
his
wife's
womb
with
a
seal
engraved
with
a
lion's
image
plutarch
offered
a
variety
of
interpretations
of
these
dreams:
that
olympias
was
pregnant
before
her
marriage
indicated
by
the
sealing
of
her
womb
or
that
alexander's
father
was
zeus
ancient
commentators
were
divided
about
whether
the
ambitious
olympias
promulgated
the
story
of
alexander's
divine
parentage
variously
claiming
that
she
had
told
alexander
or
that
she
dismissed
the
suggestion
as
impious
on
the
day
alexander
was
born
philip
was
preparing
a
siege
on
the
city
of
potidea
on
the
peninsula
of
chalcidice
that
same
day
philip
received
news
that
his
general
parmenion
had
defeated
the
combined
illyrian
and
paeonian
armies
and
that
his
horses
had
won
at
the
olympic
games
it
was
also
said
that
on
this
day
the
temple
of
artemis
in
ephesus
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
burnt
down
this
led
hegesias
of
magnesia
to
say
that
it
had
burnt
down
because
artemis
was
away
attending
the
birth
of
alexander
such
legends
may
have
emerged
when
alexander
was
king
and
possibly
at
his
own
instigation
to
show
that
he
was
superhuman
and
destined
for
greatness
from
conception
in
his
early
years
alexander
was
raised
by
a
nurse
lanike
sister
of
alexander's
future
general
cleitus
the
black
later
in
his
childhood
alexander
was
tutored
by
the
strict
leonidas
a
relative
of
his
mother
and
by
lysimachus
of
acarnania
alexander
was
as
a
consequence
of
roman
customs
society
and
personal
preference
augustus
classical
latin:
[awˈɡʊstʊs]
was
known
by
many
names
throughout
his
life:
gaius
octavius
thurinus
:
he
received
his
birth
name
after
his
biological
father
in
bc
gaius
was
his
praenomen
octavius
was
his
nomen
and
thurinus
was
his
cognomen
later
his
rival
mark
antony
used
the
name
thurinus
as
an
insult
to
which
augustus
replied
surprised
that
using
his
old
name
was
thought
to
be
an
insult
gaius
julius
caesar:
after
he
was
adopted
by
julius
caesar
he
adopted
caesar's
name
in
accordance
with
roman
naming
conventions
while
he
dropped
all
references
to
the
octavius
family
people
colloquially
added
the
epithet
octavianus
to
his
legal
name
either
to
differentiate
him
from
his
adoptive
father
or
to
highlight
his
more
modest
origins
modern
historians
refer
to
him
using
the
anglicized
form
octavian
between
bc
and
bc
gaius
julius
caesar
divi
filius:
two
years
after
his
adoption
he
founded
the
temple
of
caesar
additionally
adding
the
title
divi
filius
son
of
the
divine
to
his
name
in
attempt
to
strengthen
his
political
ties
to
caesar's
former
soldiers
following
the
deification
of
caesar
imperator
caesar
divi
filius:
from
bc
octavian
opted
to
use
imperator
the
title
by
which
troops
hailed
their
leader
after
military
success
his
name
is
roughly
translated
as
commander
caesar
son
of
the
divine
imperator
caesar
divi
filius
augustus:
following
his
bc
defeat
of
mark
antony
and
cleopatra
partly
on
his
own
insistence
the
roman
senate
granted
him
the
additional
name
augustus
which
he
added
to
his
previous
names
thereafter
historians
use
this
name
to
refer
to
him
from

in

a

the

he
immediately
went
on

the
forces
of
piedmont
before
their
austrian
allies
could
intervene
in
a

of
rapid

during

he
knocked

out
of

the
protracted

the
austrians
launched

scoring
victories
at
the
battles
of
castiglione
bassano
arcole

rivoli
the
decisive

had
been
defeated
by
the
archduke
charles

the
archduke
withdrew
his
forces
to
protect
vienna
after
learning
about
napoleon's
assault
in
the
first
encounter
between
the
two
commanders
napoleon
pushed
back
his
opponent
and
advanced
deep
into
austrian
territory
after
winning
at
the
battle
of
tarvis
in
march
the
austrians
were
alarmed
by
the
french
thrust
that
reached
all
the
way
to
leoben
about
km
from
vienna
and
finally
decided
to
sue
for
peace
the
treaty
of
leoben
followed
by
the
more
comprehensive
treaty
of
campo
formio
gave
france
control
of
most
of
northern
italy
and
the
low
countries
and
a
secret
clause
promised
the
republic
of
venice
to

bonaparte
marched
on
venice
and
forced
its
surrender
ending
years
of
independence
he
also
authorized
the
french
to
loot
treasures
such
as
the
horses
of
saint
mark
his
application
of
conventional
military
ideas
to
real-world
situations
enabled
his
military
triumphs
such
as
creative
use
of
artillery
as
a
mobile
force
to
support
his
infantry
he
stated
later
in
life:
i
have
fought
sixty
battles
and
i
have
learned
nothing
which
i
did
not
know
at
the
beginning
look
at
caesar
he
fought
the
first
like
the
last
bonaparte
could
win
battles
by
concealment
of
troop
deployments
and
concentration
of
his
forces
on
the
hinge
of
an
enemy's
weakened
front
if
he
could
not
use
his
favourite
envelopment
strategy
he
would
take
up
the
central
position
and
attack
two
co-operating
forces

it

captured

battles
through

tactics
during

campaign
bonaparte
became
increasingly
influential
in
french
politics
he
founded
two
newspapers:
one
for
the
troops
in
his
army
and
another
for
circulation
in
france
the
royalists
attacked
bonaparte
for
looting
italy
and
warned
that
he
might
become
a
dictator
all
told
napoleon's
forces
extracted
an
estimated
million
in
funds
from
italy
during
their
campaign
there
another
million
in
precious
metals
and
jewels
atop
that
his
forces
confiscated
more
than
three-hundred
priceless
paintings
and
sculptures
bonaparte
sent
general
pierre
augereau
to
paris
to
lead
a
coup
d'état
and
purge
the
royalists
on
september—coup
of
fructidor
this
left
barras
and
his
republican
allies
in
control
again
but
dependent
on
bonaparte
who
proceeded
to
peace
negotiations
with
austria
these
negotiations
resulted
in
the
treaty
of
campo
formio
and
bonaparte
returned
to
paris
in
december
as
a
hero
he
met
talleyrand
france's
new
foreign
minister—who
served
in
the
same
capacity
for
emperor
napoleon—and
they
began
to
prepare
for
an
invasion
of
britain
after
two
months
of
planning
bonaparte
decided
that
france's
naval
power
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
confront
the
british
royal
navy
he
decided
on
a
military
expedition
to
seize
egypt
and
thereby
undermine
britain's
access
to
its
trade
interests
in
india
bonaparte
wished
to
establish
a
french
presence
in
the
middle

a
muslim
enemy
scholars
are
hesitant
to
make
unqualified
claims
about
the
historical
facts
of
the
buddha's
life
most
people
accept
that
the
buddha
lived
taught
and
founded
a
monastic

during

during

reign
of

empire
and
died
during
the
early
years
of
the
reign
of
ajatasatru
who
was
the
successor
of
bimbisara
thus
making
him
a

contemporary
of

while
the
general
sequence
of

and

teaching

is
widely
accepted
there
is
less
consensus
on
the
veracity
of
many
details
contained
in
traditional
biographies
the
times
of
gautama's
birth
and
death
are
uncertain
most
historians
in
the
early
th
century
dated
his
lifetime
as
c
bce
to
bce
more
recently
his
death
is
dated
later
between

bce
while
at
a
symposium
on
this
question
held
in
the
majority
of
those
who
presented
definite
opinions
gave
dates
within
years
either
side
of
bce
for
the
buddha's
death
these
alternative
chronologies
however
have
not
been
accepted
by
all
historians
the
evidence
of
the
early
texts
suggests
that
siddhārtha
gautama
was
born
into
the
shakya
clan
a
community
that
was
on
the
periphery
both
geographically
and
culturally
of
the
eastern
indian
subcontinent
in
the
th
century
bce
one
of
his
usual
names
was
sakamuni
or
sakyamunī
sage
of
the
shakyas
it
was
either
a
small
republic
or
an
oligarchy
and
his
father
was
an
elected
chieftain
or
oligarch
according
to
the
buddhist
tradition
gautama
was
born
in
lumbini
now
in
modern-day
nepal
and
raised
in
the
shakya
capital
of
kapilvastu
which
may
have
been
either
in
what
is
present
day
tilaurakot
nepal
or
piprahwa
india
he
obtained
his
enlightenment
in
bodh
gaya
gave
his
first
sermon
in
sarnath
and
died
in
kushinagar
apart
from
the
vedic
brahmins
the
buddha's
lifetime
coincided
with
the
flourishing
of
influential
śramaṇa
schools
of
thought
like
ājīvika
cārvāka
jainism
and
ajñana
brahmajala

in
this
context
a
śramaṇa
refers
to
one
who
labors

exerts
themselves
for
some
higher

religious
purpose
it
was

the

kassapa
makkhali
gosāla
ajita
kesakambalī
pakudha
kaccāyana
and

the

certainly
must
have
been
acquainted

the

depicts

engaging
in
debate
with
the
adherents

there
is
also
philological
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
two
masters
alara
kalama
and
uddaka
ramaputta
were
indeed
historical
figures
and
they
most
probably
taught
buddha
two
different
forms
of
meditative
techniques
thus
buddha
was
just
one
of
the
many
śramaṇa
philosophers
of
that
time
in
an
era
where
holiness
of
person
was
judged
by
their
level
of
asceticism
buddha
was
a
reformist
within
the
śramaṇa
movement
rather
than
a
reactionary
against
vedic
brahminism

had

name
sometimes
supplemented
with
the

in

joshua
the

yeshua
appears
to
have
been
in
use
in

of
the
birth

the
etymology
of
jesus'
name
in
the
context
of
the
new
testament
is
generally
given
as
yahweh
is
salvation
since
early
christianity
christians
have
commonly
referred
to
jesus
as
jesus
christ
the
word
christ
was
a
title
or
office
the
christ
not
a
given
name
it
derives
from
the
greek
χριστός
christos
a
translation
of
the
hebrew
mashiakh
משיח
meaning
anointed
and
is
usually
transliterated
into
english
as
messiah
in
biblical
judaism
sacred
oil
was
used
to
anoint
certain
exceptionally
holy
people
and
objects
as
part
of
their
religious
investiture
see
leviticus
:–
and
exodus
:
christians
of
the
time
designated
jesus
as
the
christ
because
they
believed
him
to
be
the
messiah
whose
arrival
is
prophesied
in
the
hebrew
bible
and
old
testament
in
postbiblical
usage
christ
became
viewed
as
a
name—one
part
of
jesus
christ
the
term
christian
meaning
a
follower
of
christ
has
been
in
use
since
the
st
century
the
four
canonical
gospels
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
are
the
foremost
sources
for
the
life
and
message
of
jesus
however
other
parts
of
the
new
testament
also
include
references
to
key
episodes
in
his
life
such
as
the
last
supper
in
corinthians
:
acts
of
the
apostles

about

also
mentioned
in
timothy

than
the
canonical
gospels
do
in
the
undisputed
pauline
letters
which
were
written
earlier
than

the
words
or
instructions
of
jesus
are
cited
several
times
corinthians

corinthians
:
some
early
christian
groups
had
separate
descriptions
of
the
life
and
teachings
of
jesus
that
are
not
included
in
the
new
testament
these
include
the
gospel
of
thomas
gospel
of
peter
and
gospel
of
judas
the
apocryphon
of
james
and
many
other
apocryphal
writings
most
scholars
conclude
that
these
are
written
much
later
and
are
less
reliable
accounts
than
the
canonical
gospels
the
canonical
gospels
are
four
accounts
each
written
by
a
different
author
the
authors
of
the
gospels
are
all
anonymous
attributed
by
tradition
to
the
four
evangelists
each
with
close
ties
to
jesus:
mark
by
john
mark
an
associate
of
peter
matthew
by
one
of
jesus'
disciples
luke
by
a
companion
of
paul
mentioned
in
a
few
epistles
and
john
by
another
of
jesus'
disciples
the
beloved
disciple
one
important
aspect
of
the
study
of
the
gospels
is
the
literary
genre
under
which
they
fall
genre
is
a
key
convention
guiding
both
the
composition
and
the
interpretation
of
writings
whether
the
gospel
authors
set
out
to
write
novels
myths
histories
or
biographies
has
a
tremendous
impact
on
how
they
ought
to
be
interpreted
some
recent
studies
suggest
that
the
genre
of
the
gospels
ought
to
be
situated
within
the
realm
of
ancient
biography
although
not
without
critics
the
position
that
the
gospels
are
a
type
of
ancient
biography
is
the
consensus
among
scholars
today
not
everything
contained
in
the
new
testament
gospels
is
considered
to
be
historically
reliable
views
range
from
their
being
inerrant
descriptions
of
the
life
of
jesus
to
their
providing
little
historical
information
about
his
life
beyond
the
basics
according
to
a
broad
scholarly
consensus
the
synoptic
gospels
matthew
mark
and
luke
and
not
john
are
the
most
reliable
sources
of
information
about
jesus
according
to
the
marcan
priority
the
first
to
be
written
was
the
gospel
of
mark
written
ad
–
followed
by
the
gospel
of
matthew
ad
–
the
gospel
of
luke
ad
–
and
the
gospel
of
john
ad
–
furthermore
most
scholars
agree
that
the
authors
of
matthew
and
luke
used
mark
as
a
source
when
writing
their
gospels
matthew
and
luke
also
share
some
content
not
found
in
mark
to
explain
this
many
scholars
believe
that
in
addition
to
mark
another
source
commonly
called
the
q
source
was
used
by
the
two
authors
matthew
mark
and
luke
are
known
as
the
synoptic
gospels
from
the
greek
σύν
syn
together
and
ὄψις
opsis
view
they
are
similar
in
content
narrative
arrangement
language
and
paragraph
structure
scholars
generally
agree
that
it
is
impossible
to
find
any
direct
literary
relationship
between
the
synoptic
gospels
and
the
gospel
of
john
while
the
flow
of
some
events
such
as
jesus'
baptism
transfiguration
crucifixion
and
interactions
with
the
apostles
are
shared
among
the
synoptic
gospels
incidents
such
as
the
transfiguration
do
not
appear
in
john
which
also
differs
on
other
matters
such
as
the
cleansing
of
the
temple
the
synoptics
emphasize
different
aspects
of
jesus
in
mark
jesus
is
the
son
of
god
whose
mighty
works
demonstrate
the
presence
of
god's
kingdom
he
is
a
tireless
wonder
worker
the
servant
of
both
god
and
man
this
short
gospel
records
few
of
jesus'
words
or
teachings
the
gospel
of
matthew
emphasizes
that
jesus
is
the
fulfillment
of
god's
will
as
revealed
in
the
old
testament
and
he
is
the
lord
of
the
church
he
is
the
son
of
david
a
king
and
the
messiah
luke
presents
jesus
as
the
divine-human
savior
who
shows
compassion
to
the
needy
he
is
the
friend
of
sinners
and
outcasts
come
to
seek
and
save
the
lost
this
gospel
includes
jesus'
most
beloved
parables
such
as
the
good
samaritan
and
the
prodigal
son
the
prologue
to
the
gospel
of
john
identifies
jesus
as
an
incarnation
of
the
divine
word
logos
as
the
word
jesus
was
eternally
present
with
god
active
in
all
creation
and
the
source
of
humanity's
moral
and
spiritual
nature
jesus
is
not
only
greater
than
any
past
human
prophet
but
greater
than
any
prophet
could
be
he
not
only
speaks
god's
word
he
is
god's
word
in
the
gospel
of
john
jesus
reveals
his
divine
role
publicly
here
he
is
the
bread
of
life
the
light
of
the
world
the
true
vine
and
more
in
general
the
authors
of
the
new
testament
showed
little
interest
in
an
absolute
chronology
of
jesus
or
in
synchronizing
the
episodes
of
his
life
with
the
secular
history
of
the
age
as
stated
in
john
:
the
gospels
do
not
claim
to
provide
an
exhaustive
list
of
the
events
in
the
life
of
jesus
the
accounts
were
primarily
written
as
theological
documents
in
the
context
of
early
christianity
with
timelines
as
a
secondary
consideration
in
this
respect
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
gospels
devote
about
one
third
of
their
text
to
the
last
week
of
the
life
of
jesus
in
jerusalem
referred
to
as
the
passion
although
the
gospels
do
not
provide
enough
details
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
modern
historians
regarding
exact
dates
it
is
possible
to
draw
from
them
a
general
picture
of
the
life
story
of
jesus
jesus
was
jewish
born
by
mary
wife
of
joseph
matthew
luke
the
gospels
of
matthew
and
luke
offer
two
accounts
of
the
genealogy
of
jesus
matthew
traces
jesus'
ancestry
to
abraham
through
david
luke
traces
jesus'
ancestry
through
adam
to
god
the
lists
are
identical
between
abraham
and
david
but
differ
radically
from
that
point
matthew
has
twenty-seven
generations
from
david
to
joseph
whereas
luke
has
forty-two
with
almost
no
overlap
between
the
names
on
the
two
lists
various
theories
have
been
put
forward
seeking
to
explain
why
the
two
genealogies
are
so
different
matthew
and
luke
each
describe
jesus'
nativity
or
birth
especially
that
jesus
was
born
by
a
virgin
mary
in
bethlehem
in
fulfillment
of
prophecy
luke's
account
emphasizes
events
before
the
birth
of
jesus
and
centers
on
mary
while
matthew's
mostly
covers
those
after
the
birth
and
centers
on
joseph
both
accounts
state
that
jesus
was
born
to
joseph
and
mary
his
betrothed
in
bethlehem
and
both
support
the
doctrine
of
the
virgin
birth
of
jesus
according
to
which
jesus
was
miraculously
conceived
by
the
holy
spirit
in
mary's
womb
when
she
was
still
a
virgin
at
the
same
time
there
is
evidence
at
least
in
the
lukan
acts
of
the
apostles
that
jesus
was
thought
to
have
had
like
many
figures
in
antiquity
a
dual
paternity
since
there
it
is
stated
he
descended
from
the
seed
or
loins
of
david
in
matthew
joseph
is
troubled
because
mary
his
betrothed
is
pregnant
matthew
:–
but
in
the
first
of
joseph's
three
dreams
an
angel
assures
him
not
to
be
afraid
to
take
mary
as
his
wife
because
her
child
was
conceived
by
the
holy
spirit
in
matthew
:–
wise
men
or
magi
from
the
east
bring
gifts
to
the
young
jesus
as
the
king
of
the
jews
herod
the
great
hears
of
jesus'
birth
and
wanting
him
killed
orders
the
murders
of
male
infants
in
bethlehem
but
an
angel
warns
joseph
in
his
second
dream
and
the
family
flees
to
egypt—later
to
return
and
settle
in
nazareth
in
luke
:–
mary
learns
from
the
angel
gabriel
that
she
will
conceive
and
bear
a
child
called
jesus
through
the
action
of
the
holy
spirit
when
mary
is
due
to
give
birth
she
and
joseph
travel
from
nazareth
to
joseph's
ancestral
home
in
bethlehem
to
register
in
the
census
ordered
by
caesar
augustus
while
there
mary
gives
birth
to
jesus
and
as
they
have
found
no
room
in
the
inn
she
places
the
newborn
in
a
manger
luke
:–
an
angel
announces
the
birth
to
some
shepherds
who
go
to
bethlehem
to
see
jesus
and
subsequently
spread
the
news
abroad
luke
:–
after
the
presentation
of
jesus
at
the
temple
joseph
mary
and
jesus
return
to
nazareth
jesus'
childhood
home
is
identified
in
the
gospels
of
luke
and
matthew
as
the
town
of
nazareth
in
galilee
where
he
lived
with
his
family
although
joseph
appears
in
descriptions
of
jesus'
childhood
no
mention
is
made
of
him
thereafter
his
other
family
members—his
mother
mary
his
brothers
james
joses
or
joseph
judas
and
simon
and
his
unnamed
sisters—are
mentioned
in
the
gospels
and
other
sources
the
gospel
of
mark
reports
that
jesus
comes
into
conflict
with
his
neighbors
and
family
jesus'
mother
and
brothers
come
to
get
him
mark
:–
because
people
are
saying
that
he
is
crazy
mark
:
jesus
responds
that
his
followers
are
his
true
family
in
john
mary
follows
jesus
to
his
crucifixion
and
he
expresses
concern
over
her
well-being
john
:–
jesus
is
called
a
τέκτων
tektōn
in
mark
:
traditionally
understood
as
carpenter
but
could
cover
makers
of
objects
in
various
materials
including
builders
the
gospels
indicate
that
jesus
could
read
paraphrase
and
debate
scripture
but
this
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
received
formal
scribal
training
when
jesus
is
presented
as
a
baby
in
the
temple
per
jewish
law
a
man
named
simeon
says
to
mary
and
joseph
that
jesus
shall
stand
as
a
sign
of
contradiction
while
a
sword
will
pierce
your
own
soul
then
the
secret
thoughts
of
many
will
come
to
light
luke
:–
several
years
later
when
jesus
goes
missing
on
a
visit
to
jerusalem
his
parents
find
him
in
the
temple
sitting
among
the
teachers
listening
to
them
and
asking
questions
and
the
people
are
amazed
at
his
understanding
and
answers
mary
scolds
jesus
for
going
missing
to
which
jesus
replies
that
he
must
be
in
his
father's
house
luke
:–
the
synoptic
accounts
of
jesus'
baptism
are
all
preceded
by
information
about
john
the
baptist
they
show
john
preaching
penance
and
repentance
for
the
remission
of
sins
and
encouraging
the
giving
of
alms
to
the
poor
luke
:
as
he
baptizes
people
in

area
of
the
jordan
river
around

and
foretells
luke
:
the
arrival
of
someone
more
powerful

john
as
the
elijah

was
to
come

the
prophet
who
was

to
arrive
before

baptizes

as
he
comes
out

descending
to
him
like
a
dove
and
he
hears
a
voice
from
heaven
declaring
him
to
be
god's
son
mark
:–
this
is
one
of
two
events
described
in
the
gospels
where
a
voice
from
heaven
calls
jesus
son
the
other
being
the
transfiguration
the
spirit
then
drives
him
into
the
wilderness
where
he
is

by
satan

jesus
then
begins
his
ministry
after
john's
arrest
mark
:
jesus'
baptism
in
matthew
is
similar
here
before
jesus'
baptism
john
protests
saying
i
need
to
be
baptized
by
you
matthew
:
jesus
instructs
him
to
carry
on
with
the
baptism
to
fulfill
all
righteousness
matthew

matthew

details
the
three
temptations
that
satan
offers
jesus
in

wilderness
matthew

the
holy
spirit
descends
as
a
dove
after
everyone
has
been
baptized

is
praying

john
implicitly
recognizes
jesus
from
prison
after
sending
his
followers
to
ask
about
him
luke
:–
jesus'
baptism
and
temptation
serve
as
preparation
for
his
public
ministry
the
gospel
of
john
leaves
out
jesus'
baptism
and
temptation
here
john
the
baptist
testifies
that
he
saw
the
spirit
descend
on
jesus
john
:
john
publicly
proclaims
jesus
as
the
sacrificial
lamb
of
god
and
some
of
john's
followers
become
disciples
of
jesus
in
this
gospel
john
denies
that
he
is
elijah
john
:
before
john
is
imprisoned
jesus
leads
his
followers
to
baptize
disciples
as
well
john
:–
and
they
baptize
more
people
than
john
john
:
the
synoptics
depict
two
distinct
geographical
settings
in
jesus'
ministry
the
first
takes
place
north
of
judea
in
galilee
where
jesus
conducts
a
successful
ministry
and
the
second
shows
jesus
rejected
and
killed
when
he
travels
to
jerusalem
often
referred
to
as
rabbi
jesus
preaches
his
message
orally
notably
jesus
forbids
those
who
recognize
him
as
the
messiah
to
speak
of
it
including
people
he
heals
and
demons
he
exorcises
see
messianic
secret
john
depicts
jesus'
ministry
as
largely
taking
place
in
and
around
jerusalem
rather
than
in
galilee
and
jesus'
divine
identity
is
openly
proclaimed
and
immediately
recognized
scholars
divide
the
ministry
of
jesus
into
several
stages
the
galilean
ministry
begins
when
jesus
returns
to
galilee
from
the
judaean
desert
after
rebuffing
the
temptation
of
satan
jesus
preaches
around
galilee
and
in
matthew
:–
his
first
disciples
who
will
eventually
form
the
core
of
the
early
church
encounter
him
and
begin
to
travel
with
him
this
period
includes
the
sermon
on
the
mount
one
of
jesus'
major
discourses
as
well
as
the
calming
of
the
storm
the
feeding
of
the
walking
on
water
and
a
number
of
other
miracles
and
parables
it
ends
with
the
confession
of
peter
and
the
transfiguration
as
jesus
travels
towards
jerusalem
in
the
perean
ministry
he
returns
to
the
area
where
he
was
baptized
about
a
third
of
the
way
down
from
the
sea
of
galilee
along
the
jordan
river
john
:–
the
final
ministry
in
jerusalem
begins
with
jesus'
triumphal
entry
into
the
city
on
palm
sunday
in
the
synoptic
gospels
during
that
week
jesus
drives
the
money
changers
from
the
second
temple
and
judas
bargains
to
betray
him
this
period
culminates
in
the
last
supper
and
the
farewell
discourse
near
the
beginning
of
his
ministry
jesus
appoints
twelve
apostles
in
matthew
and
mark
despite
jesus
only
briefly
requesting
that
they
join
him
jesus'
first
four
apostles
who
were
fishermen
are
described
as
immediately
consenting
and
abandoning
their
nets
and
boats
to
do
so
matthew
:–
mark
:–
in
john
jesus'
first
two
apostles
were
disciples
of
john
the
baptist
the
baptist
sees
jesus
and
calls
him
the
lamb
of
god
the
two
hear
this
and
follow
jesus
in
addition
to
the
twelve
apostles
the
opening
of
the
passage
of
the
sermon
on
the
plain
identifies
a
much
larger
group
of
people
as
disciples
luke
:
also
in
luke
:–
jesus
sends
seventy
or
seventy-two
of
his
followers
in
pairs
to
prepare
towns
for
his
prospective
visit
they
are
instructed
to
accept
hospitality
heal
the
sick
and
spread
the
word
that
the
kingdom
of
god
is
coming
in
mark
the
disciples
are
notably
obtuse
they
fail
to
understand
jesus'
miracles
mark
:–
mark
:
his
parables
mark
:
or
what
rising
from
the
dead
would
mean
mark
:–
when
jesus
is
later
arrested
they
desert
him
in
the
synoptics
jesus
teaches
extensively
often
in
parables
about
the
kingdom
of
god
or
in
matthew
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
kingdom
is
described
as
both
imminent
mark
:
and
already
present
in
the
ministry
of
jesus
luke
:
jesus
promises
inclusion
in
the
kingdom
for
those
who
accept
his
message
mark
:–
jesus
talks
of
the
son
of
man
an
apocalyptic
figure
who
would
come
to
gather
the
chosen
jesus
calls
people
to
repent
their
sins
and
to
devote
themselves
completely
to
god
jesus
tells
his
followers
to
adhere
to
jewish
law
although
he
is
perceived
by
some
to
have
broken
the
law
himself
for
example
regarding
the
sabbath
when
asked
what
the
greatest
commandment
is
jesus
replies:
you
shall
love
the
lord
your
god
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
your
soul
and
with
all
your
mind
and
a
second
is
like
it:
'you
shall
love
your
neighbor
as
yourself
matthew
:–
other
ethical
teachings
of
jesus
include
loving
your
enemies
refraining
from
hatred
and
lust
turning
the
other
cheek
and
forgiving
people
who
have
sinned
against
you
matthew
–
john's
gospel
presents
the
teachings
of
jesus
not
merely
as
his
own
preaching
but
as
divine
revelation
john
the
baptist
for
example
states
in
john
::
he
whom
god
has
sent
speaks
the
words
of
god
for
he
gives
the
spirit
without
measure
in
john
:
jesus
says
my
teaching
is
not
mine
but
his
who
sent
me
he
asserts
the
same
thing
in
john
::
do
you
not
believe
that
i
am
in
the
father
and
the
father
is
in
me?
the
words
that
i
say
to
you
i
do
not
speak
on
my
own
but
the
father
who
dwells
in
me
does
his
works
approximately
thirty
parables
form
about
one
third
of
jesus'
recorded
teachings
the
parables
appear
within
longer
sermons
and
at
other
places
in
the
narrative
they
often
contain
symbolism
and
usually
relate
the
physical
world
to
the
spiritual
common
themes
in
these
tales
include
the
kindness
and
generosity
of
god
and
the
perils
of
transgression
some
of
his
parables
such
as
the
prodigal
son
luke
:–
are
relatively
simple
while
others
such
as
the
growing
seed
mark
:–
are
sophisticated
profound
and
abstruse
when
asked
by
his
disciples
about
why
he
speaks
in
parables
to
the
people
jesus
replies
that
the
chosen
disciples
have
been
given
to
know
the
secrets
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
unlike
the
rest
of
their
people
for
the
one
who
has
will
be
given
more
and
he
will
have
in
abundance
but
the
one
who
does
not
have
will
be
deprived
even
more
going
on
to
say
that
the
majority
of
their
generation
have
grown
dull
hearts
and
thus
are
unable
to
understand
matthew
:–
in
the
gospel
accounts
jesus
devotes
a
large
portion
of
his
ministry
performing
miracles
especially
healings
the
miracles
can
be
classified
into
two
main
categories:
healing
miracles
and
nature
miracles
the
healing
miracles
include
cures
for
physical
ailments
exorcisms
and
resurrections
of
the
dead
the
nature
miracles
show
jesus'
power
over
nature
and
include
turning
water
into
wine
walking
on
water
and
calming
a
storm
among
others
jesus
states
that
his
miracles
are
from
a
divine
source
when
jesus'
opponents
suddenly
accuse
him
of
performing
exorcisms
by
the
power
of
beelzebul
the
prince
of
demons
jesus
counters
that
he
performs
them
by
the
spirit
of
god
matthew
:
or
finger
of
god
arguing
that
all
logic
suggests
that
satan
would
not
let
his
demons
assist
the
children
of
god
because
it
would
divide
satan's
house
and
bring
his
kingdom
to
desolation
furthermore
he
asks
his
opponents
that
if
he
exorcises
by
beel'zebub
by
whom
do
your
sons
cast
them
out?luke
:
in
matthew
:–
he
goes
on
to
say
that
while
all
manner
of
sin
even
insults
against
god
or
insults
against
the
son
of
man
shall
be
forgiven
whoever
insults
goodness
or
the
holy
spirit
shall
never
be
forgiven
he/she
carries
the
guilt
of
his/her
sin
forever
in
john
jesus'
miracles
are
described
as
signs
performed
to
prove
his
mission
and
divinity
however
in
the
synoptics
when
asked
by
some
teachers
of
the
law
and
some
pharisees
to
give
miraculous
signs
to
prove
his
authority
jesus
refuses
saying
that
no
sign
shall
come
to
corrupt
and
evil
people
except
the
sign
of
the
prophet
jonah
also
in
the
synoptic
gospels
the
crowds
regularly
respond
to
jesus'
miracles
with
awe
and
press
on
him
to
heal
their
sick
in
john's
gospel
jesus
is
presented
as
unpressured
by
the
crowds
who
often
respond
to
his
miracles
with
trust
and
faith
one
characteristic
shared
among
all
miracles
of
jesus
in
the
gospel
accounts
is
that
he
performed
them
freely
and
never
requested
or
accepted
any
form
of
payment
the
gospel
episodes
that
include
descriptions
of
the
miracles
of
jesus
also
often
include
teachings
and
the
miracles
themselves
involve
an
element
of
teaching
many
of
the
miracles
teach
the
importance
of
faith
in
the
cleansing
of
ten
lepers
and
the
raising
of
jairus'
daughter
for
instance
the
beneficiaries
are
told
that
their
healing
was
due
to
their
faith
at
about
the
middle
of
each
of
the
three
synoptic
gospels
are
two
significant
events:
the
confession
of
peter
and
the
transfiguration
of
jesus
these
two
events
are
not
mentioned
in
the
gospel
of
john
in
his
confession
peter
tells
jesus
you
are
the
messiah
the
son
of
the
living
god
jesus
affirms
that
peter's
confession
is
divinely
revealed
truth
after
the
confession
jesus
tells
his
disciples
about
his
upcoming
death
and
resurrection

unnamed
mountain

them

his
face
shone
like
the
sun

his
clothes
became

a

the
description
of
the
last
week
of
the
life
of

often
called
passion

about
one
third
of

narrative
in

canonical
gospels

triumphal
entry
into

and
ending
with

synoptics

of

journey
through
perea

judea

began
in

end
john
:–
jesus
comes
into
conflict
with
the
jewish
elders
such
as
when
they
question
his
authority
and
when
he
criticizes
them
and
calls
them
hypocrites
judas

of
the
twelve
apostles
secretly
strikes
a
bargain
with
the
jewish
elders
agreeing
to
betray
jesus
to
them
for
silver
coins
the
gospel
of
john
recounts
of
two
other
feasts
in
which
jesus
taught
in
jerusalem
before
the
passion
week
john
:–:
in
bethany
a
village
near
jerusalem
jesus
raises
lazarus
from
the
dead
this
potent
sign
increases
the
tension
with
authorities
who
conspire
to
kill
him
john
mary
of
bethany
anoints
jesus'
feet
foreshadowing
his
entombment
jesus
then
makes
his
messianic
entry
into
jerusalem
the
cheering
crowds
greeting
jesus
as
he
enters
jerusalem
add
to
the
animosity
between
him
and
the
establishment
in
john
jesus
has
already
cleansed
the
second
temple
during
an
earlier
passover
visit
to
jerusalem
john
next
recounts
jesus'
last
supper
with
his
disciples
the
last
supper
is
the
final
meal
that
jesus
shares
with
his
apostles
in
jerusalem
before
his
crucifixion
the
last
supper
is
mentioned
in
all
four
canonical
gospels
paul's
first
epistle
to
the
corinthians
:–
also
refers
to
it
during
the
meal
jesus
predicts
that
one
of
his
apostles
will
betray
him
despite
each
apostle's
assertion
that
he
would
not
betray
him
jesus
reiterates
that
the
betrayer
would
be
one
of
those
present
matthew
:–
and
john
:–
specifically
identify
judas
as
the
traitor
in
the
synoptics
jesus
takes
bread
breaks
it
and
gives
it
to
the
disciples
saying
this
is
my
body
which
is
given
for
you
he
then
has
them
all
drink
from
a
cup
saying
this
cup
that
is
poured
out
for
you
is
the
new
covenant
in
my
blood
luke
:–
the
christian
sacrament
or
ordinance
of
the
eucharist
is
based
on
these
events
although
the
gospel
of
john
does
not
include
a
description
of
the
bread-and-wine
ritual
during
the
last
supper
most
scholars
agree
that
john
:–
the
bread
of
life
discourse
has
a
eucharistic
character
and
resonates
with
the
institution
narratives
in
the
synoptic
gospels
and
in
the
pauline
writings
on
the
last
supper
in
all
four
gospels
jesus
predicts
that
peter
will
deny
knowledge
of
him
three
times
before
the
rooster
crows
the
next
morning

john
the
prediction
is
made
during
the
supper
luke
:
john
:
in
matthew
and
mark
the
prediction
is
made
after
the
supper
jesus
also
predicts
that
all
his
disciples
will
desert
him
matthew
:–
mark
:–
the
gospel
of
john
provides
the
only
account
of
jesus
washing
his
disciples'
feet
after
the
meal
john
also
includes
a
long
sermon
by
jesus
preparing
his
disciples
now
without
judas
for
his
departure
chapters
–
of
the
gospel
of
john
are
known
as
the
farewell
discourse
and
are
a
significant
source
of
christological
content
in
the
synoptics
jesus
and
his
disciples
go
to
the
garden
gethsemane
where
jesus
prays
to
be
spared
his
coming
ordeal
then
judas
comes
with
an
armed
mob
sent
the
eventual
demarcation
of
philosophy
from
science
was
made
possible
by
the
notion
that
philosophy's
core
was
theory
of
knowledge
a
theory
distinct
from
the
sciences
because
it
was
their
foundation
without
this
idea
of
a
theory
of
knowledge
it
is
hard
to
imagine
what
philosophy
could
have
been
in
the
age
of
modern
science
the
definition
of
knowledge
is
a
matter
of
ongoing
debate
among
philosophers
in
the
field
of
epistemology
the
classical
definition
described
but
not
ultimately
endorsed
by
plato
specifies
that
a
statement
must
meet
three
criteria
in
order
to
be
considered
knowledge:
it
must
be
justified
true
and
believed
some
claim
that
these
conditions
are
not
sufficient
as
gettier
case
examples
allegedly
demonstrate
there
are
a
number
of
alternatives
proposed
including
robert
nozick's
arguments
for
a
requirement
that
knowledge
'tracks
the
truth'
and
simon
blackburn's
additional
requirement
that
we
do
not
want
to
say
that
those
who
meet
any
of
these
conditions
'through
a
defect
flaw
or
failure'
have
knowledge
richard
kirkham
suggests
that
our
definition
of
knowledge
requires
that
the
earliest
written
form
of
the
germanic
word
god
comes
from
the
th-century
christian
codex
argenteus
the
english
word
itself
is
derived
from
the
proto-germanic
ǥuđan
the
reconstructed
proto-indo-european
form
ǵhu-tó-m
was
likely
based
on
the
root
ǵhauə-
which
meant
either
to
call
or
to
invoke
the
germanic
words
for
god
were
originally
neuter—applying
to
both
genders—but
during
the
process
of
the
christianization
of
the
germanic
peoples
from
their
indigenous
germanic
paganism
the
words
became
a
masculine
syntactic
form
in
the
english
language
capitalization
is
used
for
names
by
which
a
god
is
known
including
'god'
consequently
the
capitalized
form
of
god
is
not
used
for
multiple
gods
polytheism
or
when
used
to
refer
to
the
generic
idea
of
a
deity
the
english
word
god
and
its
counterparts
in
other
languages
are
normally
used
for
any
and
all
conceptions
and
in
spite
of
significant
differences
between
religions
the
term
remains
an
english
translation
common
to
all
the
same
holds
for
hebrew
el
but
in
judaism
god
is
also
given
a
proper
name
the
tetragrammaton
yhwh
in
origin
possibly
the
name
of
an
edomite
or
midianite
deity
yahweh
in
many
translations
of
the
bible
when
the
word
lord
is
in
all
capitals
it
signifies
that
the
word
represents
the
tetragrammaton
allāh
arabic:
الله‎
is
the
arabic
term
with
no
plural
used
by
muslims
and
arabic
speaking
christians
and
jews
meaning
the
god
with
the
first
letter
capitalized
while
ʾilāh
arabic:
إله‎
is
the
term
used
for
a
deity
or
a
god
in
general
god
may
also
be
given
a
proper
name
in
monotheistic
currents
of
hinduism
which
emphasize
the
personal
nature
of
god
with
early
references
to
his
name
as
krishna-vasudeva
in
bhagavata
or
later
vishnu
and
hari

the

it
is
generally

waheguru
is
also
described
by
some
as
an
experience
of
ecstasy
which
is
beyond
all
descriptions
the
most
common
usage
of

baha
the

for

there
is
no
clear
consensus
on
the
nature
or
the
existence
of
god
the
abrahamic
conceptions
of
god
include
the
monotheistic
definition
of
god
in
judaism
the
trinitarian
view
of
christians
and
the
islamic
concept
of
god
the
dharmic
religions
differ
in
their
view
of
the
divine:
views
of
god
in
hinduism
vary
by
region
sect
and
caste
ranging
from
monotheistic
to
polytheistic
many
polytheistic
religions
share
the
idea
of
a
creator
deity
although
having
a
name
other
than
god
and
without
all
of
the
other
roles
attributed
to
a
singular
god
by
monotheistic
religions
jainism
is
polytheistic
and
non-creationist
depending
on
one's
interpretation
and
tradition
buddhism
can
be
conceived
as
being
either
atheistic
non-theistic
pantheistic
panentheistic
or
polytheistic
monotheists
hold
that
there
is
only
one
god
and
may
claim
that
the
one
true
god
is
worshiped
in
different
religions
under
different
names
the
view
that
all
theists
actually
worship
the
same
god
whether
they
know
it
or
not
is
especially
emphasized
in
the
bahá'í
faith
hinduism
and
sikhism
in
christianity
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
describes
god
as
one
god
in
three
divine
persons
each
of
the
three
persons
is
god
himself
the
most
holy
trinity
comprises
god
the
father
god
the
son
which
is
jesus
christ
god
and
god
the
holy
spirit
in
the
past
centuries
this
fundamental
mystery
of
the
christian
faith
was
also
summarized
by
the
latin
formula
sancta
trinitas
unus
deus
holy
trinity
unique
god
reported
in
the
litanias
lauretanas
islam's
most
fundamental
concept
is
tawhid
meaning
oneness
or
uniqueness
god
is
described
in
the
quran
as:
say:
he
is
allah
the
one
and
only
allah
the
eternal
absolute
he
begetteth
not
nor
is
he
begotten
and
there
is
none
like
unto
him
muslims
repudiate
the
christian
doctrine
of
the
trinity
and
the
divinity
of
jesus
comparing
it
to
polytheism
in
islam
god
is
transcendent
and
does
not
resemble
any
of
his
creations
in
any
way
thus
muslims
are
not
iconodules
and
are
not
expected
to
visualize
god
henotheism
is
the
belief
and
worship
of
a
single
god
while
accepting
the
existence
or
possible
existence
of
other
deities
theism
generally
holds
that
god
exists
realistically
objectively
and
independently
of
human
thought
that
god
created
and
sustains
everything
that
god
is
omnipotent
and
eternal
and
that
god
is
personal
and
interacting
with
the
universe
through
for
example
religious
experience
and
the
prayers
of
humans
theism
holds
that
god
is
both
transcendent
and
immanent
thus
god
is
simultaneously
infinite
and
in
some
way
present
in
the
affairs
of
the
world
not
all
theists
subscribe
to
all
of
these
propositions
but
each
usually
subscribes
to
some
of
them
see
by
way
of
comparison
family
resemblance
catholic
theology
holds
that
god
is
infinitely
simple
and
is
not
involuntarily
subject
to
time
most
theists
hold
that
god
is
omnipotent
omniscient
and
benevolent
although
this
belief
raises
questions
about
god's
responsibility
for
evil
and
suffering
in
the
world
some
theists
ascribe
to
god
a
self-conscious
or
purposeful
limiting
of
omnipotence
omniscience
or
benevolence
open
theism
by
contrast
contends
that
due
to
the
nature
of
time
god's
omniscience
does
not
mean
the
modern
english
word
soul
derived
from
old
english
sáwol
sáwel
was
first
attested
in

poem

deeper
etymology
of

the
original
concept
behind
the

thought
to
mean
“coming
from
or
belonging
to

because

unlike
other
ancient
near
eastern
gods
the
hebrew
god
is
portrayed
as
unitary
and
solitary
consequently
the
hebrew
god's
principal
relationships
are
not
with
other
gods
but
with
the
world
and
more
specifically
with
the
people
he
created
judaism
thus
begins
with
ethical
monotheism:
the
belief
that
god
is
one
and
is
concerned
with
the
actions
of
mankind
according
to
the
tanakh
hebrew
bible
god
promised
abraham
to
make
of
his
offspring
a
great
nation
many
generations
later
he
commanded
the
nation
of
israel
to
love
and
worship
only
one
god
that
is
the
jewish
nation
is
to
reciprocate
god's
concern
for
the
world
he
also
commanded
the
jewish
people
to
love
one
another
that
is
jews
are
to
imitate
god's
love
for
people
these
commandments
are
but
two
of
a
large
corpus
of
commandments
and
laws
that
constitute
this
covenant
which
is
the
substance
of
judaism
thus
although
there
is
an
esoteric
tradition
in
judaism
kabbalah
rabbinic
scholar
max
kadushin
has
characterized
normative
judaism
as
normal
mysticism
because
it
involves
everyday
personal
experiences
of
god
through
ways
or
modes
that
are
common
to
all
jews
this
is
played
out
through
the
observance
of
the
halakha
jewish
law
and
given
verbal
expression
in
the
birkat
ha-mizvot
the
short
blessings
that
are
spoken
every
time
a
positive
commandment
is
to
be
fulfilled
the
ordinary
familiar
everyday
things
and
occurrences
we
have
constitute
occasions
for
the
experience
of
god
such
things
as
one's
daily
sustenance
the
very
day
itself
are
felt
as
manifestations
of
god's
loving-kindness
calling
for
the
berakhot
kedushah
holiness
which
is
nothing
else
than
the
imitation
of
god
is
concerned
with
daily
conduct
with
being
gracious
and
merciful
with
keeping
oneself
from
defilement
by
idolatry
adultery
and
the
shedding
of
blood
the
birkat
ha-mitzwot
evokes
the
consciousness
of
holiness
at
a
rabbinic
rite
but
the
objects
employed
in
the
majority
of
these
rites
are
non-holy
and
of
general
character
while
the
several
holy
objects
are
non-theurgic
and
not
only
do
ordinary
things
and
occurrences
bring
with
them
the
experience
of
god
everything
that
happens
to
a
man
evokes
that
experience
evil
as
well
as
good
for
a
berakah
is
said
also
at
evil
tidings
hence
although
the
experience
of
god
is
like
none
other
the
occasions
for
experiencing
him
for
having
a
consciousness
of
him
are
manifold
even
if
we
consider
only
those
that
call
for
berakot
whereas
jewish
philosophers
often
debate
whether
god
is
immanent
or
transcendent
and
whether
people
have
free
will
or
their
lives
are
determined
halakha
is
a
system
through
which
any
jew
acts
to
bring
god
into
the
world
ethical
monotheism
is
central
in
all
sacred
or
normative
texts
of
judaism
however
monotheism
has
not
always
been
followed
in
practice
the
jewish
bible
tanakh
records
and
repeatedly
condemns
the
widespread
worship
of
other
gods
in
ancient
israel
in
the
greco-roman
era
many
different
interpretations
of
monotheism
existed
in
judaism
including
the
interpretations
that
gave
rise
to
christianity
moreover
some
have
argued
that
judaism
is
a
non-creedal
religion
that
does
not
require
one
to
believe
in
god
for
some
observance
of
jewish
law
is
more
important
than
belief
in
god
per
se
in
modern
times
some
liberal
jewish
movements
do
not
accept
the
existence
of
a
personified
deity
active
in
history
the
debate
about
whether
one
can
speak
of
authentic
or
normative
judaism
is
not
only
a
debate
among
religious
jews
but
also
among
historians
scholars
throughout
jewish
history
have
proposed
numerous
formulations
of
judaism's
core
tenets
all
of
which
have
met
with
criticism
the
most
popular
formulation
is
maimonides'
thirteen
principles
of
faith
developed
in
the
th
century
according
to
maimonides
any
jew
who
rejects
even
one
of
these
principles
would
be
considered
an
apostate
and
a
heretic
jewish
scholars
have
held
points
of
view
diverging
in
various
ways
from
maimonides'
principles
in
maimonides'
time
his
list
of
tenets
was
criticized
by
hasdai
crescas
and
joseph
albo
albo
and
the
raavad
argued
that
maimonides'
principles
contained
too
many
items
that
while
true
were
not
fundamentals
of
the
faith
along
these
lines
the
ancient
historian
josephus
emphasized
practices
and
observances
rather
than
religious
beliefs
associating
apostasy
with
a
failure
to
observe
jewish
law
and
maintaining
that
the
requirements
for
conversion
to
judaism
included
circumcision
and
adherence
to
traditional
customs
maimonides'
principles
were
largely
ignored
over
the
next
few
centuries
later
two
poetic
restatements
of
these
principles
ani
ma'amin
and
yigdal
became
integrated
into
many
jewish
liturgies
leading
to
their
eventual
near-universal
acceptance
in
modern
times
judaism
lacks
a
centralized
authority
that
would
dictate
an
exact
religious
dogma
because
of
this
many
different
variations
on
the
basic
beliefs
are
considered
within
the
scope
of
judaism
even
so
all
jewish
religious
movements
are
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
based
on
the
principles
of
the
hebrew
bible
and
various
commentaries
such
as
the
talmud
and
midrash
judaism
also
universally
recognizes
the
biblical
covenant
between
god
and
the
patriarch
abraham
as
well
as
the
additional
aspects
of
the
covenant
revealed
to
moses
who
is
considered
judaism's
greatest
prophet
in
the
mishnah
a
core
text
of
rabbinic
judaism
acceptance
of
the
divine
origins
of
this
covenant
is
considered
an
essential
aspect
of
judaism
and
those
who
reject
the
covenant
forfeit
their
share
in
the
world
to
come
establishing
the
core
tenets
of
judaism
in
the
modern
era
is
even
more
difficult
given
the
number
and
diversity
of
the
contemporary
jewish
denominations
even
if
to
restrict
the
problem
to
the
most
influential
intellectual
trends
of
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
century
the
matter
remains
complicated
thus
for
instance
joseph
soloveitchik's
associated
with
the
modern
orthodox
movement
answer
to
modernity
is
constituted
upon
the
identification
of
judaism
with
following
the
halakha
whereas
its
ultimate
goal
is
to
bring
the
holiness
down
to
the
world
mordecai
kaplan
the
founder
of
the
reconstructionist
judaism
abandons
the
idea
of
religion
for
the
sake
of
identifying
judaism
with
civilization
and
by
means
of
the
latter
term
and
secular
translation
of
the
core
ideas
he
tries
to
embrace
as
many
jewish
denominations
as
possible
in
turn
solomon
schechter's
conservative
judaism
was
identical
with
the
tradition
understood
as
the
interpretation
of
torah
in
itself
being
the
history
of
the
constant
updates
and
adjustment
of
the
law
performed
by
means
of
the
creative
interpretation
finally
david
philipson
draws
the
outlines
of
the
reform
movement
in
judaism
by
opposing
it
to
the
strict
and
traditional
rabbinical
approach
and
thus
comes
to
the
conclusions
similar
to
that
of
the
conservative
movement

were

from
him
transmitted
and
taught
to
the

centuries

appeared
only

transmitted
in
parallel
with
the
oral
tradition
fearing
that
the
oral
teachings
might
be
forgotten
rabbi
judah
hanasi
undertook
the
mission
of
consolidating
the
various
opinions
into
one
body
of
law
which
became
known
as
the
mishnah
the
mishnah
consists
of
tractates
codifying
jewish
law
which
are
the
basis
of
the
talmud
according
to
abraham
ben
david
the
mishnah
was
compiled
by
rabbi
judah
hanasi
after
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
in
anno
mundi
which
corresponds
to
ce
over
the
next
four
centuries
the
mishnah
underwent
discussion
and
debate
in
both
of
the
world's
major
jewish
communities
in
israel
and
babylonia
the
commentaries
from
each
of

were
eventually
compiled

two
talmuds
the

talmud
talmud

have

orthodox
and
many
other
jews
do
not
believe
that
the
revealed
torah
consists
solely
of
its
written
contents
but
of
its
interpretations
as
well
the
study
of
torah
in
its
widest
sense
to
include
both
poetry
narrative
and
law
and
both
the
hebrew
bible
and
the
talmud
is
in
judaism
itself
a
sacred
act
of
central
importance
for
the
sages
of
the
mishnah
and
talmud
and
for
their
successors
today
the
study
of
torah
was
therefore
not
merely
a
means
to
learn
the
contents
of
god's
revelation
but
an
end
in
itself
according
to
the
talmud
these
are
the
things
for
which
a
person
enjoys
the
dividends
in
this
world
while
the
principal
remains
for
the
person
to
enjoy
in
the
world
to
come
they
are:
honoring
parents
loving
deeds
of
kindness
and
making
peace
between
one
person
and
another
but
the
study
of
the
torah
is
equal
to
them
all
talmud
shabbat
a
in
judaism
the
study
of
torah
can
be
a
means
of
experiencing
god
reflecting
on
the
contribution
of
the
amoraim
and
tanaim
to
contemporary
judaism
professor
jacob
neusner
observed:
the
rabbi's
logical
and
rational
inquiry
is
not
mere
logic-chopping
it
is
a
most
serious
and
substantive
effort
to
locate
in
trivialities
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
revealed
will
of
god
to
guide
and
sanctify
the
most
specific
and
concrete
actions
in
the
workaday
world
here
is
the
mystery
of
talmudic
judaism:
the
alien
and
remote
conviction
that
the
intellect
is
an
instrument
not
of
unbelief
and
desacralization
but
of
sanctification
to
study
the
written
torah
and
the
oral
torah
in
light
of
each
other
is
thus
also
to
study
how
to
study
the
word
of
god
in
the
study
of
torah
the
sages
formulated
and
followed
various
logical
and
hermeneutical
principles
according
to
david
stern
all
rabbinic
hermeneutics
rest
on
two
basic
axioms:
first
the
belief
in
the
omni-significance
of
scripture
in
the
meaningfulness
of
its
every
word
letter
even
according
to
one
famous
report
scribal
flourish
second
the
claim
of
the
essential
unity
of
scripture
as
the
expression
of
the
single
divine
will
these
two
principles
make
possible
a
great
variety
of
interpretations
according
to
the
talmud
a
single
verse
has
several
meanings
but
no
two
verses
hold
the
same
meaning
it
was
taught
in
the
school
of
r
ishmael:
'behold
my
word
is
like
fire—declares
the
lord—and
like
a
hammer
that
shatters
rock'
jer
:
just
as
this
hammer
produces
many
sparks
when
it
strikes
the
rock
so
a
single
verse
has
several
meanings
talmud
sanhedrin
a
observant
jews
thus
view
the
torah
as
dynamic
because
it
contains
within
it
a
host
of
interpretationsaccording
to
rabbinic
tradition
all
valid
interpretations
of
the
written
torah
were
revealed
to
moses
at
sinai
in
oral
form
and
handed
down
from
teacher
to
pupil
the
oral
revelation
is
in
effect
coextensive
with
the
talmud
itself
when
different
rabbis
forwarded
conflicting
interpretations
they
sometimes
appealed
to
hermeneutic
principles
to
legitimize
their
arguments
some
rabbis
claim
that
these
principles
were
themselves
revealed
by
god
to
moses
at
sinai
thus
hillel
called
attention
to
seven
commonly
used
hermeneutical
principles
in
the
interpretation
of
laws

nevertheless
r
ishmael's
principles
are
perhaps
the
ones
most
widely
known
they
constitute
an
important
and
one
of
judaism's
earliest
contributions

and
jurisprudence
judah

incorporated

principles
into

in

th
century
today

prayer

by

on
a
daily
basis
the
term
judaism
derives
from
iudaismus
a
latinized
form
of
the
ancient
greek
ioudaismos
ἰουδαϊσμός
from
the
verb
ἰουδαΐζειν
to
side
with
or
imitate
the
[judeans]
its
ultimate
source
was
the
hebrew
יהודה
yehudah
judah
which
is
also
the
source
of
the
hebrew
term
for
judaism:
יַהֲדוּת
yahadut
the
term
ἰουδαϊσμός
first
appears
in
the
hellenistic
greek
book
of
maccabees
in
the
nd
century
bce
in
the
context
of
the
age
and
period
it
meant
seeking
or
forming
part
of
a
cultural
entity
and
it
resembled
its
antonym
hellenismos
a
word
that
signified
a
people's
submission
to
hellenic
greek
cultural
norms
the
conflict
between
iudaismos
and
hellenismos
lay
behind
the
maccabean
revolt
and
hence
the
invention
of
the
term
iudaismos
shaye
j
d
cohen
writes
in
his
book
the
beginnings
of
jewishness:
we
are
tempted
of
course
to
translate
[ioudaïsmós]
as
judaism
but
this
translation
is
too
narrow
because
in
this
first
occurrence
of
the
term
ioudaïsmós
has
not
yet
been
reduced
to
the
designation
of
a
religion
it
means
rather
the
aggregate
of
all
those
characteristics
that
makes
judaeans
judaean
or
jews
jewish
among
these
characteristics
to
be
sure
are
practices
and
beliefs
that
we
would
today
call
religious
but
these
practices
and
beliefs
are
not
the
sole
content
of
the
term
thus
ioudaïsmós
should
be
translated
not
as
judaism
but
as
judaeanness
according
to
the
oxford
english
dictionary
the
earliest
citation
in
english
where
the
term
was
used
to
mean
the
profession
or
practice
of
the
jewish
religion
the
religious
system
or
polity
of
the
jews
is
robert
fabyan's
the
newe
cronycles
of
englande
and
of
fraunce
judaism
as
a
direct
translation
of
the
latin
iudaismus
first
occurred
in
a
english
translation
of
the
apocrypha
deuterocanon
in
catholic
and
eastern
orthodoxy
macc
ii
:
those
that
behaved
themselves
manfully
to
their
honour
for
iudaisme
according
to
daniel
boyarin
the
underlying
distinction
between
religion
and
ethnicity
is
foreign
to
judaism
itself
and
is
one
form
of
the
dualism
between
spirit
and
flesh
that
has
its
origin
in
platonic
philosophy
and
that
permeated
hellenistic
judaism
consequently
in
his
view
judaism
does
not
fit
easily
into
conventional
western
categories
such
as
religion
ethnicity
or
culture
boyarin
suggests
that
this
in
part
reflects
the
fact
that
much
of
judaism's
more
than
-year
history
predates
the
rise
of
western
culture
and
occurred
outside
the
west
that
is
europe
particularly
medieval
and
modern
europe
during
this
time
jews
experienced
slavery
anarchic
and
theocratic
self-government
conquest
occupation
and
exile
in
the
diaspora
they
were
in
contact
with
and
influenced
by
ancient
egyptian
babylonian
persian
and
hellenic
cultures
as
well
as
modern
movements
such
as
the
enlightenment
see
haskalah
and
the
rise
of
nationalism
which
would
bear
fruit
in
the
form
of
a
jewish
state
in
their
ancient
homeland
the
land
of
israel
they
also
saw
an
elite
population
convert
to
judaism
the
khazars
only
to
disappear
as
the
centers
of
power
in
the
lands
once
occupied
by
that
elite
fell
to
the
people
of
rus
and
then
the
mongols
thus
boyarin
has
argued
that
jewishness
disrupts
the
very
categories
of
identity
because
it
is
not
national
not
genealogical
not
religious
but
all
of
these
in
dialectical
tension
in
contrast
to
this
point
of
view
practices
such
as
humanistic
judaism
reject
the
religious
aspects
of
judaism
while
retaining
certain
cultural
traditions
according
to
rabbinic
judaism
a
jew
is
anyone
who
was
either
born
of
a
jewish
mother
or
who
converted
to
judaism
in
accordance
with
jewish
law
reconstructionist
judaism
and
the
larger
denominations
of
worldwide
progressive
judaism
also
known
as
liberal
or
reform
judaism
accept
the
child
as
jewish
if
one
of
the
parents
is
jewish
if
the
parents
raise
the
child
with
a
jewish
identity
but
not
the
smaller
regional
branches
all
mainstream
forms
of
judaism
today
are
open
to
sincere
converts
although
conversion
has
traditionally
been
discouraged
since
the
time
of
the
talmud
the
conversion
process
is
evaluated
by
an
authority
and
the
convert
is
examined
on
his
or
her
sincerity
and
knowledge
converts
are
called
ben
abraham
or
bat
abraham
son
or
daughter
of
abraham
conversions
have
on
occasion
been
overturned
in
israel's
highest
religious
court
invalidated
the
conversion
of
jews
mostly
from
russian
immigrant
families
even
though
they
had
been
approved
by
an
orthodox
rabbi
rabbinical
judaism
maintains
that
a
jew
whether
by
birth
or
conversion
is
a
jew
forever
thus
a
jew
who
claims
to
be
an
atheist
or
converts
to
another
religion
is
still
considered
by
traditional
judaism
to
be
jewish
according
to
some
sources
the
reform
movement
has
maintained
that
a
jew
who
has
converted
to
another
religion
is
no
longer
a
jew
and
the
israeli
government
has
also
taken
that
stance
after
supreme
court
cases
and
statutes
however
the
reform
movement
has
indicated
that
this
is
not
so
cut
and
dried
and
different
situations
call
for
consideration
and
differing
actions
for
example
jews
who
have
converted
under
duress
may
be
permitted
to
return
to
judaism
without
any
action
on
their
part
but
their
desire
to
rejoin
the
jewish
community
and
a
proselyte
who
has
become
an
apostate
remains
nevertheless
a
jew
karaite
judaism
believes
that
jewish
identity
can
only
be
transmitted
by
patrilineal
descent
although
a
minority
of
modern
karaites
believe
that
jewish
identity
requires
that
both
parents
be
jewish
and
not
only
the
father
they
argue
that
only
patrilineal
descent
can
transmit
jewish
identity
on
the
grounds
that
all
descent
in
the
torah
went
according
to
the
male
line
the
question
of
what
determines
jewish
identity
in
the
state
of
israel
was
given
new
impetus
when
in
the
david
ben-gurion
requested
opinions
on
mihu
yehudi
who
is
a
jew
from
jewish
religious
authorities
and
intellectuals
worldwide
in
order
to
settle
citizenship
questions
this
is
still
not
settled
and
occasionally
resurfaces
in
israeli
politics
historical
definitions
of
jewish
identity
have
traditionally
been
based
on
halakhic
definitions
of
matrilineal
descent
and
halakhic
conversions
historical
definitions
of
who
is
a
jew
date
back
to
the
codification
of

the
babylonian

around
ce
interpretations
of
sections
of
the
tanakh
such
as
deuteronomy
:–
by
jewish
sages
are
used
as
a
warning
against
intermarriage
between
jews
and
canaanites
because
[the
non-jewish
husband]
will
cause
your
child
to
turn
away
from
me
and
they
will
worship
the
gods
i
e
idols
of
others
leviticus
:
says
that
the
son
in
a
marriage
between
a
hebrew
woman
and
an
egyptian
man
is
of
the
community
of
israel
this
is
complemented
by
ezra
:–
where
israelites
returning
from
babylon
vow
to
put
aside
their
gentile
wives
and
their
children
a
popular
theory
is
that
the
rape
of
jewish
women
in
captivity
brought
about
the
law
of
jewish
identity
being
inherited
through
the
maternal
line
although
scholars
challenge
this
theory
citing
the
talmudic
establishment
of
the
law
from
the
pre-exile
period
since
the
anti-religious
haskalah
movement
of
the
late
th
and
th
centuries
halakhic
interpretations
of
jewish
identity
have
been
challenged
the
total
number
of
jews
worldwide
is
difficult
to
assess
because
the
definition
of
who
is
a
jew
is
problematic
not
all
jews
identify
themselves
as
jewish
and
some
who
identify
as
jewish
are
not
considered
so
by
other
jews

haredi
judaism
is
less
accommodating
to

and
has
less
interest
in
non-jewish
disciplines
and
it
may
be
distinguished
from

characterized

non-fundamentalist

an
acceptance

conservative
judaism
teaches
that
jewish
law
is
not
static
but
has
always
developed
in
response
to
changing
conditions
it
holds
that
the
torah
is
a

and
reflecting

rejects
the

position

one
of
the
primary
functions
of
the
family
involves
providing
a
framework
for
the
production
and
reproduction
of
persons
biologically
and
socially
this
can
occur
through

and
obligations
and
moral
and
sentimental
ties
thus
one's
experience
of
one's
family
shifts
over
time
from
the
perspective
of
children
the
family
is
a
family
of
orientation:
the
family
serves
to
locate
children
socially
and
plays
a
major
role
in
their
enculturation
and
socialization
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
parents
the
family
is
a
family
of
procreation
the
goal
of
which
is
to
produce
and
enculturate
and
socialize
children
however
producing
children
is
not
the
only
function
of
the
the
word
comes
from
the
same
greek
word
from
which
the
title
of
aristotle's
book
politics
πολιτικά
polis
also
derives
polis
means
affairs
of
the
cities
the
book
title
was
rendered
in
early
modern
english
in
the
mid-th
century
as
polettiques
it
became
politics
in
modern
english
the
singular
politic
first
attested
in
english
and
comes
from
middle
french
politique
in
turn
from
latin
politicus
which
is
the
latinization
of
the
greek
πολιτικός
politikos
meaning
amongst
others
of
for
or
relating
to
citizens
civil
civic
belonging

formal
politics
refers
to
the
operation
of
a
constitutional
system
of
government
and
publicly
defined
institutions
and
procedures
political
parties
public
policy
or
discussions
about
war
and
foreign
affairs
would
fall
under
the
category
of
formal
politics
many
people
view
formal
politics
as
something
outside
of
themselves
but
that
can
still
affect
their
daily
lives
semi-formal
politics
is
politics
in
government
associations
such
as
neighborhood
associations
or
student
governments
where
student
government
political
party
politics
is
often
important
informal
politics
is
understood
as
forming
alliances
exercising
power
and
protecting
and
advancing
particular
ideas
or
goals
generally
this
includes
anything
affecting
one's
daily
life
such
as
the
way
an
office
or
household
is
managed
or
how
one
person
or
group
exercises
influence
over
another
informal
politics
is
typically
understood
as
everyday
politics
hence
the
idea
that
politics
is
everywhere
the
history
of
politics
is
reflected
in
the
origin
development
and
economics
of
the
institutions
of
government
the
origin
of
the
state
is
to
be
found
in
the
development
of
the
art
of
warfare
historically
speaking
all
political
communities
of
the
modern
type
owe
their
existence
to
successful
warfare
kings
emperors
and
other
types
of
monarchs
in
many
countries
including
china
and
japan
were
considered
divine
of
the
institutions
that
ruled
states
that
of
kingship
stood
at
the
forefront
until
the
american
revolution
put
an
end
to
the
divine
right
of
kings
nevertheless
the
monarchy
is
among
the
longest-lasting
political
institutions
dating
as
early
as
bc
in
sumeria
to
the
st
century
ad
british
monarchy
kingship
becomes
an
institution
through
the
institution
of
hereditary
monarchy
the
king
often
even
in
absolute
monarchies
ruled
his
kingdom
with
the
aid
of
an
elite
group
of
advisors
a
council
without
which
he
could
not
maintain
power
as
these
advisors
and
others
outside
the
monarchy
negotiated
for
power
constitutional
monarchies
emerged
which
may
be
considered
the
germ
of
constitutional
government
the
greatest
of
the
king's
subordinates
the
earls
and
dukes
in
england
and
scotland
the
dukes
and
counts
in
the
continent
always
sat
as
a
right
on
the
council
a
conqueror
wages
war
upon
the
vanquished
for
vengeance
or
for
plunder
but
an
established
kingdom
exacts
tribute
one
of
the
functions
of
the
council
is
to
keep
the
coffers
of
the
king
full
another
is
the
satisfaction
of
military
service
and
the
establishment
of
lordships
by
the
king
to
satisfy
the
task
of
collecting
taxes
and
soldiers
there
are
many
forms
of
political
organization
including
states
non-government
organizations
ngos
and
international
organizations
such
as
the
united
nations
states
are
perhaps
the
predominant
institutional
form
of
political
governance
where
a
state
is
understood
as
an
institution
and
a
government
is
understood
as
the
regime
in
power
according
to
aristotle
states
are
classified
into
monarchies
aristocracies
timocracies
democracies
oligarchies
and
tyrannies
due
to
changes
across
the
history
of
politics
this
classification
has
been
abandoned
all
states
are
varieties
of
a
single
organizational
form
the
sovereign

all
the
great

of
the
modern

rule
on
the
principle
of

sovereign
power
may
be
vested
on
an

in
an
autocratic

it
may
be
vested
on
a

the
word
money
is
believed
to
originate
from
a
temple
of
juno
on
capitoline
one
of
rome's
seven
hills
in
the
ancient
world
juno
was
often
associated
with
money
the
temple
of
juno
moneta
at
rome
was
the
place
where
the
mint
of
ancient
rome
was
located
the
name
juno
may
derive
from
the
etruscan
goddess
uni
which
means
the
one
unique
unit
union
united
and
moneta
either
from
the
latin
word
monere
remind
warn
or
instruct
or
the
greek
word
moneres
alone
unique
in
the
western
world
a
prevalent
term
for
coin-money
has
been
specie
stemming
from
latin
in
specie
meaning
'in
kind'
the
use
of
barter-like
methods
may
date
back
to
at
least
years
ago
though
there
is
no
evidence
of
a
society
or
economy
that
relied
primarily
on
barter
instead
non-monetary
societies
operated
largely
along
the
principles
of
gift
economy
and
debt
when
barter
did
in
fact
occur
it
was
usually
between
either
complete
strangers
or
potential
enemies
many
cultures
around
the
world
eventually
developed
the
use
of
commodity
money
the
mesopotamian
shekel
was
a
unit
of
weight
and
relied
on
the
mass
of
something
like
grains
of
barley
the
first
usage
of
the
term
came
from
mesopotamia
circa
bc
societies
in
the
americas
asia
africa
and
australia
used
shell
money
–
often
the
shells
of
the
cowry
cypraea
moneta
l
or
c
annulus
l
according
to
herodotus
the
lydians
were
the
first
people
to
introduce
the
use
of
gold
and
silver
coins
it
is
thought
by
modern
scholars
that
these
first
stamped
coins
were
minted
around
–
bc
the
system
of
commodity
money
eventually
evolved
into
a
system
of
representative
money
this
occurred
because
gold
and
silver
merchants
or
banks
would
issue
receipts
to
their
depositors
–
redeemable
for
the
commodity
money
deposited
eventually
these
receipts
became
generally
accepted
as
a
means
of
payment
and
were
used
as
money
paper
money
or
banknotes
were
first
used
in
china
during
the
song
dynasty
these
banknotes
known
as
jiaozi
evolved
from
promissory
notes
that
had
been
used
since
the
th
century
however
they
did
not
displace
commodity
money
and
were
used
alongside
coins
in
the
th
century
paper
money
became
known
in
europe
through
the
accounts
of
travelers
such
as
marco
polo
and
william
of
rubruck
marco
polo's
account
of
paper
money
during
the
yuan
dynasty
is
the
subject
of
a
chapter
of
his
book
the
travels
of
marco

titled
how
the
great
kaan
causeth
the
bark
of
trees
made
into
something
like
paper
to
pass
for
money
all
over
his
country
banknotes
were
first
issued
in
europe
by
stockholms
banco
in
and
were
again
also
used
alongside
coins
the
gold
standard
a
monetary
system
where
the
medium
of
exchange
are
paper
notes
that
are
convertible
into
pre-set
fixed
quantities
of
gold
replaced
the
use
of
gold
coins
as
currency
in
the
th–th
centuries
in
europe
these
gold
standard
notes
were
made
legal
tender
and
redemption
into
gold
coins
was
discouraged
by
the
beginning
of
the
th
century
almost
all
countries
had
adopted
the
gold
standard
backing
their
legal
tender
notes
with
fixed
amounts
of
gold
after
world
war
ii
and
the
bretton
woods
conference
most
countries
adopted
fiat
currencies
that
were
fixed
to
the
dollar
the
dollar
was
in
turn
fixed
to
gold
in
the
government
suspended
the
convertibility
of
the
dollar
to
gold
after
this
many
countries
de-pegged
their
currencies
from
the
dollar
and
most
of
the
world's
currencies
became
unbacked
by
anything
except
the
governments'
fiat
of
legal
tender
and
the
ability
to
convert
the
money
into
goods
via
payment
according
to
proponents
of
modern
money
theory
fiat
money
is
also
backed
by
taxes
by
imposing
taxes
states
create
demand
for
the
currency
they
issue
in
money
and
the
mechanism
of
exchange
william
stanley
jevons
famously
analyzed
money
in
terms
of
four
functions:
a
medium
of
exchange
a
common
measure
of
value
or
unit
of
account
a
standard
of
value
or
standard
of
deferred
payment
and
a
store
of
value
by
jevons's
four
functions
of
money
were
summarized
in
the
couplet:
money's
a
matter
of
functions
four
a
medium
a
measure
a
standard
a
store
this
couplet
would
later
become
widely
popular
in
macroeconomics
textbooks
most
modern
textbooks
now
list
only
three
functions
that
of
medium
of
exchange
unit
of
account
and
store
of
value
not
considering
a
standard
of
deferred
payment
as
a
distinguished
function
but
rather
subsuming
it
in
the
others
there
have
been
many
historical
disputes
regarding
the
combination
of
money's
functions
some
arguing
that
they
need
more
separation
and
that
a
single
unit
is
insufficient
to
deal
with
them
all
one
of
these
arguments
is
that
the
role
until
the
middle
of
the
th
century
there
were
no
organized
and/or
well-established
army
nursing
systems
for
casualties
and
no
safe
and
protected
institutions
to
accommodate
and
treat
those
who
were
wounded
on
the
battlefield
a
devout
reformed
christian
the
swiss
businessman
jean-henri
dunant
in
june
traveled
to
italy
to
meet
french
emperor
napoléon
iii
with
the
intention
of
discussing
difficulties
in
conducting
business
in
algeria
at
that
time
occupied
by
france
he
arrived
in
the
small
town
of
in
the
century
prior
to
the
un's
creation
several
international
treaty
organizations
such
as
the
international
committee
of
the
red
cross
was
formed
to
ensure
protection
and
assistance
for
victims
of
armed
conflict
and
strife
following
the
catastrophic
loss
of
life
in
the
first
world
war
the
paris
peace
conference
established
the
league
of
nations
with
a
brief
to
prevent
war
settle
disputes
and
improve
peoples'
lives
across
the
globe
however
the
league
was
ineffective
as
it
failed
to
act
against
the
japanese
invasion
of
manchuria
as
in
february
nations
voted
for
japan
to
withdraw
from
manchuria
but
japan
voted
against
it
and
walked
out
of
the
league
instead
of
withdrawing
from
manchuria
it
also
failed
against
the
second
italo-ethiopian
war
as
both
italy
and
ethiopia
are
both
members
of
the
league
so
the
league
was
unable
to
control
italy
or
protect
ethiopia
therefore
italy
had
conquered
ethiopia
it
also
failed
in
the
japanese
invasion
of
china

root
word
mil-the
first
recorded
use
of
the
word
military
in
english
spelled
militarie
was
in
it
comes
from
the
latin
militaris
from
latin
miles
meaning
soldier
through
french
but
is
of
uncertain
etymology
one
suggestion
being
derived
from
mil-it-
–
going
in
a
body
or
mass
the
word
is
now
identified
as
denoting
someone
that
is
skilled
in
use
of
weapons
or
engaged
in
military
service
or
in
warfare
as
a
noun
the
military
usually
refers
generally
to
a
country's
armed
forces
or
sometimes
more
specifically
to
the
senior
officers
who
command
them
in
general
it
refers
to
the
physicality
of
armed
forces
their
personnel

and
the
physical
area
which
they
occupy
as
an
adjective
military
originally
referred
only
to
soldiers
and
soldiering
but
it
soon
broadened
to
apply
to
land
forces
in
general
and
anything
to
do
with
their
profession
the
names
of
both
the
royal
military
academy
and
united
states
military
academy
reflect
this
however
at
about
the
time
of
the
napoleonic
wars
'military'
began
to
be
used
in
reference
to
armed
forces
as
a
whole
and
in
the
st
century
expressions
like
'military
service'
'military
intelligence'
and
'military
history'
encompass
naval
and
air
force
aspects
as
such
it
now
connotes
any
activity
performed
by

personnel
military
history
is
often
considered
to
be
the
history
of
all
conflicts
not
just
the
history
of
the
state
militaries
it
differs
somewhat
from
the
history
of
war
with
military
history
focusing
on
the
people
and
institutions
of
war-making
while
the
history
of
war
focuses
on
the
evolution
of
war
itself
in
the
face
of
changing
technology
governments
and
geography
military
history
has
a
number
of
facets
one
main
facet
is
to
learn
from
past
accomplishments
and
mistakes
so
as
to
more
effectively
wage
war
in
the
future
another
is
to
create
a
sense
of
military
tradition
which
is
used
to
create
cohesive
military
forces
still
another
may
be
to
learn
to
prevent
wars
more
effectively
human
knowledge
about
the
military
is
largely
based
on
both
recorded
and
oral
history
of
military
conflicts
war
their
participating
the
english
word
war
derives
from
the
late
old
english
circa
words
wyrre
and
werre
from
old
french
werre
also
guerre
as
in
modern
french
in
turn
from
the
frankish
werra
ultimately
deriving
from
the
proto-germanic
werzō
'mixture
confusion'
the
word
is
related
to
the
old
saxon
werran
old
high
german
werran
and
the
german
verwirren
meaning
“to
confuse”

modern
military
science
considers
several
factors
before
a

policy
is
created
to
allow
a

to
commence:
the
environment
in

adopt
on
the
commencement
of
a

engaged
in
asymmetric
warfare
is
a
conflict
between
belligerents
of

warfare
is
the
use
of

is
warfare
in

the
earliest
recorded
evidence
of
war
belongs
to
the
mesolithic
cemetery
site
which
has
been
determined
to
be
approximately
years
old
about
forty-five
percent
of
the
skeletons
there
displayed
signs
of
violent
death
since
the
rise
of

some
years
ago
military
activity
has
occurred
over
much
of
the
globe
the
advent
of
gunpowder
and
the
acceleration
of
technological
advances
led
to
modern

according
to
conway
w
henderson
one
source
h
g

argued
that
writing
has
the
ability
to
put

laws
commandments
on

it
made
the

the

the
major
writing
systems—methods
of
inscription—broadly
fall
into
five
categories:
logographic
syllabic
alphabetic
featural
and
ideographic
symbols
for
ideas
a
sixth
category
pictographic
is
insufficient
to
represent
language
on
its
own
but
often
forms
the
core
of
logographies
a
logogram
is
a
written
character
which
represents
a
word
or
morpheme
a
vast
number
of
logograms
are
needed
to
write
chinese
characters
cuneiform
and
mayan
where
a
glyph
may
stand
for
a
morpheme
a
syllable
or
both—logoconsonantal
in
the
case
of
hieroglyphs
many
logograms
have
an
ideographic
component
chinese
radicals
hieroglyphic
determiners
for
example
in
mayan
the
glyph
for
fin
pronounced
ka
was
also
used
to
represent
the
syllable
ka
whenever
the
pronunciation
of
a
logogram
needed
to
be
indicated
or
when
there
was
no
logogram
in
chinese
about
of
characters
are
compounds
of
a
semantic
meaning
element
called
a
radical
with
an
existing
character
to
indicate
the
pronunciation
called
a
phonetic
however
such
phonetic
elements
complement
the
logographic
elements
rather
than
vice
versa
the
main
logographic
system
in
use
today
is
chinese
characters
used
with
some
modification
for
the
various
languages
or
dialects
of
china
japan
and
sometimes
in
korean
despite
the
fact
that
in
south
and
north
korea
the
phonetic
hangul
system
is
mainly
used
a
syllabary
is
a
set
of
written
symbols
that
represent
or
approximate
syllables
a
glyph
in
a
syllabary
typically
represents
a
consonant
followed
by
a
vowel
or
just
a
vowel
alone
though
in
some
scripts
more
complex
syllables
such
as
consonant-vowel-consonant
or
consonant-consonant-vowel
may
have
dedicated
glyphs
phonetically
related
syllables
are
not
so
indicated
in
the
script
for
instance
the
syllable
ka
may
look
nothing
like
the
syllable
ki
nor
will
syllables
with
the
same
vowels
be
similar
syllabaries
are
best
suited
to
languages
with
a
relatively
simple
syllable
structure
such
as
japanese
other
languages
that
use
syllabic
writing
include
the
linear
b
script
for
mycenaean
greek
cherokee
ndjuka
an
english-based
creole
language
of
surinam
and
the
vai
script
of
liberia
most
logographic
systems
have
a
strong
syllabic
component
ethiopic
though
technically
an
abugida
has
fused
consonants
and
vowels
together
to
the
point
where
it
is
learned
as
if
it
were
a
syllabary
an
alphabet
is
a
set
of
symbols
each
of
which
represents
or
historically
represented
a
phoneme
of
the
language
in
a
perfectly
phonological
alphabet
the
phonemes
and
letters
would
correspond
perfectly
in
two
directions:
a
writer
could
predict
the
spelling
of
a
word
given
its
pronunciation
and
a
speaker
could
predict
the
pronunciation
of
a
word
given
its
spelling
as
languages
often
evolve
independently
of
their
writing
systems
and
writing
systems
have
been
borrowed
for
languages
they
were
not
designed
for
the
degree
to
which
letters
of
an
alphabet
correspond
to
phonemes
of
a
language
varies
greatly
from
one
language
to
another
and
even
within
a
single
language
in
most
of
the
writing
systems
of
the
middle
east
it
is
usually
only
the
consonants
of
a
word
that
are
written
although
vowels
may
be
indicated
by
the
addition
of
various
diacritical
marks
writing
systems
based
primarily
on
marking
the
consonant
phonemes
alone
date
back
to
the
hieroglyphs
of
ancient
egypt
such
systems
are
called
abjads
derived
from
the
arabic
word
for
alphabet
in
most
of
the
alphabets
of
india
and
southeast
asia
vowels
are
indicated
through
diacritics
or
modification
of
the
shape
of
the
consonant
these
are
called
abugidas
some
abugidas
such
as
ethiopic
and
cree
are
learned
by
children
as
syllabaries
and
so
are
often
called
syllabics
however
unlike
true
syllabaries
there
is
not
an
independent
glyph
for
each
syllable
sometimes
the
term
alphabet
is
restricted
to
systems
with
separate
letters
for
consonants
and
vowels
such
as
the
latin
alphabet
although
abugidas
and
abjads
may
also
be
accepted
as
alphabets
because
of
this
use
greek
is
often
considered
to
be
the
first
alphabet
a
featural
script
notates
the
building
blocks
of
the
phonemes
that
make
up
a
language
for
instance
all
sounds
pronounced
with
the
lips
labial
sounds
may
have
some
element
in
common
in
the
latin
alphabet
this
is
accidentally
the
case
with
the
letters
b
and
p
however
labial
m
is
completely
dissimilar
and
the
similar-looking
q
and
d
are
not
labial
in
korean
hangul
however
all
four
labial
consonants
are
based
on
the
same
basic
element
but
in
practice
korean
is
learned
by
children
as
an
ordinary
alphabet
and
the
featural
elements
tend
to
pass
unnoticed
another
featural
script
is
signwriting
the
most
popular
writing
system
for
many
sign
languages
where
the
shapes
and
movements
of
the
hands
and
face
are
represented
iconically
featural
scripts
are
also
common
in
fictional
or
invented
systems
such
as
j
r
r
tolkien's
tengwar
historians
draw
a
sharp
distinction
between
prehistory
and
history
with
history
defined
by
the
advent
of
writing
the
cave
paintings
and
petroglyphs
of
prehistoric
peoples
can
be
considered
precursors
of
writing
but
they
are
not
considered
true
writing
because
they
did
not
represent
language
directly
writing
systems
develop
and
change
based
on
the
needs
of
the
people
who
use
them
sometimes
the
shape
orientation
and
meaning
of
individual
signs
changes
over
time
by
tracing
the
development
of
a
script
it
is
possible
to
learn
about
the
needs
of
the
people
who
used
the
script
as
well
as
how
the
script
changed
over
time
the
many
tools
and
writing
materials
used
throughout
history
include
stone

khipu
for
keeping
records
the
typewriter
and
various
forms
of
word
processors
have
subsequently
become
widespread
writing
tools
and
various
studies
have
compared
the
ways
in
which
writers
have
framed
the
experience
of
writing
with
such
tools
as
compared
with
the
pen
or

definition
the
modern
practice
of

are
recent
discoveries
of
the
earliest
known
neolithic
writings
while
neolithic
writing
is
a
current
research
topic
conventional
history
assumes
that
the
writing
process
first
evolved
from
economic
necessity
in
the
ancient
near
east
writing
most
likely
began
as
a
consequence
of
political
expansion
in
ancient
cultures
which
needed
reliable
means
for
transmitting
information
maintaining
financial
accounts
keeping
historical
records
and
similar
activities
around
the
th
millennium
bc
the
complexity
of
trade
and
administration
outgrew
the
power
of
memory
and
writing
became
a
more
dependable
method
of
recording
and
presenting
transactions
in
a
permanent
form
archaeologist
denise
schmandt-besserat
determined
the
link
between
previously
uncategorized
clay
tokens
the
oldest
of
which
have
been
found
in
the
zagros
region
of
iran
and
the
first
known
writing
mesopotamian
cuneiform
in
approximately
bc
the
mesopotamians
began
using
clay
tokens
to
count
their
agricultural
and
manufactured
goods
later
they
began
placing
these
tokens
inside
large
hollow
clay
containers
bulla
or
globular
envelopes
which
were
then
sealed
the
quantity
of
tokens
in
each
container
came
to
be
expressed
by
impressing
on
the
container's
surface
one
picture
for
each
instance
of
the
token
inside
they
next
dispensed
with
the
tokens
relying
solely
on
symbols
for
the
tokens
drawn
on
clay
surfaces
to
avoid
making
a
picture
for
each
instance
of
the
same
object
for
example:
pictures
of
a
hat
to
represent
hats
they
'counted'
the
objects
by
using
various
small
marks
in
this
way
the
sumerians
added
a
system
for
enumerating
objects
to
their
incipient
system
of
symbols
the
original
mesopotamian
writing
system
believed
to
be
the
world's
oldest
was
derived
around
bc
from
this
method
of
keeping
accounts
by
the
end
of
the
th
millennium
bc
the
mesopotamians
were
using
a
triangular-shaped
stylus
pressed
into
soft
clay
to
record
numbers
this
system
was
gradually
augmented
with
using
a
sharp
stylus
to
indicate
what
was
being
counted
by
means
of
pictographs
round-stylus
and
sharp-stylus
writing
was
gradually
replaced
by
writing
using
a
wedge-shaped
stylus
hence
the
term
cuneiform
at
first
only
for
logograms
but
by
the
th
century
bc
also
for
phonetic
elements
around
bc
cuneiform
began
to
represent
syllables
of
spoken
sumerian
about
that
time
mesopotamian
cuneiform
became
a
general
purpose
writing
system
for
logograms
syllables
and
numbers
this
script
was
adapted
to
another
mesopotamian
language
the
east
semitic
akkadian
assyrian
and
babylonian
around
bc
and
then
to
others
such
as
elamite
hattian
hurrian
and
hittite
scripts
similar
in
appearance
to
this
writing
system
include
those
for
ugaritic
and
old
persian
with
the
adoption
of
aramaic
as
the
'lingua
franca'
of
the
neo-assyrian
empire
–
bc
old
aramaic
was
also
adapted
to
mesopotamian
cuneiform
the
last
cuneiform

from
the
st

bc
clay
tablets
with
proto-elamite
writing
have
been
found
at
different
sites
across

the
proto-elamite
script
is

to
have
developed
from
early
cuneiform
proto-cuneiform
the
proto-elamite

used
for
a
very
brief
period
during
the
last
quarter
of
the
rd
millennium
bc
it
is
often
claimed
that
linear
elamite
is
a
syllabic
writing
system
derived
from
proto-elamite
although
this
cannot

generally
both
of
the
terms
astronomy

astrophysics
may
be
used
to
refer
to
the

subject
based
on
strict
dictionary
definitions
astronomy
refers
to
the
study
of
objects
and
matter
outside
the
earth's
atmosphere
and
of
their
physical
and
chemical
properties
while
astrophysics
refers
to
the
branch
of
astronomy
dealing
with
the
behavior
physical
properties
and
dynamic
processes
of
celestial
objects
and
phenomena
in
some
cases
as
in

astronomy
may
be
used
to
describe
the
qualitative
study
of
the
subject
whereas
astrophysics
is
used
to
describe
the
physics-oriented
version
of
the
subject
however
since
most
modern
astronomical
research
deals
with
subjects
related
to
physics
modern
astronomy
could
actually
be
called
astrophysics
some
fields
such
as
astrometry
are
purely
astronomy
rather
than
also
astrophysics
various

in

may
use
astronomy
and
astrophysics
partly
depending
on
whether
the

is
historically
affiliated
with
a

department
and
many
professional

early
ideas
about
the
motions
of
the
planets
were
formed
and
the
nature
of
the
sun
moon
and
the
earth
in
the
universe
were
explored
philosophically
the
earth
was
believed
to
be
the
center
of
the
universe
with
the
sun
the
moon
and
the
stars
rotating
around
it
this
is
known
as
the
geocentric
model
of
the
universe
or
the
ptolemaic
system
named
after
ptolemy
a
particularly
important
early
development
was
the
beginning
of
mathematical
and
scientific
astronomy
which
began
among
the
babylonians
who
laid
the
foundations
for
the
later
astronomical
traditions
that
developed
in
many
other
civilizations
the
babylonians
discovered
that
lunar
eclipses
recurred
in
a
repeating
cycle
known
as
a
saros
following
the
babylonians
significant
advances
in
astronomy
were
made
in
ancient
greece
and
the
hellenistic
world
greek
astronomy
is
characterized
from
the
start
by
seeking
a
rational
physical
explanation
for
celestial
phenomena
in
the
rd
century
bc
aristarchus
of
samos
estimated
the
size
and
distance
of
the
moon
and
sun
and
he
proposed
a
model
of
the
solar
system
where
the
earth
and
planets
rotated
around
the
sun
now
called
the
heliocentric
model
in
the
nd
century
bc
hipparchus
discovered
precession
calculated
the
size
and
distance
of
the
moon
and
invented
the
earliest
known
astronomical
devices
such
as
the
astrolabe
hipparchus
also
created
a
comprehensive
catalog
of
stars
and
most
of
the
constellations
of
the
northern
hemisphere
derive
from
greek
astronomy
the
antikythera
mechanism
c
–
bc
was
an
early
analog
computer
designed
to
calculate
the
location
of
the
sun
moon
and
planets
for
a
given
date
technological
artifacts
of
similar
complexity
did
not
reappear
until
the
th
century
when
mechanical
astronomical
clocks
appeared
in
europe
during
the
middle
ages
astronomy
was
mostly
stagnant
in
medieval
europe
at
least
until
the
th
century
however
astronomy
flourished
in
the
islamic
world
and
other
parts
of
the
world
this
led
to
the
emergence
of
the
first
astronomical
observatories
in
the
muslim
world
by
the
early
th
century
in
the
andromeda
galaxy
the
largest
galaxy
in
the
local
group
was
described
by
the
persian
astronomer
azophi
in
his
book
of
fixed
stars
the
sn
supernova
the
brightest
apparent
magnitude
stellar
event
in
recorded
history
was
observed
by
the
egyptian
arabic
astronomer
ali
ibn
ridwan
and
chinese
astronomers
in
some
of
the
prominent
islamic
mostly
persian
and
arab
astronomers
who
made
significant
contributions
to
the
science
include
al-battani
thebit
azophi
albumasar
biruni
arzachel
al-birjandi
and
the
astronomers
of
the
maragheh
and
samarkand
observatories
astronomers
during
that
time
introduced
many
arabic
names
now
used
for
individual
stars
it
is
also
believed
that
the
ruins
at
great
zimbabwe
and
timbuktu
may
have
housed
astronomical
observatories
europeans
had
previously
believed
that
there
had
been
no
astronomical
observation
in
sub-saharan
africa
during
the
pre-colonial
middle
ages
but
modern
discoveries
show
otherwise
for
over
six
centuries
from
the
recovery
of
ancient
learning
during
the
late
middle
ages
into
the
enlightenment
the
roman
catholic
church
gave
more
financial
and
social
support
to
the
study
of
astronomy
than
probably
all
other
institutions
among
the
church's
motives
was
finding
the
date
for
easter
during
the
renaissance
nicolaus
copernicus
proposed
a
heliocentric
model
of
the
solar
system
his
work
was
defended
by
galileo
galilei
and
expanded
upon
by
johannes
kepler
kepler
was
the
first
to
devise
a
system
that
correctly
described
the
details
of
the
motion
of
the
planets
around
the
sun
however
kepler
did
not
succeed
in
formulating
a
theory
behind
the
laws
he
wrote
down
it
was
isaac
newton
with
his
invention
of
celestial
dynamics
and
his
law
of
gravitation
who
finally
explained
the
motions
of
the
planets
newton
also
developed
the
reflecting
telescope
improvements
in
the
size
and
quality
of
the
telescope
led
to
further
discoveries
the
english
astronomer
john
flamsteed
catalogued
over
stars
more
extensive
star
catalogues
were
produced
by
nicolas
louis
de
lacaille
the
astronomer
william
herschel
made
a
detailed
catalog
of
nebulosity
and
clusters
and
in
discovered
the
planet
uranus
the
first
new
planet
found
the
distance
to
a
star
was
announced
in
when
the
parallax
of
cygni
was
measured
by
friedrich
bessel
during
the
–th
centuries
the
study
of
the
three-body
problem
by
leonhard
euler
alexis
claude
clairaut
and
jean
le
rond
d'alembert
led
to
more
accurate
predictions
about
the
motions
of
the
moon
and
planets
this
work
was
further
refined
by
joseph
louis
lagrange
and
pierre
simon
laplace
allowing
the
masses
of
the
planets
and
moons
to
be
estimated
from
their
perturbations
significant
advances
in
astronomy
came
about
with
the
introduction
of
new
technology
including
the
spectroscope
and
photography
joseph
von
fraunhofer
discovered
about
bands
in
the
spectrum
of
the
sun
in
–
which
in
gustav
kirchhoff
ascribed
to
the
presence
of
different
elements
stars
were
proven
to
be
similar
to
the
earth's
own
sun
but
with
a
wide
range
of
temperatures
masses
and
sizes
the
existence
of
the
earth's
galaxy
the
milky
way
as
its
own
group
of
stars
was
only
proved
in
the
th
century
along
with
the
existence
of
external
galaxies
the
observed
recession
of
those
galaxies
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
expansion
of
the
universe
theoretical
astronomy
led
to
speculations
on
the
existence
of
objects
such
as
black
holes
and
neutron
stars
which
have
been
used
to
explain
such
observed
phenomena
as
quasars
pulsars
blazars
and
radio
galaxies
physical
cosmology
made
huge
advances
during
the
th
century
in
the
early
the
model
of
the
big
bang
theory
was
formulated
heavily
evidenced
by
cosmic
microwave
background
radiation
hubble's
law
and
the
cosmological
abundances
of
elements
space
telescopes
have
enabled
measurements
in
parts
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
normally
blocked
or
blurred
by
the
atmosphere
in
february
it
was
revealed
that
the
ligo
project
had
detected
evidence
of
gravitational

in
the

september
our
main
source
of
information
about
celestial
bodies
and
other
objects
is
visible
light
or
more
generally
electromagnetic
radiation
observational
astronomy
may
be
categorized
according
to
the
corresponding
region
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
on
which
the
observations
are
made
some
parts
of
the
spectrum
can
be
observed
from
the
earth's
surface
while
other
parts
are
only
observable
from
either
high
altitudes
or
outside
the
earth's
atmosphere
specific
information
on
these
subfields
is
given
below
radio
astronomy
uses
radiation
with
wavelengths
greater
than
approximately
one
millimeter
outside
the
visible
range
radio
astronomy
is
different
from
most
other
forms
of
observational
astronomy
in
that
the
observed
radio
waves
can
be
treated
as
waves
rather
than
as
discrete
photons
hence
it
is
relatively
easier
to
measure
both
the
amplitude
and
phase
of
radio
waves
whereas
this
is
not
as
easily
done
at
shorter
wavelengths
although
some
radio
waves
are
emitted
directly
by
astronomical
objects
a
product
of
thermal
emission
most
of
the
radio
emission
that
is
observed
is
the
result
of
synchrotron
radiation
which
is
produced
when
electrons
orbit
magnetic
fields
additionally
a
number
of
spectral
lines
produced
by
interstellar
gas
notably
the
hydrogen
spectral
line
at
cm
are
observable
at
radio
wavelengths
a
wide
variety
of
other
objects
are
observable
at
radio
wavelengths
including
supernovae
interstellar
gas
pulsars
and
active
galactic
nuclei
infrared
astronomy
is
founded
on
the
detection
and
analysis
of
infrared
radiation
wavelengths
longer
than
red
light
and
outside
the
range
of
our
vision
the
infrared
spectrum
is
useful
for
studying
objects
that
are
too
cold
to
radiate
visible
light
such
as
planets
circumstellar
disks
or
nebulae
whose
light
is
blocked
by
dust
the
longer
wavelengths
of
infrared
can
penetrate
clouds
of
dust
that
block
visible
light
allowing
the
observation
of
young
stars
embedded
in
molecular
clouds
and
the
cores
of
galaxies
observations
from
the
wide-field
infrared
survey
explorer
wise
have
been
particularly
effective
at
unveiling
numerous
galactic
protostars
and
their
host
star
clusters
with
the
exception
of
infrared
wavelengths
close
to
visible
light
such
radiation
is
heavily
absorbed
by
the
atmosphere
or
masked
as
the
atmosphere
itself
produces
significant
infrared
emission
consequently
infrared
observatories
have
to
be
located
in
high
dry
places
on
earth
or
in
space
some
molecules
radiate
strongly
in
the
infrared
this
allows
the
study
of
the
chemistry
of
space
more
specifically
it
can
detect
water
in
comets
historically
optical
astronomy
also
called
visible
light
astronomy
is
the
oldest
form
of
astronomy
images
of
observations
were
originally
drawn
by
hand
in
the
late
th
century
and
most
of
the
th
century
images
were
made
using
photographic
equipment
modern
images
are
made
using
digital
detectors
particularly
using
charge-coupled
devices
ccds
and
recorded
on
modern
medium
although
visible
light
itself
extends
from
approximately
å
to
å
nm
to
nm
that
same
equipment
can
be
used
to
observe
some
near-ultraviolet
and
near-infrared
radiation
ultraviolet
astronomy
employs
ultraviolet
wavelengths
between
approximately
and
å
to
nm
light
at
those
wavelengths
is
absorbed
by
the
earth's
atmosphere
requiring
observations
at
these
wavelengths
to
be
performed
from
the
upper
atmosphere
or
from
space
ultraviolet
astronomy
is
best
suited
to
the
study
of
thermal
radiation
and
spectral
emission
lines
from
hot
blue
stars
ob
stars
that
are
very
bright
in
this

this
includes
the
blue
stars
in
other
galaxies
which
have
been
the
targets
of
several
ultraviolet

the
origin
of
the
word
galaxy
derives
from
the
greek
term
for
the
milky
way
galaxias
γαλαξίας
milky
one
or
kyklos
galaktikos
milky
circle
due
to
its
appearance
as
a
milky
band
of
light
in
the
sky
in
greek
mythology
zeus
places
his
son
born
by
a
mortal
woman
the
infant
heracles
on
hera's
breast
while
she
is
asleep
so
that
the
baby
will
drink
her
divine
milk
and
will
thus
become
immortal
hera
wakes
up
while
breastfeeding
and
then
realizes
she
is
nursing
an
unknown
baby:
she
pushes
the
baby
away
some
of
her
milk
spills
and
it
produces
the
faint
band
of
light
known
as
the
milky
way
in
the
astronomical
literature
the
capitalized
word
galaxy
is
often
used
to
refer
to
our
galaxy
the
milky
way
to
distinguish
it
from
the
other
galaxies
in
our
universe
the
english
term
milky
way
can
be
traced
back
to
a
story
by
chaucer
c
:
see
yonder
lo
the
galaxyë
which
men
clepeth
the
milky
wey
for
hit
is
whyt
galaxies
were
initially
discovered
telescopically
and
were
known
as
spiral
nebulae
most
th
to
th
century
astronomers
considered
them
as
either
unresolved
star
clusters
or
anagalactic
nebulae
and
were
just
thought
as
a
part
of
the
milky
way
but
their
true
composition
and
natures
remained
a
mystery
observations
using
larger
telescopes
of
a
few
nearby
bright
galaxies
like
the
andromeda
galaxy
began
resolving
them
into
huge
conglomerations
of
stars
but
based
simply
on
the
apparent
faintness
and
sheer
population
of
stars
the
true
distances
of
these
objects
placed
them
well
beyond
the
milky
way
for
this
reason
they
were
popularly
called
island
universes
but
this
term
quickly
fell
into
disuse
as
the
word
universe
implied
the
entirety
of
existence
instead
they
became
known
simply
as
galaxies
tens
of
thousands
of
galaxies
have
been
catalogued
but
only
a
few
have
well-established
names
such
as
the
andromeda
galaxy
the
magellanic
clouds
the
whirlpool
galaxy
and
the
sombrero
galaxy
astronomers
work
with
numbers
from
certain
catalogues
such
as
the
messier
catalogue
the
ngc
new
general
catalogue
the
ic

catalogue
the
cgcg
catalogue
of

and
of

of

the
mcg
morphological
catalogue
of

and
ugc
uppsala
general

of

all
of
the
well-known
galaxies
appear
in
one
or
more
of
these
catalogues
but
each
time
under
a
different
number
for

the
realization
that
we
live
in
a
galaxy
which
is
one
among
many
galaxies
parallels
major
discoveries
that
were
made
about
the
milky
way
and
other
nebulae
the
greek
philosopher
democritus
–
bce
proposed
that
the
bright
band
on
the
night
sky
known
as
the
milky
way
might
consist
of
distant
stars
aristotle
–
bce
however
believed
the
milky
way
to
be
caused
by
the
ignition
of
the
fiery
exhalation
of
some
stars
that
were
large
numerous
and
close
together
and
that
the
ignition
takes
place
in
the
upper
part
of
the
atmosphere
in
the
region
of
the
world
that
is
continuous
with
the
heavenly
motions
the
neoplatonist
philosopher
olympiodorus
the
younger
c
–
ce
was
critical
of
this
view
arguing
that
if
the
milky
way
is
sublunary
situated
between
earth
and
the
moon
it
should
appear
different
at
different
times
and
places
on
earth
and
that
it
should
have
parallax
which
it
does
not
in
his
view
the
milky
way
is
celestial
according
to
mohani
mohamed
the
arabian
astronomer
alhazen
–
made
the
first
attempt
at
observing
and
measuring
the
milky
way's
parallax
and
he
thus
determined
that
because
the
milky
way
had
no
parallax
it
must
be
remote
from
the
earth
not
belonging
to
the
atmosphere
the
persian
astronomer
al-bīrūnī
–
proposed
the
milky
way
galaxy
to
be
a
collection
of
countless
fragments
of
the
nature
of
nebulous
stars
the
andalusian
astronomer
ibn
bâjjah
avempace
d
proposed
that
the
milky
way
is
made
up
of
many
stars
that
almost
touch
one
another
and
appear
to
be
a
continuous
image
due
to
the
effect
of
refraction
from
sublunary
material
citing
his
observation
of
the
conjunction
of
jupiter
and
mars
as
evidence
of
this
occurring
when
two
objects
are
near
in
the
th
century
the
syrian-born
ibn
qayyim
proposed
the
milky
way
galaxy
to
be
a
myriad
of
tiny
stars
packed
together
in
the
sphere
of
the
fixed
stars
actual
proof
of
the
milky
way
consisting
of
the
usual
english
proper
name
for
earth's
natural
satellite
is
the
moon
which
in
nonscientific
texts
is
usually
not
capitalized
the
noun
moon
is
derived
from
old
english
mōna
which
like
all
germanic
language
cognates
stems
from
proto-germanic
mēnô
which
comes
from
proto-indo-european
mḗh₁n̥s
moon
month
which
comes
from
the
proto-indo-european
root
meh₁-
to
measure
the
month
being
the
ancient
unit
of
time
measured
by
the
moon
occasionally
the
name
luna
is
used
in
literature
especially
science
fiction
luna
is
used
to
distinguish
it
from
other
moons
while
in
poetry
the
name
has
been
used
to
denote
personification
of
our
moon
the
modern
english
adjective
pertaining
to
the
moon
is
lunar
derived
from
the
latin
word
for
the
moon
luna
the
adjective
selenic
usually
only
used
to
refer
to
the
chemical
element
selenium
is
so
rarely
used
to
refer
to
the
moon
that
this
meaning
is
not
recorded
in
most
major
dictionaries
it
is
derived
from
the
ancient
greek
word
for
the
moon
σελήνη
selḗnē
from
which
is
however
also
derived
the
prefix
seleno-
as
in
selenography
the
study
of
the
physical
features
of
the
moon
as
well
as
the
element
name
selenium
both
the
greek
goddess
selene
and
the
roman
goddess
diana
were
alternatively
called
cynthia
the
names
luna
cynthia
and
selene
are
reflected
in
terminology
for
lunar
orbits
in
words
such
as
apolune
pericynthion
and
selenocentric
the
name
diana
comes
from
the
proto-indo-european
diw-yo
heavenly
which
comes
from
the
pie
root
dyeu-
to
shine
which
in
many
derivatives
means
sky
heaven
and
god
and
is
also
the
origin
of
latin
dies
day
the
moon
formed
billion
years
ago
some
million
years
after
the
origin
of
the
solar
system
several
forming
mechanisms
have
been
proposed
including
the
fission
of
the
moon
from
earth's
crust
through
centrifugal
force
which
would
require
too
great
an
initial
spin
of
earth
the
gravitational
capture
of
a
pre-formed
moon
which
would
require
an
unfeasibly
extended
atmosphere
of
earth
to
dissipate
the
energy
of
the
passing
moon
and
the
co-formation
of
earth
and
the
moon
together
in
the
primordial
accretion
disk
which
does
not
explain
the
depletion
of
metals
in
the
moon
these
hypotheses
also
cannot
account
for
the
high
angular
momentum
of
the
earth–moon
system
the
prevailing
hypothesis
is
that
the
earth–moon
system
formed
after
an
impact
of
a
mars-sized
body
named
theia
with
the
proto-earth
giant
impact
the
impact
blasted
material
into
earth's
orbit
and
then
the
material
accreted
and
formed
the
moon
the
moon's
far
side
has
a
crust
that
is
mi
km
thicker
than
that
of
the
near
side
this
is
thought
to
be
because
the
moon
fused
from
two
different
bodies
this
hypothesis
although
not
perfect
perhaps
best
explains
the
evidence
eighteen
months
prior
to
an
october
conference
on
lunar
origins
bill
hartmann
roger
phillips
and
jeff
taylor
challenged
fellow
lunar
scientists:
you
have
eighteen
months
go
back
to
your
apollo
data
go
back
to
your
computer
do
whatever
you
have
to
but
make
up
your
mind
don't
come
to
our
conference
unless
you
have
something
to
say
about
the
moon's
birth
at
the
conference
at
kona
hawaii
the
giant
impact
hypothesis
emerged
as
the
most
popular
before
the
conference
there
were
partisans
of
the
three
traditional
theories
plus
a
few
people
who
were
starting
to
take
the
giant
impact
seriously
and
there
was
a
huge
apathetic
middle
who
didn’t
think
the
debate
would
ever
be
resolved
afterward
there
were
essentially
only
two
groups:
the
giant
impact
camp
and
the
agnostics
giant
impacts
are
thought
to
have
been
common
in
the
early
solar
system
computer
simulations
of
giant
impacts
have
produced
results
that
are
consistent
with
the
mass
of
the
lunar
core
and
the
angular
momentum
of
the
earth–moon
system
these
simulations
also
show
that
most
of
the
moon
derived
from
the
impactor
rather
than
the
proto-earth
however
more
recent
simulations
suggest
a
larger
fraction
of
the
moon
derived
from
the
proto-earth
other
bodies
of
the
inner
solar
system
such
as
mars
and
vesta
have
according
to
meteorites
from
them
very
different
oxygen
and
tungsten
isotopic
compositions
compared
to
earth
however
earth
and
the
moon
have
nearly
identical
isotopic
compositions
the
isotopic
equalization
of
the
earth-moon
system
might
be
explained
by
the
post-impact
mixing
of
the
vaporized
material
that
formed
the
two
although
this
is
debated
the
impact
released
a
lot
of
energy
and
then
the
released
material
re-accreted
into
the
earth–moon
system
this
would
have
melted
the
outer
shell
of
earth
and
thus
formed
a
magma
ocean
similarly
the
newly
formed
moon
would
also
have
been
affected
and
had
its
own
lunar
magma
ocean
its
depth
is
estimated
from
about
km
miles
to
km
miles
while
the
giant
impact
hypothesis
might
explain
many
lines
of
evidence
some
questions
are
still
unresolved
most
of
which
involve
the
moon's
composition
in
a
team
at
the
carnegie
institute
of
washington
reported
the
most
precise
measurement
of
the
isotopic
signatures
of
lunar
rocks
to
their
surprise
the
rocks
from
the
apollo
program
had
the
same
isotopic
signature
as
rocks
from
earth
however
they
differed
from
almost
all
other
bodies
in
the
solar
system
indeed
this
observation
was
unexpected
because
most
of
the
material
that
formed
the
moon
was
thought
to
come
from
theia
and
it
was
announced
in
that
there
was
less
than
a
chance
that
theia
and
earth
had
identical
isotopic
signatures
other
apollo
lunar
samples
had
in
the
same
titanium
isotopes
composition
as
earth
which
conflicts
with
what
is
the
idea
of
planets
has
evolved
over
its
history
from
the
divine
lights
of
antiquity
to
the
earthly
objects
of
the
scientific
age
the
concept
has
expanded
to
include
worlds
not
only
in
the
solar
system
but
in
hundreds
of
other
extrasolar
systems
the
ambiguities
inherent
in
defining
planets
have
led
to
much
scientific
controversy
the
five
classical
planets
being
visible
to
the
naked
eye
have
been
known
since
ancient
times
and
have
had
a
significant
impact
on
mythology
religious
cosmology
and
ancient
astronomy
in
ancient
times
astronomers
noted
how
certain
lights
moved
across
the
sky
as
opposed
to
the
fixed
stars
which
maintained
a
constant
relative
position
in
the
sky
ancient
greeks
called
these
lights
πλάνητες
ἀστέρες
planētes
asteres
wandering
stars
or
simply
πλανῆται
planētai
wanderers
from
which
today's
word
planet
was
derived
in
ancient
greece
china
babylon
and
indeed
all
pre-modern
civilizations
it
was
almost
universally
believed
that
earth
was
the
center
of
the
universe
and
that
all
the
planets
circled
earth
the
reasons
for
this
perception
were
that
stars
and
planets
appeared
to
revolve
around
earth
each
day
and
the
apparently
common-sense
perceptions
that
earth
was
solid
and
stable
and
that
it
was
not
moving
but
at
rest
the
first
civilization
known
to
have
a
functional
theory
of
the
planets
were
the
babylonians
who
lived
in
mesopotamia
in
the
first
and
second
millennia
bc
the
oldest
surviving
planetary
astronomical
text
is
the
babylonian
venus
tablet
of
ammisaduqa

the
term
biology
is
derived
from
the
greek
word
βίος
bios
life
and
the
suffix
-λογία
-logia
study
of
the
latin-language
form
of
the
term
first
appeared
in
when
swedish
scientist
carl
linnaeus
carl
von
linné
used
biologi
in
his

it
was
used

dna
is
a
long
polymer
made
from
repeating
units
called
nucleotides
the
structure
of
dna
is
dynamic
along
its
length
being
capable
of
coiling
into
tight
loops
and
other
shapes
in
all
species
it
is
composed
of
two
helical
chains
bound
to
each
other
by
hydrogen
bonds
both
chains
are
coiled
around
the
same
axis
and
have
the
same
pitch
of
ångströms
nanometres
the
pair
of
chains
has
a
radius
of
ångströms
nanometre
according
to
another
study
when
measured
in
a
different
solution
the
dna
chain
measured
to
ångströms
wide
to
nanometres
and
one
nucleotide
unit
measured
å
nm
long
although
each
individual
nucleotide
repeating
unit
is
very
small
dna
polymers
can
be
very
large
molecules
containing
hundreds
of
millions
of
nucleotides
for
instance
the
dna
in
the
largest
human
chromosome
chromosome
number
consists
of
approximately
million
base
pairs
and
would
be
mm
long
if
straightened
in
living
organisms
dna
does
not
usually
exist
as
a
single
strand
but
instead
as
a
pair
of
strands
that
are
held
tightly
together
these
two
long
strands
entwine
like
vines
in
the
shape
of
a
double
helix
the
nucleotide
contains
both
a
segment
of
the
backbone
of
the
molecule
which
holds
the
chain
together
and
a
nucleobase
which
interacts
with
the
other
dna
strand
in
the
helix
a
nucleobase
linked
to
a
sugar
is
called
a
nucleoside
and
a
base
linked
to
a
sugar
and
one
or
more
phosphate
groups
is
called
a
nucleotide
a
polymer
comprising
multiple
linked
nucleotides
as
in
dna
is
called
a
polynucleotide
the
backbone
of
the
dna
strand
is
made
from
alternating
phosphate
and
sugar
residues
the
sugar
in
dna
is
-deoxyribose
which
is
a
pentose
five-carbon
sugar
the
sugars
are
joined
together
by
phosphate
groups
that
form
phosphodiester
bonds
between
the
third
and
fifth
carbon
atoms
of
adjacent
sugar
rings
which
are
known
as
the
′
and
′
carbons
the
prime
symbol
being
used
to
distinguish
these
carbon
atoms
from
those
of
the
base
to
which
the
deoxyribose
forms
a
glycosidic
bond
when
imagining
dna
each
phosphoryl
is
normally
considered
to
belong
to
the
nucleotide
whose
′
carbon
forms
a
bond
therewith
any
dna
strand
therefore
normally
has
one
end
at
which
there
is
a
phosphoryl
attached
to
the
′
carbon
of
a
ribose
the
′
phosphoryl
and
another
end
at
which
there
is
a
free
hydroxyl
attached
to
the
′
carbon
of
a
ribose
the
′
hydroxyl
the
orientation
of
the
′
and
′
carbons
along
the
sugar-phosphate
backbone
confers
directionality
sometimes
called
polarity
to
each
dna
strand
in
a
double
helix
the
direction
of
the
nucleotides
in
one
strand
is
opposite
to
their
direction
in
the
other
strand:
the
strands
are
antiparallel
the
asymmetric
ends
of
dna
strands
are
said
to
have
a
directionality
of
five
prime
′
and
three
prime
′
with
the
′
end
having
a
terminal
phosphate
group
and
the
′
end
a
terminal
hydroxyl
group
one
major
difference
between
dna
and
rna
is
the
sugar
with
the
-deoxyribose
in
dna
being
replaced
by
the
alternative
pentose
sugar
ribose
in
rna
the
dna
double
helix
is
stabilized
primarily
by
two
forces:
hydrogen
bonds
between
nucleotides
and
base-stacking
interactions
among
aromatic
nucleobases
in
the
aqueous
environment
of
the
cell
the
conjugated
π
bonds
of
nucleotide
bases
align
perpendicular
to
the
axis
of
the
dna
molecule
minimizing
their
interaction
with
the
solvation
shell
the
four
bases
found
in
dna
are
adenine
a
cytosine
c
guanine
g
and
thymine
t
these
four
bases
are
attached
to
the
sugar-phosphate
to
form
the
complete
nucleotide
as
shown
for
adenosine
monophosphate
adenine
pairs
with
thymine
and
guanine
pairs
with
cytosine
forming
a-t
and
g-c
base
pairs
the
nucleobases
are
classified
into
two
types:
the
purines
a
and
g
which
are
fused
five-
and
six-membered
heterocyclic
compounds
and
the
pyrimidines
the
six-membered
rings
c
and
t
a
fifth
pyrimidine
nucleobase
uracil
usually
takes
the
place
of
thymine
in
rna
and
differs
from
thymine
by
lacking
a
methyl
group
on
its
ring
in
addition
to
rna
and
dna
many
artificial
nucleic
acid
analogues
have
been
created
to
study
the
properties
of
nucleic
acids
or
for
use
in
biotechnology
uracil
is
not
usually
found
in
dna
occurring
only
as
a
breakdown
product
of
cytosine

in
several
bacteriophages
such
as

the
reason
for
the
presence
of
these
non
canonical
bases
in

is
not
known
it
seems
likely
that
at
least
part
of
the
reason
for
their
presence
in
bacterial
viruses
phages
is
to
avoid
the
restriction
enzymes
present
in

this
enzyme
system
acts
at
least
in
part
as
a
molecular
immune
system
protecting
bacteria
from
infection
by

this
does
not
appear
to
be
the
entire
story
four
modifications
to

in
the
centromeric
regions
of
at

two
human
chromosomes
and
seventeen
non
canonical
bases
are
known
to
occur
in
dna
most
of
the
structures
that
make
up
the
proposal
that
one
type
of
organism
could
descend
from
another
type
goes
back
to
some
of
the
first
pre-socratic
greek
philosophers
such
as
anaximander
and
empedocles
such
proposals
survived
into
roman
times
the
poet
and
philosopher
lucretius
followed
empedocles
in
his
masterwork
de
rerum
natura
on
the
nature
of
things
in
contrast
to
these
materialistic
views
aristotelianism
considered
all
natural
things
as
actualisations
of
fixed
natural
possibilities
known
as
forms
this
was
part
of
a
medieval
teleological
understanding
of
nature
in
which
all
things
have
an
intended
role
to
play
in
a
divine
cosmic
order
variations
of
this
idea
became
the
standard
understanding
of
the
middle
ages
and
were
integrated
into
christian
learning
but
aristotle
did
not
demand
that
real
types
of
organisms
always
correspond
one-for-one
with
exact
metaphysical
forms
and
specifically
gave
examples
of
how
new
types
of
living
things
could
come
to
be
in
the
th
century
the
new
method
of
modern
science
rejected
the
aristotelian
approach
it
sought
explanations
of
natural
phenomena
in
terms
of
physical
laws
that
were
the
same
for
all
visible
things
and
that
did
not
require
the
existence
of
any
fixed
natural
categories
or
divine
cosmic
order
however
this
new
approach
was
slow
to
take
root
in
the
biological
sciences
the
last
bastion
of
the
concept
of
fixed
natural
types
john
ray
applied
one
of
the
previously
more
general
terms
for
fixed
natural
types
species
to
plant
and
animal
types
but
he
strictly
identified
each
type
of
living
thing
as
a
species
and
proposed
that
each
species
could
be
defined
by
the
features
that
perpetuated
themselves
generation
after
generation
the
biological
classification
introduced
by
carl
linnaeus
in
explicitly
recognised
the
hierarchical
nature
of
species
relationships
but
still
viewed
species
as
fixed
according
to
a
divine
plan
other
naturalists
of
this
time
speculated
on
the
evolutionary
change
of
species
over
time
according
to
natural
laws
in
pierre
louis
maupertuis
wrote
of
natural
modifications
occurring
during
reproduction
and
accumulating
over
many
generations
to
produce
new
species
georges-louis
leclerc
comte
de
buffon
suggested
that
species
could
degenerate
into
different
organisms
and
erasmus
darwin
proposed
that
all
warm-blooded
animals
could
have
descended
from
a
single
microorganism
or
filament
the
first
full-fledged
evolutionary
scheme
was
jean-baptiste
lamarck's
transmutation
theory
of
which
envisaged
spontaneous
generation
continually
producing
simple
forms
of
life
that
developed
greater
complexity
in
parallel
lineages
with
an
inherent
progressive
tendency
and
postulated
that
on
a
local
level
these
lineages
adapted
to
the
environment
by
inheriting
changes
caused
by
their
use
or
disuse
in
parents
the
latter
process
was
later
called
lamarckism
these
ideas
were
condemned
by
established
naturalists
as
speculation
lacking
empirical
support
in
particular
georges
cuvier
insisted
that
species
were
unrelated
and
fixed
their
similarities
reflecting
divine
design
for
functional
needs
in
the
meantime
ray's
ideas
of
benevolent
design
had
been
developed
by
william
paley
into
the
natural
theology
or
evidences
of
the
existence
and
attributes
of
the
deity
which
proposed
complex
adaptations
as
evidence
of
divine
design
and
which
was
admired
by
charles
darwin
the
crucial
break
from
the
concept
of
constant
typological
classes
or
types
in
biology
came
with
the
theory
of
evolution
through
natural
selection
which
was
formulated
by
charles
darwin
in
terms
of
variable
populations
partly
influenced
by
an
essay
on
the
principle
of
population
by
thomas
robert
malthus
darwin
noted
that
population
growth
would
lead
to
a
struggle
for
existence
in
which
favourable
variations
prevailed
as
others
perished
in
each
generation
many
offspring
fail
to
survive
to
an
age
of
reproduction
because
of
limited
resources
this
could
explain
the
diversity
of
plants
and
animals
from
a
common
ancestry
through
the
working
of
natural
laws
in
the
same
way
for
all
types
of
organism
darwin
developed
his
theory
of
natural
selection
from
onwards
and
was
writing
up
his
big
book
on
the
subject
when
alfred
russel
wallace
sent
him
a
version
of
virtually
the
same
theory
in
their
separate
papers
were
presented
together
at
an
meeting
of
the
linnean
society
of
london
at
the
end
of
darwin's
publication
of
his
abstract
as
on
the
origin
of
species
explained
natural
selection
in
detail
and
in
a
way
that
led
to
an
increasingly
wide
acceptance
of
darwin's
concepts
of
evolution
at
the
expense
of
alternative
theories
thomas
henry
huxley
applied
darwin's
ideas
to
humans
using
paleontology
and
comparative
anatomy
to
provide
strong
evidence
that
humans
and
apes
shared
a
common
ancestry
some
were
disturbed
by
this
since
it
implied
that
humans
did
not
have
a
special
place
in
the
universe
the
mechanisms
of
reproductive
heritability
and
the
origin
of
new
traits
remained
a
mystery
towards
this
end
darwin
developed
his
provisional
theory
of
pangenesis
in
gregor
mendel
reported
that
traits
were
inherited
in
a
predictable
manner
through
the
independent
assortment
and
segregation
of
elements
later
known
as
genes
mendel's
laws
of
inheritance
eventually
supplanted
most
of
darwin's
pangenesis
theory
august
weismann
made
the
important
distinction
between
germ
cells
that
give
rise
to
gametes
such
as
sperm
and
egg
cells
and
the
somatic
cells
of
the
body
demonstrating
that
heredity
passes
through
the
germ
line
only
hugo
de
vries
connected
darwin's
pangenesis
theory
to
weismann's
germ/soma
cell
distinction
and
proposed
that
darwin's
pangenes
were
concentrated
in
the
cell
nucleus
and
when
expressed
they
could
move
into
the
cytoplasm
to
change
the
cell's
structure
de
vries
was
also
one
of
the
researchers
who
made
mendel's
work
well
known
believing
that
mendelian
traits
corresponded
to
the
transfer
of
heritable
variations
along
the
germline
to
explain
how
new
variants
originate
de
vries
developed
a
mutation
theory
that
led
to
a
temporary
rift
between
those
who
accepted
darwinian
evolution
and
biometricians
who
allied
with
de
vries
in
the
pioneers
in
the
field
of
population
genetics
such
as
ronald
fisher
sewall
wright
and
j
b
haldane
set
the
foundations
of
evolution
onto
a
robust
statistical
philosophy
the
false
contradiction
between
darwin's
theory
genetic
mutations
and
mendelian
inheritance
was
thus
reconciled
in
the
and
the
so-called
modern
synthesis
connected
natural
selection
and
population
genetics
based
on
mendelian
inheritance
into
a
unified
theory
that
applied
generally
to
any
branch
of
biology
the
modern
synthesis
explained
patterns
observed
across
species
in
populations
through
fossil
transitions
in
palaeontology
and
complex
cellular
mechanisms
in
developmental
biology
the
publication
of
the
structure
of
dna
by
james
watson
and
francis
crick
with
contribution
of
rosalind
franklin
in
demonstrated
a
physical
mechanism
for
inheritance
molecular
biology
improved
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
genotype
and
phenotype
advancements
were
also
made
in
phylogenetic
systematics
mapping
the
transition
of
traits
into
a
comparative
and
testable
framework
through
the
publication
and
use
of
evolutionary
trees
in
evolutionary
biologist
theodosius
dobzhansky
penned
that
nothing
in
biology
makes
sense
except
in
the
light
of
evolution
because
it
has
brought
to
light
the
relations
of
what
first
seemed
disjointed
facts
in
natural
history
into
a
coherent
explanatory
body
of
knowledge
that
describes
and
predicts
many
observable
facts
about
life
on
this
planet
since
then
the
modern
synthesis
has
been
further
extended
to
explain
biological
phenomena
across
the
full
and
integrative
scale
of
the
biological
hierarchy
from
genes
to
species
one
extension
known
as
evolutionary
developmental
biology
and
informally
called
evo-devo
emphasises
how
changes
between
generations
evolution
acts
on
patterns
of
change
within
individual
organisms
development
since
the
beginning
of
the
st
century
and
in
light
of
discoveries
made
in
recent
decades
some
biologists
have
argued
for
an
extended
evolutionary
synthesis
which
would
account
for
the
effects
of
non-genetic
inheritance
modes
such
as
epigenetics
parental
effects
ecological
inheritance
and
cultural
inheritance
and
evolvability
evolution
in
organisms
occurs
through
changes
in
heritable
traits—the
inherited
characteristics
of
an
organism
in
humans
for
example
eye
colour
is
an
inherited
characteristic
and
an
individual
might
inherit
the
brown-eye
trait
from
one
of
their
parents
inherited
traits
are
controlled
by
genes
and
the
complete
set
of
genes
within
an
organism's
genome
genetic
material
is
called
its
genotype
the
complete
set
of
observable
traits
that
make
up
the
structure
and
behaviour
of
an
organism
is
called
its
phenotype
these
traits
come
from
the
interaction
of
its
genotype
with
the
environment
as
a
result
many
aspects
of
an
organism's
phenotype
are
not
inherited
for
example
suntanned
skin
comes
from
the
interaction
between
a
person's
genotype
and
sunlight
thus
suntans
are
not
passed
on
to
people's
children
however
some
people
tan
more
easily
than
others
due
to
differences
in
genotypic
variation
a
striking
example
are
people
with
the
inherited
trait
of
albinism
who
do
not
tan
at
all
and
are
very
sensitive
to
sunburn
heritable
traits
are
passed
from
one
generation
to
the
next
via
dna
a
molecule
that
encodes
genetic
information
dna
is
a
long
biopolymer
composed
of
four
types
of
bases
the
sequence
of
bases
along
a
particular
dna
molecule
specify
the
genetic
information
in
a
manner
similar
to
a
sequence
of
letters
spelling
out
a
sentence
before
a
cell
divides
the
dna
is
copied
so
that
each
of
the
resulting
two
cells
will
inherit
the
dna
sequence
portions
of
a
dna
molecule
that
specify
a
single
functional
unit
are
called
genes
different
genes
have
different
sequences
of
bases
within
cells
the
long
strands
of
dna
form
condensed
structures
called
chromosomes
the
specific
location
of
a
dna
sequence
within
a
chromosome
is
known
as
a
locus
if
the
dna
sequence
at
a
locus
varies
between
individuals
the
different
forms
of
this
sequence
are
called
alleles
dna
sequences
can
change
through
mutations
producing
new
alleles
if
a
mutation
occurs
within
a
gene
the
new
allele
may
affect
the
trait
that
the
gene
controls
altering
the
phenotype
of
the
organism
however
while
this
simple
correspondence
between
an
allele
and
a
trait
works
in
some
cases
most
traits
are
more
complex
and
are
controlled
by
quantitative
trait
loci
multiple
interacting
genes
recent
findings
have
confirmed
important
examples
of
heritable
changes
that
cannot
be
explained
by
changes
to
the
sequence
of
nucleotides
in
the
dna
these
phenomena
are
classed
as
epigenetic
inheritance
systems
dna
methylation
marking
chromatin
self-sustaining
metabolic
loops
gene
silencing
by
rna
interference
and
the
three-dimensional
conformation
of
proteins
such
as
prions
are
areas
where
epigenetic
inheritance
systems
have
been
discovered
at
the
organismic
level
developmental
biologists
suggest
that
complex
interactions
in
genetic
networks
and
communication
among
cells
can
lead
to
heritable
variations
that
may
underlay
some
of
the
mechanics
in
developmental
plasticity
and
canalisation
heritability
may
also
occur
at
even
larger
scales
for
example
ecological
inheritance
through
the
process
of
niche
construction
is
defined
by
the
regular
and
repeated
activities
of
organisms
in
their
environment
this
generates
a
legacy
of
effects
that
modify
and
feed
back
into
the
selection
regime
of
subsequent
generations
descendants
inherit
genes
plus
environmental
characteristics
generated
by
the
ecological
actions
of
ancestors
other
examples
of
heritability
in
evolution
that
are
not
under
the
direct
control
of
genes
include
the
inheritance
of
cultural
traits
and
symbiogenesis
an
individual
organism's
phenotype
results
from
both
its
genotype
and
the
influence
from
the
environment
it
has
lived
in
a
substantial
part
of
the
phenotypic
variation
in
a
population
is
caused
by
genotypic
variation
the
modern
evolutionary
synthesis
defines
evolution
as
the
change
over
time
in
this
genetic
variation
the
frequency
of
one
particular
allele
will
become
more
or
less
prevalent
relative
to
other
forms
of
that
gene
variation
disappears
when
a
new
allele
reaches
the
point
of
fixation—when
it
either
disappears
from
the
population
or
replaces
the
ancestral
allele
entirely
natural
selection
will
only
cause
evolution
if
there
is
enough
genetic
variation
in
a
population
before
the
discovery
of
mendelian
genetics
one
common
hypothesis
was
blending
inheritance
but
with
blending
inheritance
genetic
variance
would
be
rapidly
lost
making
evolution
by
natural
selection
implausible
the
hardy–weinberg
principle
provides
the
solution
to
how
variation
is
maintained
in
a
population
with
mendelian
inheritance
the
frequencies
of
alleles
variations
in
a
gene
will
remain
constant
in
the
absence
of
selection
mutation
migration
and
genetic
drift
variation
comes
from
mutations
in
the
genome
reshuffling
of
genes
through
sexual
reproduction
and
migration
between
populations
gene
flow
despite
the
constant
introduction
of
new
variation
through
mutation
and
gene
flow
most
of
the
genome
of
a
species
is
identical
in
all
individuals
of
that
species
however
even
relatively
small
differences
in
genotype
can
lead
to
dramatic
differences
in
phenotype:
for
example
chimpanzees
and
humans
differ
in
only
about
of
their
genomes
mutations
are
changes
in
the
dna
sequence
of
a
cell's
genome
when
mutations
occur
they
may
alter
the
product
of
a
gene
or
prevent
the
gene
from
functioning
or
have
no
effect
based
on
studies
in
the
fly
drosophila
melanogaster
it
has
been
suggested
that
if
a
mutation
changes
a
protein
produced
by
a
gene
this
will
probably
be
harmful
with
about
of
these
mutations
having
damaging
effects
and
the
remainder
being
either
neutral
or
weakly
beneficial
mutations
can
involve
large
sections
of
a
chromosome
becoming
duplicated
usually
by
genetic
recombination
which
can
introduce
extra
copies
of
a
gene
into
a
genome
extra
copies
of
genes
are
a
major
source
of
the
raw
material
needed
for
new
genes
to
evolve
this
is
important
because
most
new
genes
evolve
within
gene
families
from
pre-existing
genes
that
share
common
ancestors
for
example
the
human
eye
uses
four
genes
to
make
structures
that
sense
light:
three
for
colour
vision
and
one
for
night
vision
all
four
are
descended
from
a
single
ancestral
gene
new
genes
can
be
generated
from
an
ancestral
gene
when
a
duplicate
copy
mutates
and
acquires
a
new
function
this
process
is
easier
once
a
gene
has
been
duplicated
because
it
increases
the
redundancy
of
the
system
one
gene
in
the
pair
can
acquire
a
new
function
while
the
other
copy
continues
to
perform
its
original
function
other
types
of
mutations
can
even
generate
entirely
new
genes
from
previously
noncoding
dna
the
generation
of
new
genes
can
also
involve
small
parts
of
several
genes
being
duplicated
with
these
fragments
then
recombining
to
form
new
combinations
with
new
functions
when
new
genes
are
assembled
from
shuffling
pre-existing
parts
domains
act
as
modules
with
simple
independent
functions
which
can
be
mixed
together
to
produce
new
combinations
with
new
and
complex
functions
for
example
polyketide
synthases
are
large
enzymes
that
make
antibiotics
they
contain
up
to
one
hundred
independent
domains
that
each
catalyse
one
step
in
the
overall
process
like
a
step
in
an
assembly
line
in
asexual
organisms
genes
are
inherited
together
or
linked
as
they
cannot
mix
with
genes
of
other
organisms
during
reproduction
in
contrast
the
offspring
of
sexual
organisms
contain
random
mixtures
of
their
parents'
chromosomes
that
are
produced
through
independent
assortment
in
a
related
process
called
homologous
recombination
sexual
organisms
exchange
dna
between
two
matching
chromosomes
recombination
and
reassortment
do
not
alter
allele
frequencies
but
instead
change
which
alleles
are
associated
with
each
other
producing
offspring
with
new
combinations
of
alleles
sex
usually
increases
genetic
variation
and
may
increase
the
rate
of
evolution
the
two-fold
cost
of
sex
was
first
described
by
john
maynard
smith
the
first
cost
is
that
in
sexually
dimorphic
species
only
one
of
the
two
sexes
can
bear
young
this
cost
does
not
apply
to
hermaphroditic
species
like
most
plants
and
many
invertebrates
the
second
cost
is
that
any
individual
who
reproduces
sexually
can
only
pass
on
of
its
genes
to
any
individual
offspring
with
even
less
passed
on
as
each
new
generation
passes
yet
sexual
reproduction
is
the
more
common
means
of
reproduction
among
eukaryotes
and
multicellular
organisms
the
red
queen
hypothesis
has
been
used
to
explain
the
significance
of
sexual
reproduction
as
a
means
to
enable
continual
evolution
and
adaptation
in
response
to
coevolution
with
other
species
in
an
ever-changing
environment
gene
flow
is
the
exchange
of
genes
between
populations
and
between
species
it
can
therefore
be
a
source
of
variation
that
is
new
to
a
population
or
to
a
species
gene
flow
can
be
caused
by
the
movement
of
individuals
between
separate
populations
of
organisms
as
might
be
caused
by
the
movement
of
mice
between
inland
and
coastal
populations
or
the
movement
of
pollen
between
heavy-metal-tolerant
and
heavy-metal-sensitive
populations
of
grasses
gene
transfer
between
species
includes
the
formation
of
hybrid
organisms
and
horizontal
gene
transfer
horizontal
gene
transfer
is
the
transfer
of
genetic
material
from
one
organism
to
another
organism
that
is
not
its
offspring
this
is
most
common
among
bacteria
in
medicine
this
contributes
to
the
spread
of
antibiotic
resistance
as
when
one
bacteria
acquires
resistance
genes
it
can
rapidly
transfer
them
to
other
species
horizontal
transfer
of
genes
from
bacteria
to
eukaryotes
such
as
the
yeast
saccharomyces
cerevisiae
and
the
adzuki
bean
weevil
callosobruchus
chinensis
has
occurred
an
example
of
larger-scale
transfers
are
the
eukaryotic
bdelloid
rotifers
which
have
received
a
range
of
genes
from
bacteria
fungi
and
plants
viruses
can
also
carry
dna
between
organisms
allowing
transfer
of
genes
even
across
biological
domains
large-scale
gene
transfer
has
also
occurred
between
the
ancestors
of
eukaryotic
cells
and
bacteria
during
the
acquisition
of
chloroplasts
and
mitochondria
it
is
possible
that
eukaryotes
themselves
originated
from
horizontal
gene
transfers
between
bacteria
and
archaea
from
a
neo-darwinian
perspective
evolution
occurs
when
there
are
changes
in
the
frequencies
of
alleles
within
a
population
of
interbreeding
organisms
for
example
the
allele
for
black
colour
in
a
population
of
moths
becoming
more
common
mechanisms
that
can
lead
to
changes
in
allele
frequencies
include
natural
selection
genetic
drift
genetic
hitchhiking
mutation
and
gene
flow
evolution
by
means
of
natural
selection
is
the
process
by
which
traits
that
enhance
survival
and
reproduction
become
more
common
in
successive
generations
of
a
population
it
has
often
been
called
a
self-evident
mechanism
because
it
necessarily
follows
from
three
simple
facts:
variation
exists
within
populations
of
organisms
with
respect
to
morphology
physiology
and
behaviour
phenotypic
variation
different
traits
confer
different
rates
of
survival
and
reproduction
differential
fitness
these
traits
can
be
passed
from
generation
to
generation
heritability
of
fitness
more
offspring
are
produced
than
can
possibly
survive
and
these
conditions
produce
competition
between
organisms
for
survival
and
reproduction
consequently
organisms
with
traits
that
give
them
an
advantage
over
their
competitors
are
more
likely
to
pass
on
their
traits
to
the
next
generation
than
those
with
traits
that
do
not
confer
an
advantage
this
teleonomy
is
the
quality
whereby
the
process
of
natural
selection
creates
and
preserves
traits
that
are
seemingly
fitted
for
the
functional
roles
they
perform
consequences
of
selection
include
nonrandom
mating
and
genetic
hitchhiking
the
central
concept
of
natural
selection
is
the
evolutionary
fitness
of
an
organism
fitness
is
measured
by
an
organism's
ability
to
survive
and
reproduce
which
determines
the
size
of
its
genetic
contribution
to
the
next
generation
however
fitness
is
not
the
same
as
the
total
number
of
offspring:
instead
fitness
is
indicated
by
the
proportion
of
subsequent
generations
that
carry
an
organism's
genes
for
example
if
an
organism
could
survive
well
and
reproduce
rapidly
but
its
offspring
were
all
too
small
and
weak
to
survive
this
organism
would
make
little
genetic
contribution
to
future
generations
and
would
thus
have
low
fitness
if
an
allele
increases
fitness
more
than
the
other
alleles
of
that
gene
then
with
each
generation
this
allele
will
become
more
common
within
the
population
these
traits
are
said
to
be
selected
for
examples
of
traits
that
can
increase
fitness
are
enhanced
survival
and
increased
fecundity
conversely
the
lower
fitness
caused
by
having
a
less
beneficial
or
deleterious
allele
results
in
this
allele
becoming
rarer—they
are
selected
against
importantly
the
fitness
of
an
allele
is
not
a
fixed
characteristic
if
the
environment
changes
previously
neutral
or
harmful
traits
may
become
beneficial
and
previously
beneficial
traits
become
harmful
however
even
if
the
direction
of
selection
does
reverse
in
this
way
traits
that
were
lost
in
the
past
may
not
re-evolve
in
an
identical
form
see
dollo's
law
however
a
re-activation
of
dormant
genes
as
long
as
they
have
not
been
eliminated
from
the
genome
and
were
only
suppressed
perhaps
for
hundreds
of
generations
can
lead
to
the
re-occurrence
of
traits
thought
to
be
lost
like
hindlegs
in
dolphins
teeth
in
chickens
wings
in
wingless
stick
insects
tails
and
additional
nipples
in
humans
etc
throwbacks
such
as
these
are
known
as
atavisms
natural
selection
within
a
population
for
a
trait
that
can
vary
across
a
range
of
values
such
as
height
can
be
categorised
into
three
different
types
the
first
is
directional
selection
which
is
a
shift
in
the
average
value
of
a
trait
over
time—for
example
organisms
slowly
getting
taller
secondly
disruptive
selection
is
selection
for
extreme
trait
values
and
often
results
in
two
different
values
becoming
most
common
with
selection
against
the
average
value
this
would
be
when
either
short
or
tall
organisms
had
an
advantage
but
not
those
of
medium
height
finally
in
stabilising
selection
there
is
selection
against
extreme
trait
values
on
both
ends
which
causes
a
decrease
in
variance
around
the
average
value
and
less
diversity
this
would
for
example
cause
organisms
to
eventually
have
a
similar
height
a
special
case
of
natural
selection
is
sexual
selection
which
is
selection
for
any
trait
that
increases
mating
success
by
increasing
the
attractiveness
of
an
organism
to
potential
mates
traits
that
evolved
through
sexual
selection
are
particularly
prominent
among
males
of
several
animal
species
although
sexually
favoured
traits
such
as
cumbersome
antlers
mating
calls
large
body
size
and
bright
colours
often
attract
predation
which
compromises
the
survival
of
individual
males
this
survival
disadvantage
is
balanced
by
higher
reproductive
success
in
males
that
show
these
hard-to-fake
sexually
selected
traits
natural
selection
most
generally
makes
nature
the
measure
against
which
individuals
and
individual
traits
are
more
or
less
likely
to
survive
nature
in
this
sense
refers
to
an
ecosystem
that
is
a
system
in
which
organisms
interact
with
every
other
element
physical
as
well
as
biological
in
their
local
environment
eugene
odum
a
founder
of
ecology
defined
an
ecosystem
as:
any
unit
that
includes
all
of
the
organisms
in
a
given
area
interacting
with
the
physical
environment
so
that
a
flow
of
energy
leads
to
clearly
defined
trophic
structure
biotic
diversity
and
material
cycles
i
e
exchange
of
materials
between
living
and
nonliving
parts
within
the
system
each
population
within
an
ecosystem
occupies
a
distinct
niche
or
position
with
distinct
relationships
to
other
parts
of
the
system
these
relationships
involve
the
life
history
of
the
organism
its
position
in
the
food
chain
and
its
geographic
range
this
broad
understanding
of
nature
enables
scientists
to
delineate
specific
forces
which
together
comprise
natural
selection
natural
selection
can
act
at
different
levels
of
organisation
such
as
genes
cells
individual
organisms
groups
of
organisms
and
species
selection
can
act
at
multiple
levels
simultaneously
an
example
of
selection
occurring
below
the
level
of
the
individual
organism
are
genes
called
transposons
which
can
replicate
and
spread
throughout
a
genome
selection
at
a
level
above
the
individual
such
as
group
selection
may
allow
the
evolution
of
cooperation
as
discussed
below
in
addition
to
being
a
major
source
of
variation
mutation
may
also
function
as
a
mechanism
of
evolution
when
there
are
different
probabilities
at
the
molecular
level
for
different
mutations
to
occur
a
process
known
as
mutation
bias
if
two
genotypes
for
example
one
with
the
nucleotide
g
and
another
with
the
nucleotide
a
in
the
same
position
have
the
same
fitness
but
mutation
from
g
to
a
happens
more
often
than
mutation
from
a
to
g
then
genotypes
with
a
will
tend
to
evolve
different
insertion
vs
deletion
mutation
biases
in
different
taxa
can
lead
to
the
evolution
of
different
genome
sizes
developmental
or
mutational
biases
have
also
been
observed
in
morphological
evolution
for
example
according
to
the
phenotype-first
theory
of
evolution
mutations
can
eventually
cause
the
genetic
assimilation
of
traits
that
were
previously
induced
by
the
environment
mutation
bias
effects
are
superimposed
on
other
processes
if
selection
would
favour
either
one
out
of
two
mutations
but
there
is
no
extra
advantage
to
having
both
then
the
mutation
that
occurs
the
most
frequently
is
the
one
that
is
most
likely
to
become
fixed
in
a
population
mutations
leading
to
the
loss
of
function
of
a
gene
are
much
more
common
than
mutations
that
produce
a
new
fully
functional
gene
most
loss
of
function
mutations
are
selected
against
but
when
selection
is
weak
mutation
bias
towards
loss
of
function
can
affect
evolution
for
example
pigments
are
no
longer
useful
when
animals
live
in
the
darkness
of
caves
and
tend
to
be
lost
this
kind
of
loss
of
function
can
occur
because
of
mutation
bias
and/or
because
the
function
had
a
cost
and
once
the
benefit
of
the
function
disappeared
natural
selection
leads
to
the
loss
loss
of
sporulation
ability
in
bacillus
subtilis
during
laboratory
evolution
appears
to
have
been
caused
by
mutation
bias
rather
than
natural
selection
against
the
cost
of
maintaining
sporulation
ability
when
there
is
no
selection
for
loss
of
function
the
speed
at
which
loss
evolves
depends
more
on
the
mutation
rate
than
it
does
on
the
effective
population
size
indicating
that
it
is
driven
more
by
mutation
bias
than
by
genetic
drift
in
parasitic
organisms
mutation
bias
leads
to
selection
pressures
as
seen
in
ehrlichia
mutations
are
biased
towards
antigenic
variants
in
outer-membrane
proteins
genetic
drift
is
the
random
fluctuations
of
allele
frequencies
within
a
population
from
one
generation
to
the
next
when
selective
forces
are
absent
or
relatively
weak
allele
frequencies
are
equally
likely
to
drift
upward
or
downward
at
each
successive
generation
because
the
alleles
are
subject
to
sampling
error
this
drift
halts
when
an
allele
eventually
becomes
fixed
either
by
disappearing
from
the
population
or
replacing
the
other
alleles
entirely
genetic
drift
may
therefore
eliminate
some
alleles
from
a
population
due
to
chance
alone
even
in
the
absence
of
selective
forces
genetic
drift
can
cause
two
separate
populations
that
began
with
the
same
genetic
structure
to
drift
apart
into
two
divergent
populations
with
different
sets
of
alleles
the
neutral
theory
of
molecular
evolution
proposed
that
most
evolutionary
changes
are
the
result
of
the
fixation
of
neutral
mutations
by
genetic
drift
hence
in
this
model
most
genetic
changes
in
a
population
are
the
result
of
constant
mutation
pressure
and
genetic
drift
this
form
of
the
neutral
theory
is
now
largely
abandoned
since
it
does
not
seem
to
fit
the
genetic
variation
seen
in
nature
however
a
more
recent
and
better-supported
version
of
this
model
is
the
nearly
neutral
theory
where
a
mutation
that
would
be
effectively
neutral
in
a
small
population
is
not
necessarily
neutral
in
a
large
population
other
alternative
theories
propose
that
genetic
drift
is
dwarfed
by
other
stochastic
forces
in
evolution
such
as
genetic
hitchhiking
also
known
as
genetic
draft
the
time
for
a
neutral
allele
to
become
fixed
by
genetic
drift
depends
on
population
size
with
fixation
occurring
more
rapidly
in
smaller
populations
the
number
of
individuals
in
a
population
is
not
critical
but
instead
a
measure
known
as
the
effective
population
size
the
effective
population
is
usually
smaller
than
the
total
population
since
it
takes
into
account
factors
such
as
the
level
of
inbreeding
and
the
stage
of
the
lifecycle
in
which
the
population
is
the
smallest
the
effective
population
size
may
not
be
the
same
for
every
gene
in
the
same
population
it
is
usually
difficult
to
measure
the
relative
importance
of
selection
and
neutral
processes
including
drift
the
comparative
importance
of
adaptive
and
non-adaptive
forces
in
driving
evolutionary
change
is
an
area
of
current
research
recombination
allows
alleles
on
the
same
strand
of
dna
to
become
separated
however
the
rate
of
recombination
is
low
approximately
two
events
per
chromosome
per
generation
as
a
result
genes
close
together
on
a
chromosome
may
not
always
be
shuffled
away
from
each
other
and
genes
that
are
close
together
tend
to
be
inherited
together
a
phenomenon
known
as
linkage
this
tendency
is
measured
by
finding
how
often
two
alleles
occur
together
on
a
single
chromosome
compared
to
expectations
which
is
called
their
linkage
disequilibrium
a
set
of
alleles
that
is
usually
inherited
in
a
group
is
called
a
haplotype
this
can
be
important
when
one
allele
in
a
particular
haplotype
is
strongly
beneficial:
natural
selection
can
drive
a
selective
sweep
that
will
also
cause
the
other
alleles
in
the
haplotype
to
become
more
common
in
the
population
this
effect
is
called
genetic
hitchhiking
or
genetic
draft
genetic
draft
caused
by
the
fact
that
some
neutral
genes
are
genetically
linked
to
others
that
are
under
selection
can
be
partially
captured
by
an
appropriate
effective
population
size
gene
flow
involves
the
exchange
of
genes
between
populations
and
between
species
the
presence
or
absence
of
gene
flow
fundamentally
changes
the
course
of
evolution
due
to
the
complexity
of
organisms
any
two
completely
isolated
populations
will
eventually
evolve
genetic
incompatibilities
through
neutral
processes
as
in
the
bateson-dobzhansky-muller
model
even
if
both
populations
remain
essentially
identical
in
terms
of
their
adaptation
to
the
environment
if
genetic
differentiation
between
populations
develops
gene
flow
between
populations
can
introduce
traits
or
alleles
which
are
disadvantageous
in
the
local
population
and
this
may
lead
to
organisms
within
these
populations
evolving
mechanisms
that
prevent
mating
with
genetically
distant
populations
eventually
resulting
in
the
appearance
of
new
species
thus
exchange
of
genetic
information
between
individuals
is
fundamentally
important
for
the
development
of
the
biological
species
concept
bsc
during
the
development
of
the
modern
synthesis
sewall
wright
developed
his
shifting
balance
theory
which
regarded
gene
flow
between
partially
isolated
populations
as
an
important
aspect
of
adaptive
evolution
however
recently
there
has
been
substantial
criticism
of
the
importance
of
the
shifting
balance
theory
evolution
influences
every
aspect
of
the
form
and
behaviour
of
organisms
most
prominent
are
the
specific
behavioural
and
physical
adaptations
that
are
the
outcome
of
natural
selection
these
adaptations
increase
fitness
by
aiding
activities
such
as
finding
food
avoiding
predators
or
attracting
mates
organisms
can
also
respond
to
selection
by
cooperating
with
each
other
usually
by
aiding
their
relatives
or
engaging
in
mutually
beneficial
symbiosis
in
the
longer
term
evolution
produces
new
species
through
splitting
ancestral
populations
of
organisms
into
new
groups
that
cannot
or
will
not
interbreed
these
outcomes
of
evolution
are
distinguished
based
on
time
scale
as
macroevolution
versus
microevolution
macroevolution
refers
to
evolution
that
occurs
at
or
above
the
level
of
species
in
particular
speciation
and
extinction
whereas
microevolution
refers
to
smaller
evolutionary
changes
within
a
species
or
population
in
particular
shifts
in
allele
frequency
and
adaptation
in
general
macroevolution
is
regarded
as
the
outcome
of
long
periods
of
microevolution
thus
the
distinction
between
micro-
and
macroevolution
is
not
a
fundamental
one—the
difference
is
simply
the
time
involved
however
in
macroevolution
the
traits
of
the
entire
species
may
be
important
for
instance
a
large
amount
of
variation
among
individuals
allows
a
species
to
rapidly
adapt
to
new
habitats
lessening
the
chance
of
it
going
extinct
while
a
wide
geographic
range
increases
the
chance
of
speciation
by
making
it
more
likely
that
part
of
the
population
will
become
isolated
in
this
sense
microevolution
and
macroevolution
might
involve
selection
at
different
levels—with
microevolution
acting
on
genes
and
organisms
versus
macroevolutionary
processes
such
as
species
selection
acting
on
entire
species
and
affecting
their
rates
of
speciation
and
extinction
a
common
misconception
is
that
evolution
has
goals
long-term
plans
or
an
innate
tendency
for
progress
as
expressed
in
beliefs
such
as
orthogenesis
and
evolutionism
realistically
however
evolution
has
no
long-term
goal
and
does
not
necessarily
produce
greater
complexity
although
complex
species
have
evolved
they
occur
as
a
side
effect
of
the
overall
number
of
organisms
increasing
and
simple
forms
of
life
still
remain
more
common
in
the
biosphere
for
example
the
overwhelming
majority
of
species
are
microscopic
prokaryotes
which
form
about
half
the
world's
biomass
despite
their
small
size
and
constitute
the
vast
majority
of
earth's
biodiversity
simple
organisms
have
therefore
been
the
dominant
form
of
life
on
earth
throughout
its
history
and
continue
to
be
the
main
form
of
life
up
to
the
present
day
with
complex
life
only
appearing
more
diverse
because
it
is
more
noticeable
indeed
the
evolution
of
microorganisms
is
particularly
important
to
modern
evolutionary
research
since
their
rapid
reproduction
allows
the
study
of
experimental
evolution
and
the
observation
of
evolution
and
adaptation
in
real
time
adaptation
is
the
process
that
makes
organisms
better
suited
to
their
habitat
also
the
term
adaptation
may
refer
to
a
trait
that
is
important
for
an
organism's
survival
for
example
the
adaptation
of
horses'
teeth
to
the
grinding
of
grass
by
using
the
term
adaptation
for
the
evolutionary
process
and
adaptive
trait
for
the
product
the
bodily
part
or
function
the
two
senses
of
the
word
may
be
distinguished
adaptations
are
produced
by
natural
selection
the
following
definitions
are
due
to
theodosius
dobzhansky:
adaptation
is
the
evolutionary
process
whereby
an
organism
becomes
better
able
to
live
in
its
habitat
or
habitats
adaptedness
is
the
state
of
being
adapted:
the
degree
to
which
an
organism
is
able
to
live
and
reproduce
in
a
given
set
of
habitats
an
adaptive
trait
is
an
aspect
of
the
developmental
pattern
of
the
organism
which
enables
or
enhances
the
probability
of
that
organism
surviving
and
reproducing
adaptation
may
cause
either
the
gain
of
a
new
feature
or
the
loss
of
an
ancestral
feature
an
example
that
shows
both
types
of
change
is
bacterial
adaptation
to
antibiotic
selection
with
genetic
changes
causing
antibiotic
resistance
by
both
modifying
the
target
of
the
drug
or
increasing
the
activity
of
transporters
that
pump
the
drug
out
of
the
cell
other
striking
examples
are
the
bacteria
escherichia
coli
evolving
the
ability
to
use
citric
acid
as
a
nutrient
in
a
long-term
laboratory
experiment
flavobacterium
evolving
a
novel
enzyme
that
allows
these
bacteria
to
grow
on
the
by-products
of
nylon
manufacturing
and
the
soil
bacterium
sphingobium
evolving
an
entirely
new
metabolic
pathway
that
degrades
the
synthetic
pesticide
pentachlorophenol
an
interesting
but
still
controversial
idea
is
that
some
adaptations
might
increase
the
ability
of
organisms
to
generate
genetic
diversity
and
adapt
by
natural
selection
increasing
organisms'
evolvability
adaptation
occurs
through
the
gradual
modification
of
existing
structures
consequently
structures
with
similar
internal
organisation
may
have
different
functions
in
related
organisms
this
is
the
result
of
a
single
ancestral
structure
being
adapted
to
function
in
different
ways
the
bones
within
bat
wings
for
example
are
very
similar
to
those
in
mice
feet
and
primate
hands
due
to
the
descent
of
all
these
structures
from
a
common
mammalian
ancestor
however
since
all
living
organisms
are
related
to
some
extent
even
organs
that
appear
to
have
little
or
no
structural
similarity
such
as
arthropod
squid
and
vertebrate
eyes
or
the
limbs
and
wings
of
arthropods
and
vertebrates
can
depend
on
a
common
set
of
homologous
genes
that
control
their
assembly
and
function
this
is
called
deep
homology
during
evolution
some
structures
may
lose
their
original
function
and
become
vestigial
structures
such
structures
may
have
little
or
no
function
in
a
current
species
yet
have
a
clear
function
in
ancestral
species
or
other
closely
related
species
examples
include
pseudogenes
the
non-functional
remains
of
eyes
in
blind
cave-dwelling
fish
wings
in
flightless
birds
the
presence
of
hip
bones
in
whales
and
snakes
and
sexual
traits
in
organisms
that
reproduce
via
asexual
reproduction
examples
of
vestigial
structures
in
humans
include
wisdom
teeth
the
coccyx
the
vermiform
appendix
and
other
behavioural
vestiges
such
as
goose
bumps
and
primitive
reflexes
however
many
traits
that
appear
to
be
simple
adaptations
are
in
fact
exaptations:
structures
originally
adapted
for
one
function
but
which
coincidentally
became
somewhat
useful
for
some
other
function
in
the
process
one
example
is
the
african
lizard
holaspis
guentheri
which
developed
an
extremely
flat
head
for
hiding
in
crevices
as
can
be
seen
by
looking
at
its
near
relatives
however
in
this
species
the
head
has
become
so
flattened
that
it
assists
in
gliding
from
tree
to
tree—an
exaptation
within
cells
molecular
machines
such
as
the
bacterial
flagella
and
protein
sorting
machinery
evolved
by
the
recruitment
of
several
pre-existing
proteins
that
previously
had
different
functions
another
example
is
the
recruitment
of
enzymes
from
glycolysis
and
xenobiotic
metabolism
to
serve
as
structural
proteins
called
crystallins
within
the
lenses
of
organisms'
eyes
an
area
of
current
investigation
in
evolutionary
developmental
biology
is
the
developmental
basis
of
adaptations
and
exaptations
this
research
addresses
the
origin
and
evolution
of
embryonic
development
and
how
modifications
of
development
and
developmental
processes
produce
novel
features
these
studies
have
shown
that
evolution
can
alter
development
to
produce
new
structures
such
as
embryonic
bone
structures
that
develop
into
the
jaw
in
other
animals
instead
forming
part
of
the
middle
ear
in
mammals
it
is
also
possible
for
structures
that
have
been
lost
in
evolution
to
reappear
due
to
changes
in
developmental
genes
such
as
a
mutation
in
chickens
causing
embryos
to
grow
teeth
similar
to
those
of
crocodiles
it
is
now
becoming
clear
that
most
alterations
in
the
form
of
organisms
are
due
to
changes
in
a
small
set
of
conserved
genes
interactions
between
organisms
can
produce
both
conflict
and
cooperation
when
the
interaction
is
between
pairs
of
species
such
as
a
pathogen
and
a
host
or
a
predator
and
its
prey
these
species
can
develop
matched
sets
of
adaptations
here
the
evolution
of
one
species
causes
adaptations
in
a
second
species
these
changes
in
the
second
species
then
in
turn
cause
new
adaptations
in
the
first
species
this
cycle
of
selection
and
response
is
called
coevolution
an
example
is
the
production
of
tetrodotoxin
in
the
rough-skinned
newt
and
the
evolution
of
tetrodotoxin
resistance
in
its
predator
the
common
garter
snake
in
this
predator-prey
pair
an
evolutionary
arms
race
has
produced
high
levels
of
toxin
in
the
newt
and
correspondingly
high
levels
of
toxin
resistance
in
the
snake
not
all
co-evolved
interactions
between
species
involve
conflict
many
cases
of
mutually
beneficial
interactions
have
evolved
for
instance
an
extreme
cooperation
exists
between
plants
and
the
mycorrhizal
fungi
that
grow
on
their
roots
and
aid
the
plant
in
absorbing
nutrients
from
the
soil
this
is
a
reciprocal
relationship
as
the
plants
provide
the
fungi
with
sugars
from
photosynthesis
here
the
fungi
actually
grow
inside
plant
cells
allowing
them
to
exchange
nutrients
with
their
hosts
while
sending
signals
that
suppress
the
plant
immune
system
coalitions
between
organisms
of
the
same
species
have
also
evolved
an
extreme
case
is
the
eusociality
found
in
social
insects
such
as
bees
termites
and
ants
where
sterile
insects
feed
and
guard
the
small
number
of
organisms
in
a
colony
that
are
able
to
reproduce
on
an
even
smaller
scale
the
somatic
cells
that
make
up
the
body
of
an
animal
limit
their
reproduction
so
they
can
maintain
a
stable
organism
which
then
supports
a
small
number
of
the
animal's
germ
cells
to
produce
offspring
here
somatic
cells
respond
to
specific
signals
that
instruct
them
whether
to
grow
remain
as
they
are
or
die
if
cells
ignore
these
signals
and
multiply
inappropriately
their
uncontrolled
growth
causes
cancer
such
cooperation
within
species
may
have
evolved
through
the
process
of
kin
selection
which
is
where
one
organism
acts
to
help
raise
a
relative's
offspring
this
activity
is
selected
for
because
if
the
helping
individual
contains
alleles
which
promote
the
helping
activity
it
is
likely
that
its
kin
will
also
contain
these
alleles
and
thus
those
alleles
will
be
passed
on
other
processes
that
may
promote
cooperation
include
group
selection
where
cooperation
provides
benefits
to
a
group
of
organisms
speciation
is
the
process
where
a
species
diverges
into
two
or
more
descendant
species
there
are
multiple
ways
to
define
the
concept
of
species
the
choice
of
definition
is
dependent
on
the
particularities
of
the
species
concerned
for
example
some
species
concepts
apply
more
readily
toward
sexually
reproducing
organisms
while
others
lend
themselves
better
toward
asexual
organisms
despite
the
diversity
of
various
species
concepts
these
various
concepts
can
be
placed
into
one
of
three
broad
philosophical
approaches:
interbreeding
ecological
and
phylogenetic
the
biological
species
concept
bsc
is
a
classic
example
of
the
interbreeding
approach
defined
by
evolutionary
biologist
ernst
mayr
in
the
bsc
states
that
species
are
groups
of
actually
or
potentially
interbreeding
natural
populations
which
are
reproductively
isolated
from
other
such
groups
despite
its
wide
and
long-term
use
the
bsc
like
others
is
not
without
controversy
for
example
because
these
concepts
cannot
be
applied
to
prokaryotes
and
this
is
called
the
species
problem
some
researchers
have
attempted
a
unifying
monistic
definition
of
species
while
others
adopt
a
pluralistic
approach
and
suggest
that
there
may
be
different
ways
to
logically
interpret
the
definition
of
a
species
barriers
to
reproduction
between
two
diverging
sexual
populations
are
required
for
the
populations
to
become
new
species
gene
flow
may
slow
this
process
by
spreading
the
new
genetic
variants
also
to
the
other
populations
depending
on
how
far
two
species
have
diverged
since
their
most
recent
common
ancestor
it
may
still
be
possible
for
them
to
produce
offspring
as
with
horses
and
donkeys
mating
to
produce
mules
such
hybrids
are
generally
infertile
in
this
case
closely
related
species
may
regularly
interbreed
but
hybrids
will
be
selected
against
and
the
species
will
remain
distinct
however
viable
hybrids
are
occasionally
formed
and
these
new
species
can
either
have
properties
intermediate
between
their
parent
species
or
possess
a
totally
new
phenotype
the
importance
of
hybridisation
in
producing
new
species
of
animals
is
unclear
although
cases
have
been
seen
in
many
types
of
animals
with
the
gray
tree
frog
being
a
particularly
well-studied
example
speciation
has
been
observed
multiple
times
under
both
controlled
laboratory
conditions
see
laboratory
experiments
of
speciation
and
in
nature
in
sexually
reproducing
organisms
speciation
results
from
reproductive
isolation
followed
by
genealogical
divergence
there
are
four
primary
geographic
modes
of
speciation
the
most
common
in
animals
is
allopatric
speciation
which
occurs
in
populations
initially
isolated
geographically
such
as
by
habitat
fragmentation
or
migration
selection
under
these
conditions
can
produce
very
rapid
changes
in
the
appearance
and
behaviour
of
organisms
as
selection
and
drift
act
independently
on
populations
isolated
from
the
rest
of
their
species
separation
may
eventually
produce
organisms
that
cannot
interbreed
the
second
mode
of
speciation
is
peripatric
speciation
which
occurs
when
small
populations
of
organisms
become
isolated
in
a
new
environment
this
differs
from
allopatric
speciation
in
that
the
isolated
populations
are
numerically
much
smaller
than
the
parental
population
here
the
founder
effect
causes
rapid
speciation
after
an
increase
in
inbreeding
increases
selection
on
homozygotes
leading
to
rapid
genetic
change
the
third
mode
is
parapatric
speciation
this
is
similar
to
peripatric
speciation
in
that
a
small
population
enters
a
new
habitat
but
differs
in
that
there
is
no
physical
separation
between
these
two
populations
instead
speciation
results
from
the
evolution
of
mechanisms
that
reduce
gene
flow
between
the
two
populations
generally
this
occurs
when
there
has
been
a
drastic
change
in
the
environment
within
the
parental
species'
habitat
one
example
is
the
grass
anthoxanthum
odoratum
which
can
undergo
parapatric
speciation
in
response
to
localised
metal
pollution
from
mines
here
plants
evolve
that
have
resistance
to
high
levels
of
metals
in
the
soil
selection
against
interbreeding
with
the
metal-sensitive
parental
population
produced
a
gradual
change
in
the
flowering
time
of
the
metal-resistant
plants
which
eventually
produced
complete
reproductive
isolation
selection
against
hybrids
between
the
two
populations
may
cause
reinforcement
which
is
the
evolution
of
traits
that
promote
mating
within
a
species
as
well
as
character
displacement
which
is
when
two
species
become
more
distinct
in
appearance
finally
in
sympatric
speciation
species
diverge
without
geographic
isolation
or
changes
in
habitat
this

anatomy
is
the
scientific
study
of
the
structure
of
organisms
including
their
systems
organs
and
tissues
it
includes
the
appearance
and
position
of
the
various
parts
the
materials
from
which
they
are
composed
their
locations
and
their
relationships
with

parts
anatomy
is
quite
distinct
from
physiology
cancers
are
a
large
family
of
diseases
that
involve
abnormal
cell
growth
with
the
potential
to
invade
or
spread
to
other
parts
of
the
body
they
form
a
subset
of
neoplasms
a
neoplasm
or
tumor
is
a
group
of
cells
that
have
undergone
unregulated
growth
and
will
often
form
a
mass
or
lump
but
may
be
distributed
diffusely
all
tumor
cells
show
the
six
hallmarks
of
cancer
these
characteristics
are
required
to
produce
a
malignant
tumor
they
include:
cell
growth
and
division
absent
the
proper
signals
continuous
growth
and
division
even
given
contrary
signals
avoidance
of
programmed
cell
death
limitless
number
of
cell
divisions
promoting
blood
vessel
construction
invasion
of
tissue
and
formation
of
metastasesthe
progression
from
normal
cells
to
cells
that
can
form
a
detectable
mass
to
outright
cancer
involves
multiple
steps
known
as
malignant
progression
when
cancer
begins
it
produces
no
symptoms
signs
and
symptoms
appear
as
the
mass
grows
or
ulcerates
the
findings
that
result
depend
on
the
cancer's
type
and
location
few
symptoms
are
specific
many
frequently
occur
in
individuals
who
have
other
conditions
cancer
is
a
great
imitator
thus
it
is
common
for
people
diagnosed
with
cancer
to
have
been
treated
for
other
diseases
which
were
hypothesized
to
be
causing
their
symptoms
people
may
become
anxious
or
depressed
post-diagnosis
the
risk
of
suicide
in
people
with
cancer
is
approximately
double
local
symptoms
may
occur
due
to
the
mass
of
the
tumor
or
its
ulceration
for
example
mass
effects
from
lung
cancer
can
block
the
bronchus
resulting
in
cough
or
pneumonia
esophageal
cancer
can
cause
narrowing
of
the
esophagus
making
it
difficult
or
painful
to
swallow
and
colorectal
cancer
may
lead
to
narrowing
or
blockages
in
the
bowel
affecting
bowel
habits
masses
in
breasts
or
testicles
may
produce
observable
lumps
ulceration
can
cause
bleeding
that
if
it
occurs
in
the
lung
will
lead
to
coughing
up
blood
in
the
bowels
to
anemia
or
rectal
bleeding
in
the
bladder
to
blood
in
the
urine
and
in
the
uterus
to
vaginal
bleeding
although
localized
pain
may
occur
in
advanced
cancer
the
initial
swelling
is
usually
painless
some
cancers
can
cause
a
buildup
of
fluid
within
the
chest
or
abdomen
general
symptoms
occur
due
to
effects
that
are
not
related
to
direct
or
metastatic
spread
these
may
include:
unintentional
weight
loss
fever
excessive
fatigue
and
changes
to
the
skin
hodgkin
disease
leukemias
and
cancers
of
the
liver
or
kidney
can
cause
a
persistent
fever
some
cancers
may
cause
specific
groups
of
systemic
symptoms
termed
paraneoplastic
syndrome
examples
include
the
appearance
of
myasthenia
gravis
in
thymoma
and
clubbing
in
lung
cancer
cancer
can
spread
from
its
original
site
by
local
spread
lymphatic
spread
to
regional
lymph
nodes
or
by
hematogenous
spread
via
the
blood
to
distant
sites
known
as
metastasis
when
cancer
spreads
by
a
hematogenous
route
it
usually
spreads
all
over
the
body
however
cancer
'seeds'
grow
in
certain
selected
site
only
'soil'
as
hypothesized
in
the
soil
and
seed
hypothesis
of
cancer
metastasis
the
symptoms
of
metastatic
cancers
depend
on
the
tumor
location
and
can
include
enlarged
lymph
nodes
which
can
be
felt
or
sometimes
seen
under
the
skin
and
are
typically
hard
enlarged
liver
or
enlarged
spleen
which
can
be
felt
in
the
abdomen
pain
or
fracture
of
affected
bones
and
neurological
symptoms
the
majority
of
cancers
some
–
of
cases
are
due
to
genetic
mutations
from
environmental
factors
the
remaining
–
are
due
to
inherited
genetics
environmental
as
used
by
cancer
researchers
means
any
cause
that
is
not
inherited
genetically
such
as
lifestyle
economic
and
behavioral
factors
and
not
merely
pollution
common
environmental
factors
that
contribute
to
cancer
death
include
tobacco
–
diet
and
obesity
–
infections
–
radiation
both
ionizing
and
non-ionizing
up
to
stress
lack
of
physical
activity
and
pollution
it
is
not
generally
possible
to
prove
what
caused
a
particular
cancer
because
the
various
causes
do
not
have
specific
fingerprints
for
example
if
a
person
who
uses
tobacco
heavily
develops
lung
cancer
then
it
was
probably
caused
by
the
tobacco
use
but
since
everyone
has
a
small
chance
of
developing
lung
cancer
as
a
result
of
air
pollution
or
radiation
the
cancer
may
have
developed
for
one
of
those
reasons
excepting
the
rare
transmissions
that
occur
with
pregnancies
and
occasional
organ
donors
cancer
is
generally
not
a
transmissible
disease
exposure
to
particular
substances
have
been
linked
to
specific
types
of
cancer
these
substances
are
called
carcinogens
tobacco
smoke
for
example
causes
of
lung
cancer
it
also
causes
cancer
in
the
larynx
head
neck
stomach
bladder
kidney
esophagus
and
pancreas
tobacco
smoke
contains
over
fifty
known
carcinogens
including
nitrosamines
and
polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons
tobacco
is
responsible
for
about
one
in
five
cancer
deaths
worldwide
and
about
one
in
three
in
the
developed
world
lung
cancer
death
rates
in
the
united

have
mirrored
smoking
patterns
with
increases
in
smoking
followed
by
dramatic
increases
in

death
rates
and
more
recently
decreases
in

death
rates
in

a

physical

is
believed
to
contribute

risk
not
only
through
its
effect
on
body
weight
but
also
through
negative
effects
on
the
immune
system
and
endocrine
system
more
than
half
of
the
effect
from

national
differences
in
dietary
practices
may
partly
explain
differences
in
cancer
incidence
for
example
gastric
cancer
is
more
common
in
japan
due

its
high-salt
diet
while
colon
cancer
is
more

in
the
united

immigrant
cancer
profiles

country
often
within

worldwide
approximately
of
cancer
deaths
are

to
infectious
diseases
this
proportion
ranges
from
a
high
of
in

to
less
than
in
the

viruses
are
the

infectious
agents
that

sources
of

include
medical

and
radon

is
not
a
particularly
strong
mutagen
residential
exposure
to
radon
gas
for
example
has
similar
cancer
risks
as
passive

radiation
is
a
more
potent
source
of
cancer
when
combined
with
other
cancer-causing
agents
such
as
radon
plus
tobacco
smoke
radiation
can
cause
cancer
in
most
parts
of
the
body
in
all
animals
and
at
any
age
children
and
adolescents
are
twice
as
likely
to
develop
radiation-induced

has
ten
times
the

medical
use
of
ionizing

is
a
small
but
growing
source
of
radiation-induced
cancers
ionizing
radiation
may
be
used
to
treat
other
cancers
but
this
may
in
some
cases
induce
a
second
form
of
cancer
it
is
also
used
in
some
kinds
of
medical
imaging
prolonged
exposure
to
ultraviolet
radiation
from
the
sun
can
lead
to
melanoma
and
other
skin
malignancies
clear
evidence
establishes
ultraviolet
radiation
especially
the
non-ionizing

wave
uvb
as
the
cause
of
most
non-melanoma
skin
cancers
which
are
the
most
common
forms
of
cancer
in
the
world
non-ionizing
radio
frequency
radiation
from
mobile
phones
electric
power
transmission
and
other
similar
sources
have
been
described
as
a
possible
carcinogen
by
the
world
health
organization's
international
agency
for
research
on
cancer
however
studies
have
not
found
a
consistent
link
between
mobile
phone
radiation
and
cancer
risk
the
vast
majority
of
cancers
are
non-hereditary
sporadic
hereditary
cancers
are
primarily
caused
by
an
inherited
genetic
defect
less
than
of
the
population
are
carriers
of
a
genetic
mutation
that
has
a
large
effect
on
cancer
risk
and
these
cause
less
than
–
of
cancer
some
of
these
syndromes
include:
certain
inherited
mutations
in
the
genes
brca
and
brca
with
a
more
than
risk
of
breast
cancer
and
ovarian
cancer
and
hereditary
nonpolyposis
colorectal
cancer
hnpcc
or
lynch
syndrome
which
is
present
in
about
of
people
with
colorectal
cancer
among
others
statistically
for
cancers
causing
most
mortality
the
relative
risk
of
developing
colorectal
cancer
when
a
first-degree
relative
parent
sibling
or
child
has
been
diagnosed
with
it
is
about
the
corresponding
relative
risk
is
for
lung
cancer
and
for
prostate
cancer
for
breast
cancer
the
relative
risk
is
with
a
first-degree
relative
having
developed
it
at
years
of
age
or
older
and
when
the
relative
developed
it
when
being
younger
than
years
of
age
taller
people
have
an
increased
risk
of
cancer
because
they
have
more
cells
than
shorter
people
since
height
is
genetically
determined
to
a
large
extent
taller
people
have
a
heritable
increase
of
cancer
risk
some
substances
cause
cancer
primarily
through
their
physical
rather
than
chemical
effects
a
prominent
example
of
this
is
prolonged
exposure
to
asbestos
naturally
occurring
mineral
fibers
that
are
a
major
cause
of
mesothelioma
cancer
of
the
serous
membrane
usually
the
serous
membrane
surrounding
the
lungs
other
substances
in
this
category
including
both
naturally
occurring
and
synthetic
asbestos-like
fibers
such
as
wollastonite
attapulgite
glass
wool
and
rock
wool
are
believed
to
have
similar
effects
non-fibrous
particulate
materials
that
cause
cancer
include
powdered
metallic
cobalt
and
nickel
and
crystalline
silica
quartz
cristobalite
and
tridymite
usually
physical
carcinogens
must
get
inside
the
body
such
as
through
inhalation
and
require
years
of
exposure
to
produce
cancer
physical
trauma
resulting
in
cancer
is
relatively
rare
claims
that
breaking
bones
resulted
in
bone
cancer
for
example
have
not
been
proven
similarly
physical
trauma
is
not
accepted
as
a
cause
for
cervical
cancer
breast
cancer
or
brain
cancer
one
accepted
source
is
frequent
long-term
application
of
hot
objects
to
the
body
it
is
possible
that
repeated
burns
on
the
same
part
of
the
body
such
as
those
produced
by
kanger
and
kairo
heaters
charcoal
hand
warmers
may
produce
skin
cancer
especially
if
carcinogenic
chemicals
are
also
present
frequent
consumption
of
scalding
hot
tea
may
produce
esophageal
cancer
generally
it
is
believed
that
cancer
arises
or
a
pre-existing
cancer
is
encouraged
during
the
process
of
healing
rather
than
directly
by
the
trauma
however
repeated
injuries
to
the
same
tissues
might
promote
excessive
cell
proliferation
which
could
then
increase
the
odds
of
a
cancerous
mutation
chronic
inflammation
has
been
hypothesized
to
directly
cause
mutation
inflammation
can
contribute
to
proliferation
survival
angiogenesis
and
migration
of
cancer
cells
by
influencing
the
tumor
microenvironment
oncogenes
build
up
an
inflammatory
pro-tumorigenic
microenvironment
some
hormones
play
a
role
in
the
development
of
cancer
by
promoting
cell
proliferation
insulin-like
growth
factors
and
their
binding
proteins
play
a
key
role
in
cancer
cell
proliferation
differentiation
and
apoptosis
suggesting
possible
involvement
in
carcinogenesis
hormones
are
important
agents
in
sex-related
cancers
such
as
cancer
of
the
breast
endometrium
prostate
ovary
and
testis
and
also
of
thyroid
cancer
and
bone
cancer
for
example
the
daughters
of
women
who
have
breast
cancer
have
significantly
higher
levels
of
estrogen
and
progesterone
than
the
daughters
of
women
without
breast
cancer
these
higher
hormone
levels
may
explain
their
higher
risk
of
breast
cancer
even
in
the
absence
of
a
breast-cancer
gene
similarly
men
of
african
ancestry
have
significantly
higher
levels
of
testosterone
than
men
of
european
ancestry
and
have
a
correspondingly
higher
level
of
prostate
cancer
men
of
asian
ancestry
with
the
lowest
levels
of
testosterone-activating
androstanediol
glucuronide
have
the
lowest
levels
of
prostate
cancer
other
factors
are
relevant:
obese
people
have
higher
levels
of
some
hormones
associated
with
cancer
and
a
higher
rate
of
those
cancers
women
who
take
hormone
replacement
therapy
have
a
higher
risk
of
developing
cancers
associated
with
those
hormones
on
the
other
hand
people
who
exercise
far
more
than
average
have
lower
levels
of
these
hormones
and
lower
risk
of
cancer
osteosarcoma
may
be
promoted
by
growth
hormones
some
treatments
and
prevention
approaches
leverage
this
cause
by
artificially
reducing
hormone
levels
and
thus
discouraging
hormone-sensitive
cancers
there
is
an
association
between
celiac
disease
and
an
increased
risk
of
all
cancers
people
with
untreated
celiac
disease
have
a
higher
risk
but
this
risk
decreases
with
time
after
diagnosis
and
strict
treatment
probably
due
to
the
adoption
of
a
gluten-free
diet
which
seems
to
have
a
protective
role
against
development
of
malignancy
in
people
with
celiac
disease
however
the
delay
in
diagnosis
and
initiation
of
a
gluten-free
diet
seems
to
increase
the
risk
of
malignancies
rates
of
gastrointestinal
cancers
are
increased
in
people
with
crohn's
disease
and
ulcerative
colitis
due
to
chronic
inflammation
also
immunomodulators
and
biologic
agents
used
to
treat
these
diseases
may
promote
developing
extra-intestinal
malignancies
cancer
is
fundamentally
a
disease
of
tissue
growth
regulation
in
order
for
a
normal
cell
to
transform
into
a
cancer
cell
the
genes
that
regulate
cell
growth
and
differentiation
must
be
altered
the
affected
genes
are
divided
into
two
broad
categories
oncogenes
are
genes
that
promote
cell
growth
and
reproduction
tumor
suppressor
genes
are
genes
that
inhibit
cell
division
and
survival
malignant
transformation
can
occur
through
the
formation
of
novel
oncogenes
the
inappropriate
over-expression
of
normal
oncogenes
or
by
the
under-expression
or
disabling
of
tumor
suppressor
genes
typically
changes
in
multiple
genes
are
required
to
transform
a
normal
cell
into
a
cancer
cell
genetic
changes
can
occur
at
different
levels
and
by
different
mechanisms
the
gain
or
loss
of
an
entire
chromosome
can
occur
through
errors
in
mitosis
more
common
are
mutations
which
are
changes
in
the
nucleotide
sequence
of
genomic
dna
large-scale
mutations
involve
the
deletion
or
gain
of
a
portion
of
a
chromosome
genomic
amplification
occurs
when
a
cell
gains
copies
often
or
more
of
a
small
chromosomal
locus
usually
containing
one
or
more
oncogenes
and
adjacent
genetic
material
translocation
occurs
when
two
separate
chromosomal
regions
become
abnormally
fused
often
at
a
characteristic
location
a
well-known
example
of
this
is
the
philadelphia
chromosome
or
translocation
of
chromosomes
and
which
occurs
in
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
and
results
in
production
of
the
bcr-abl
fusion
protein
an
oncogenic
tyrosine
kinase
small-scale
mutations
include
point
mutations
deletions
and
insertions
which
may
occur
in
the
promoter
region
of
a
gene
and
affect
its
expression
or
may
occur
in
the
gene's
coding
sequence
and
alter
the
function
or
stability
of
its

the
signs
and
symptoms
of
malaria
typically
begin
–
days
following
infection
but
may
occur
later
in
those
who
have
taken
antimalarial
medications
as
prevention
initial
manifestations
of
the
disease—common
to
all
malaria
species—are
similar
to
flu-like
symptoms
and
can
resemble
other
conditions
such
as

the
presentation
may
include
headache
fever
shivering
joint
pain
vomiting
hemolytic

and
convulsions
the
classic
symptom
of
malaria
is
paroxysm—a
cyclical
occurrence
of
sudden
coldness
followed
by
shivering
and
then
fever
and
sweating
occurring
every
two
days
tertian

in
p

infections
and
every
three

quartan
fever
for

infection
can
cause
recurrent
fever
every

pronounced
and
almost
continuous
fever
severe
malaria
is
usually
caused
by
p

often
referred
to
as
falciparum
malaria
symptoms
of
falciparum
malaria
arise
–
days
after

individuals
with

frequently
exhibit
neurological
symptoms
including
abnormal

failure
of
the

malaria
has
several
serious
complications
among
these
is
the
development
of
respiratory
distress
which
occurs
in
up
to
of
adults
and
of
children
with
severe
p
falciparum
malaria
possible
causes
include
respiratory
compensation
of
metabolic

noncardiogenic
pulmonary
oedema
concomitant
pneumonia
and
severe

although
rare
in
young
children
with
severe

acute
respiratory

syndrome
occurs
in
–
of
adults
and
up
to
of

increases
mortality
renal

is
a
feature
of
blackwater

infection
with

may
result
in

a
form
of
severe
malaria
that
involves
encephalopathy
it
is
associated
with
retinal

which
may
be
a
useful
clinical
sign
in

among
those

p

is
the
most
common
species
identified
followed
by
p
vivax
although
p
falciparum
traditionally
accounts
for
the
majority
of
deaths
recent
evidence
suggests
that
p
vivax
malaria
is
associated
with
potentially
life-threatening
conditions
about
as
often
as
with
a
diagnosis
of
p
falciparum
infection
p
vivax
proportionally
is
more
common
outside
africa
there
have
been
documented
human
infections
with
several
species
of
plasmodium
from
higher
apes
however
except
for
p
knowlesi—a
zoonotic
species
that
causes
malaria
in
macaques—these
are
mostly
of
limited
public
health
importance
in
the
life
cycle
of
plasmodium
a
female
anopheles
mosquito
the
definitive
host
transmits
a
motile
infective
form
called
the
sporozoite
to
a
vertebrate
host
such
as
a
human
the
secondary
host
thus
acting
as
a
transmission
vector
a
sporozoite
travels
through
the
blood
vessels
to
liver
cells
hepatocytes
where
it
reproduces
asexually
tissue
schizogony
producing
thousands
of
merozoites
these
infect
new
red
blood
cells
and
initiate
a
series
of
asexual
multiplication
cycles
blood
schizogony
that
produce
to
new
infective
merozoites
at
which
point
the
cells
burst
and
the
infective
cycle
begins
anew
other
merozoites
develop
into
immature
gametocytes
which
are
the
precursors
of
male
and
female
gametes
when
a
fertilized
mosquito
bites
an
infected
person
gametocytes
are
taken
up
with
the
blood
and
mature
in
the
mosquito
gut
the
male
and
female
gametocytes
fuse
and
form
an
ookinete—a
fertilized
motile
zygote
ookinetes
develop
into
new
sporozoites
that
migrate
to
the
insect's
salivary
glands
ready
to
infect
a
new
vertebrate
host
the
sporozoites
are
injected
into
the
skin
in
the
saliva
when
the
mosquito
takes
a
subsequent
blood
meal
only
female
mosquitoes
feed
on
blood
male
mosquitoes
feed
on
plant
nectar
and
do
not
transmit
the

females
of
the
mosquito
genus
anopheles
prefer
to
feed
at
night
they
usually
start
searching
for
a
meal
at
dusk
and
will
continue
throughout
the
night
until
taking
a
meal
malaria
parasites
can
also
be
transmitted
by
blood
transfusions
although
this
is
rare
symptoms
of
malaria
can
recur
after
varying
symptom-free
periods
depending
upon
the
cause
recurrence
can
be
classified
as
either
recrudescence
relapse
or
reinfection
recrudescence
is
when
symptoms
return
after
a
symptom-free
period
it
is
caused
by
parasites
surviving
in
the
blood
as
a
result
of
inadequate
or
ineffective
treatment
relapse
is
when
symptoms
reappear
after
the
parasites
have
been
eliminated
from
blood
but
persist
as
dormant
hypnozoites
in
liver
cells
relapse
commonly
occurs
between
–
weeks
and
is
often
seen
in
p
vivax
and
p
ovale
infections
however
relapse-like
p
vivax
recurrences
are
probably
being
over-attributed
to
hypnozoite
activation
some
of
them
might
have
an
extra-vascular
merozoite
origin
making
these
recurrences
recrudescences
not
relapses
one
newly
recognized
non-hypnozoite
possible
contributing
source
to
recurrent
peripheral
p
vivax
parasitemia
is
erythrocytic
forms
in
bone
marrow
p
vivax
malaria
cases
in
temperate
areas
often
involve
overwintering
by
hypnozoites
with
relapses
beginning
the
year
after
the
mosquito
bite
reinfection
means
the
parasite
that
caused
the
past
infection
was
eliminated
from
the
body
but
a
new
parasite
was
introduced
reinfection
cannot
readily
be
distinguished
from
recrudescence
although
recurrence
of
infection
within
two
weeks
of
treatment
for
the
initial
infection
is
typically
attributed
to
treatment
failure
people
may
develop
some
immunity
when
exposed
to
frequent
infections
global
climate
change
is
likely
to
affect
malaria
transmission
but
the
degree
of
effect
and
the
areas
effected
is
uncertain
greater
rainfall
in
certain
areas
of
india
and
following
an

associated
with
increased
mosquito
numbers
malaria
infection
develops
via
two
phases:
one
that
involves
the
liver
exoerythrocytic
phase
and
one
that
involves
red
blood
cells
or
erythrocytes
erythrocytic
phase
when
an
infected
mosquito
pierces
a
person's
skin
to
take
a
blood
meal
sporozoites
in
the
mosquito's
saliva
enter
the
bloodstream
and
migrate
to
the
liver
where
they
infect
hepatocytes
multiplying
asexually
and
asymptomatically
for
a
period
of
–
days
after
a
potential
dormant
period
in
the
liver
these
organisms
differentiate
to
yield
thousands
of
merozoites
which
following
rupture
of
their
host
cells
escape
into
the
blood
and
infect
red
blood
cells
to
begin
the
erythrocytic
stage
of
the
life
cycle
the
parasite
escapes
from
the
liver
undetected
by
wrapping
itself
in
the
cell
membrane
of
the
infected
host
liver
cell
within
the
red
blood
cells
the
parasites
multiply
further
again
asexually
periodically
breaking
out
of
their
host
cells
to
invade
fresh
red
blood
cells
several
such
amplification
cycles
occur
thus
classical
descriptions
of
waves
of
fever
arise
from
simultaneous
waves
of
merozoites
escaping
and
infecting
red
blood
cells
some
p
vivax
sporozoites
do
not
immediately
develop
into
exoerythrocytic-phase
merozoites
but
instead
produce
hypnozoites
that
remain
dormant
for
periods
ranging
from
several
months
–
months
is
typical
to
several
years
after
a
period
of
dormancy
they
reactivate
and
produce
merozoites
hypnozoites
are
responsible
for
long
incubation
and
late
relapses
in
p
vivax
infections
although
their
existence
in
p
ovale
is
uncertain
the
parasite
is
relatively
protected
from
attack
by
the
body's
immune
system
because
for
most
of
its
human
life
cycle
it
resides
within
the
liver
and
blood
cells
and
is
relatively
invisible
to
immune
surveillance
however
circulating
infected
blood
cells
are
destroyed
in
the
spleen
to
avoid
this
fate
the
p
falciparum
parasite
displays
adhesive
proteins
on
the
surface
of
the
infected
blood
cells
causing
the
blood
cells
to
stick
to
the
walls
of
small
blood
vessels
thereby
sequestering
the
parasite
from
passage
through
the
general
circulation
and
the
spleen
the
blockage
of
the
microvasculature
causes
symptoms
such
as
in
placental
malaria
sequestered
red
blood
cells
can
breach
the
blood–brain
barrier
and
cause
cerebral
malaria
according
to
a
review
due
to
the
high
levels
of
mortality
and
morbidity
caused
by
malaria—especially
the
p
falciparum
species—it
has
placed
the
greatest
selective
pressure
on
the
human
genome
in
recent
history
several
genetic
factors
provide
some
resistance
to
it
including
sickle
cell
trait
thalassaemia
traits
glucose--phosphate
dehydrogenase
deficiency
and
the
absence
of
duffy
antigens
on
red
blood
cells
the
impact
of
sickle
cell
trait
on
malaria
immunity
illustrates
some
evolutionary
trade-offs
that
have
occurred
because
of
endemic
malaria
sickle
cell
trait
causes
a
change
in
the
hemoglobin
molecule
in
the
blood
normally
red
blood
cells
have
a
very
flexible
biconcave
shape
that
allows
them
to
move
through
narrow
capillaries
however
when
the
modified
hemoglobin
molecules
are
exposed
to
low
amounts
of
oxygen
or
crowd
together
due
to
dehydration
they
can
stick
together
forming
strands
that
cause
the
cell
to
sickle
or
distort
into
a
curved
shape
in
these
strands
the
molecule
is
not
as
effective
in
taking
or
releasing
oxygen
and
the
cell
is
not
flexible
enough
to
circulate
freely
in
the
early
stages
of
malaria
the
parasite
can
cause
infected
red
cells
to
sickle
and
so
they
are
removed
from
circulation
sooner
this
reduces
the
frequency
with
which
malaria
parasites
complete
their
life
cycle
in
the
cell
individuals
who
are
homozygous
with
two
copies
of
the
abnormal
hemoglobin
beta
allele
have
sickle-cell
anaemia
while
those
who
are
heterozygous
with
one
abnormal
allele
and
one
normal
allele
experience
resistance
to
malaria
without
severe
anemia
although
the
shorter
life
expectancy
for
those
with
the
homozygous
condition
would
tend
to
disfavor
the
trait's
survival
the
trait
is
preserved
in
malaria-prone
regions
because
of
the
benefits
provided
by
the
heterozygous
form
liver
dysfunction
as
a
result
of
malaria
is
uncommon
and
usually
only
occurs
in
those
with
another
liver
condition
such
as
viral
hepatitis
or
chronic
liver
disease
the
syndrome
is
sometimes
called
malarial
hepatitis
while
it
has
been
considered
a
rare
occurrence
malarial
hepatopathy
has
seen
an
increase
particularly
in
southeast
asia
and
india
liver
compromise
in
people
with
malaria
correlates
with
a
greater
likelihood
of
complications
and
death
owing
to
the
non-specific
nature
of
the
presentation
of
symptoms
diagnosis
of
malaria
in
non-endemic
areas
requires
a
high
degree
of
suspicion
which
might
be
elicited
by
any
of
the
following:
recent
travel
history
enlarged
spleen
fever
low
number
of
platelets
in
the
blood
and
higher-than-normal
levels
of
bilirubin
in
the
blood
combined
with
a
normal
level
of
white
blood
cells
reports
in
and
from
countries
were
malaria
is
common
suggest
high
levels
of
over
diagnosis
due
to
insufficient
or
inaccurate
laboratory
testing
malaria
is
usually
confirmed
by
the
microscopic
examination
of
blood
films
or
by
antigen-based
rapid
diagnostic
tests
rdt
in
some
areas
rdts
need
to
be
able
to
distinguish
whether
the
malaria
symptoms
are
caused
by
plasmodium
falciparum
or
by
other
species
of
parasites
since
treatment
strategies
could
differ
for
non-p
falciparum
infections
microscopy
is
the
most
commonly
used
method
to
detect
the
malarial
parasite—about
million
blood
films
were
examined
for
malaria
in
despite
its
widespread
usage
diagnosis
by
microscopy
suffers
from
two
main
drawbacks:
many
settings
especially
rural
are
not
equipped
to
perform
the
test
and
the
accuracy
of
the
results
depends
on
both
the
skill
of
the
person
examining
the
blood
film
and
the
levels
of
the
parasite
in
the
blood
the
sensitivity
of
blood
films
ranges
from
–
in
optimum
conditions
to
as
low
as
commercially
available
rdts
are
often
more
accurate
than
blood
films
at
predicting
the
presence
of
malaria
parasites
but
they
are
widely
variable
in
diagnostic
sensitivity
and
specificity
depending
on
manufacturer
and
are
unable
to
tell
how
many
parasites
are
present
in
regions
where
laboratory
tests
are
readily
available
malaria
should
be
suspected
and
tested
for
in
any
unwell
person
who
has
been
in
an
area
where
malaria
is
endemic
in
areas
that
cannot
afford
laboratory
diagnostic
tests
it
has
become
common
to
use
only
a
history
of
fever
as
the
indication
to
treat
for
malaria—thus
the
common
teaching
fever
equals
malaria
unless
proven
otherwise
a
drawback
of
this
practice
is
overdiagnosis
of
malaria
and
mismanagement
of
non-malarial
fever
which
wastes
limited
resources
erodes
confidence
in
the
health
care
system
and
contributes
to
drug
resistance
although
polymerase
chain
reaction-based
tests
have
been
developed
they
are
not
widely
used
in
areas
where
malaria
is
common
as
of
due

their
complexity

have

below:
methods
used
to
prevent
malaria
include
medications
mosquito
elimination
and
the
prevention
of
bites
there
is
no
vaccine
for
malaria
the
presence
of
malaria
in
an
area
requires
a
combination
of
high
human
population
density
high
anopheles
mosquito
population
density
and
high
rates
of
transmission
from
humans
to
mosquitoes
and
from
mosquitoes
to
humans
if
any
of
these
is
lowered
sufficiently
the
parasite
will
eventually
disappear
from
that
area
as
happened
in
north
america
europe
and
parts
of
the
middle
east
however
unless
the
meaning
of
health
has
evolved
over
time
in
keeping
with
the
biomedical
perspective
early
definitions
of
health
focused
on
the
theme
of
the
body's
ability
to
function
health
was
seen
as
a
state
of
normal
function
that
could
be
disrupted
from
time
to
time
by
disease
an
example
of
such
a
definition
of
health
is:
a
state
characterized
by
anatomic
physiologic
and
psychological
integrity
ability
to
perform
personally
valued
family
work
and
community
roles
ability
to
deal
with
physical
biological
psychological
and
social
stress
then
in
in
a
radical
departure
from
previous
definitions
the
world
health
organization
who
proposed
a
definition
that
aimed
higher:
linking
health
to
well-being
in
terms
of
physical
mental
and
social
well-being
and
not
merely
the
absence
of
disease
and
infirmity
although
this
definition
was
welcomed
by
some
as
being
innovative
it
was
also
criticized
as
being
vague
excessively
broad
and
was
not
construed
as
measurable
for
a
long
time
it
was
set
aside
as
an
impractical
ideal
and
most
discussions
of
health
returned
to
the
practicality
of
the
biomedical
model
just
as
there
was
a
shift
from
viewing
disease
as
a
state
to
thinking
of
it
as
a
process
the
same
shift
happened
in
definitions
of
health
again
the
who
played
a
leading
role
when
it
fostered
the
development
of
the
health
promotion
movement
in
the
this
brought
in
a
new
conception
of
health
not
as
a
state
but
in
dynamic
terms
of
resiliency
in
other
words
as
a
resource
for
living
who
revised
the
definition
of
health
defined
it
as
the
extent
to
which
an
individual
or
group
is
able
to
realize
aspirations
and
satisfy
needs
and
to
change
or
cope
with
the
environment
health
is
a
resource
for
everyday
life
not
the
objective
of
living
it
is
a
positive
concept
emphasizing
social
and
personal
resources
as
well
as
physical
capacities
thus
health
referred
to
the
ability
to
maintain
homeostasis
and
recover
from
insults
mental
intellectual
emotional
and
social
health
referred
to
a
person's
ability
to
handle
stress
to
acquire
skills
to
maintain
relationships
all
of
which
form
resources
for
resiliency
and
independent
living
this
opens
up
many
possibilities
for
health
to
be
taught
strengthened
and
learned
since
the
late
the
federal
healthy
people
initiative
has
been
a
visible
component
of
the
united
states’
approach
to
improving
population
health
in
each
decade
a
new
version
of
healthy
people
is
issued
featuring
updated
goals
and
identifying
topic
areas
and
quantifiable
objectives
for
health
improvement
during
the
succeeding
ten
years
with
assessment
at
that
point
of
progress
or
lack
thereof
progress
has
been
limited
to
many
objectives
leading
to
concerns
about
the
effectiveness
of
healthy
the
word
insect
comes
from
the
latin
word
insectum
meaning
with
a
notched
or
divided
body
or
literally
cut
into
from
the
neuter
singular
perfect
passive
participle
of
insectare
to
cut
into
to
cut
up
from
in-
into
and
secare
to
cut
because
insects
appear
cut
into
three
sections
a
calque
of
greek
ἔντομον
[éntomon]
cut
into

pliny
the
elder
introduced
the
latin
designation
as
a
loan-translation
of
the
greek
word
ἔντομος
éntomos
or
insect
as
in
entomology
which
was
aristotle's
term
for
this
class
of
life
also
in
reference
to
their
notched
bodies
insect
first
appears
documented
in
english
in
in
holland's
translation
of

translations
of
aristotle's

the
precise
definition
of
the
taxon
insecta
and
the
equivalent
english
name
insect
varies
three
alternative
definitions
are
shown
in
the
table
in
the
broadest
circumscription
insecta
sensu
lato
consists
of
all
hexapods
traditionally
insects
defined
in
this
way
were
divided
into
apterygota
the
first
five
groups
in
the
table
–
the
wingless
insects
–
and
pterygota
–
the
winged
insects
however
modern
phylogenetic
studies
have
shown
that
apterygota
is
not
monophyletic
and
so
does
not
form
a
good
taxon
a
narrower
circumscription
restricts
insects
to
those
hexapods
with
external
mouthparts
and
comprises
only
the
last
three
groups
in
the
table
in
this
sense
insecta
sensu
stricto
is
equivalent
to
ectognatha
in
the
narrowest
circumscription
insects
are
restricted
to
hexapods
that
are
either
winged
or
descended
from
winged
ancestors
insecta
sensu
strictissimo
is
then
equivalent
to
pterygota
for
the
purposes
of
this
article
the
middle
definition
is
used
insects
consist
of
two
wingless
taxa
archaeognatha
jumping
bristletails
and
zygentoma
silverfish
plus
the
winged
or
secondarily
wingless
pterygota
the
evolutionary
relationship
of
insects
to
other
animal
groups
remains
unclear
although
traditionally
grouped
with
millipedes
and
centipedes—possibly
on
the
basis
of
convergent
adaptations
to
terrestrialisation—evidence
has
emerged
favoring
closer
evolutionary
ties
with
crustaceans
in
the
pancrustacea
theory
insects
together
with
entognatha
remipedia
and
cephalocarida
make
up
a
natural
clade
labeled
miracrustacea
insects
form
a
single
clade
closely
related
to
crustaceans
and
myriapods
other
terrestrial
arthropods
such
as
centipedes
millipedes
scorpions
and
spiders
are
sometimes
confused
with
insects
since
their
body
plans
can
appear
similar
sharing
as
do
all
arthropods
a
jointed
exoskeleton
however
upon
closer
examination
their
features
differ
significantly
most
noticeably
they
do
not
have
the
six-legged
characteristic
of
adult
insects
the
higher-level
phylogeny
of
the
arthropods
continues
to
be
a
matter
of
debate
and
research
in
researchers
at
tufts
university
uncovered
what
they
believe
is
the
world's
oldest
known
full-body
impression
of
a
primitive
flying
insect
a
-million-year-old
specimen
from
the
carboniferous
period
the
oldest
definitive
insect
fossil
is
the
devonian
rhyniognatha
hirsti
from
the
-million-year-old
rhynie
chert
it
may
have
superficially
resembled
a
modern-day
silverfish
insect
this
species
already
possessed
dicondylic
mandibles
two
articulations
in
the
mandible
a
feature
associated
with
winged
insects
suggesting
that
wings
may
already
have
evolved
at
this
time
thus
the
first
insects
probably
appeared
earlier
in
the
silurian
period
four
super
radiations
of
insects
have
occurred:
beetles
evolved
about
million
years
ago
flies
evolved
about
million
years
ago
and
moths
and
wasps
evolved
about
million
years
ago
these
four
groups
account
for
the
majority
of
described
species
the
flies
and
moths
along
with
the
fleas
evolved
from
the
mecoptera
the
origins
of
insect
flight
remain
obscure
since
the
earliest
winged
insects
currently
known
appear
to
have
been
capable
fliers
some
extinct
insects
had
an
additional
pair
of
winglets
attaching
to
the
first
segment
of
the
thorax
for
a
total
of
three
pairs
as
of
no
evidence
suggests
the
insects
were
a
particularly
successful
group
of
animals
before
they
evolved
to
have
wings
late
carboniferous
and
early
permian
insect
orders
include
both
extant
groups
their
stem
groups
and
a
number
of
paleozoic
groups
now
extinct
during
this
era
some
giant
dragonfly-like
forms
reached
wingspans
of
to
cm
to
in
making
them
far
larger
than
any
living
insect
this
gigantism
may
have
been
due
to
higher
atmospheric
oxygen
levels
that
allowed
increased
respiratory
efficiency
relative
to
today
the
lack
of
flying
vertebrates
could
have
been
another
factor
most
extinct
orders
of
insects
developed
during
the
permian
period
that
began
around
million
years
ago
many
of
the
early
groups
became
extinct
during
the
permian-triassic
extinction
event
the
largest
mass
extinction
in
the
history
of
the
earth
around
million
years
ago
the
remarkably
successful
hymenoptera
appeared
as
long
as
million
years
ago
in
the
cretaceous
period
but
achieved
their
wide
diversity
more
recently
in
the
cenozoic
era
which
began
million
years
ago
a
number
of
highly
successful
insect
groups
evolved
in
conjunction
with
flowering
plants
a
powerful
illustration
of
coevolution
many
modern
insect
genera
developed
during
the
cenozoic
insects
from
this
period
on
are
often
found
preserved
in
amber
often
in
perfect
condition
the
body
plan
or
morphology
of
such
specimens
is
thus
easily
compared
with
modern
species
the
study
of
fossilized
insects
is
called
paleoentomology
insects
are
prey
for
a
variety
of
organisms
including
terrestrial
vertebrates
the
earliest
vertebrates
on
land
existed
million
years
ago
and
were
large
amphibious
piscivores
through
gradual
evolutionary
change
insectivory
was
the
next
diet
type
to
evolve
insects
were
among
the
earliest
terrestrial
herbivores
and
acted
as
major
selection
agents
on
plants
plants
evolved
chemical
defenses
against
this
herbivory
and
the
insects
in
turn
evolved
mechanisms
to
deal
with
plant
toxins
many
insects
make
use
of
these
toxins
to
protect
themselves
from
their
predators
such
insects
often
advertise
their
toxicity
using
warning
colors
this
successful
evolutionary
pattern
has
also
been
used
by
mimics
over
time
this
has
led
to
complex
groups
of
coevolved
species
conversely
some
interactions
between
plants
and
insects
like
pollination
are
beneficial
to
both
organisms
coevolution
has
led
to
the
development
of
very
specific
mutualisms
in
such
systems
traditional
morphology-based
or
appearance-based
systematics
have
usually
given
the
hexapoda
the
rank
of
superclass
and
identified
four
groups
within
it:
insects
ectognatha
springtails
collembola
protura
and
diplura
the
latter
three
being
grouped
together
as
the
entognatha
on
the
basis
of
internalized
mouth
parts
supraordinal
relationships
have
undergone
numerous
changes
with
the
advent
of
methods
based
on
evolutionary
history
and
genetic
data
a
recent
theory
is
that
the
hexapoda
are
polyphyletic
where
the
last
common
ancestor
was
not
a
member
of
the
group
with
the
entognath
classes
having
separate
evolutionary
histories
from
the
insecta
many
of
the
traditional
appearance-based
taxa
have
been
shown
to
be
paraphyletic
so
rather
than
using
ranks
like
subclass
superorder
and
infraorder
it
has
proved
better
to
use
monophyletic
groupings
in
which
the
last

insects
can
be
divided
into
two
groups
historically
treated
as
subclasses:
wingless
insects
known
as
apterygota
and
winged
insects
known
as
pterygota
the
apterygota
consist
of
the
primitively
wingless
order
of
the
silverfish
zygentoma
archaeognatha
make
up
the
monocondylia
based
on
the
shape
of
their
mandibles
while
zygentoma
and
pterygota
are
grouped
together
as
dicondylia
the
zygentoma
themselves
possibly
are
not
monophyletic
with
the
family
lepidotrichidae
being
a
sister
group
to
the
dicondylia
pterygota
and
the
remaining
zygentoma
paleoptera
and
neoptera
are
the
winged
orders
of
insects
differentiated
by
the
presence
of
hardened
body
parts
called
sclerites
and
in
the
neoptera
muscles
that
allow
their
wings
to
fold
flatly
over
the
abdomen
neoptera
can
further
be
divided
into
incomplete
metamorphosis-based
polyneoptera
and
paraneoptera
and
complete
metamorphosis-based
groups
it
has
proved
difficult
to
clarify
the
relationships
between
the
orders
in
polyneoptera
because
of
constant
new
findings
calling
for
revision
of
the
taxa
for
example
the
paraneoptera
have
turned
out
to
be
more
closely
related
to
the
endopterygota
than
to
the
rest
of
the
exopterygota
the
recent
molecular
finding
that
the
traditional
louse
orders
mallophaga
and
anoplura
are
derived
from
within
psocoptera
has
led
to
the
new
taxon
psocodea
phasmatodea
and
embiidina
have
been
suggested
to
form
the
eukinolabia
mantodea
blattodea
and
isoptera
are
thought
to
form
a
monophyletic
group
termed
dictyoptera
the
exopterygota
likely
are
paraphyletic
in
regard
to
the
endopterygota
matters
that
have
incurred
controversy
include
strepsiptera
and
diptera
grouped
together
as
halteria
based
on
a
reduction
of
one
of
the
wing
pairs
–
a
position
not
well-supported
in
the

community
the
neuropterida
are
often
lumped
or
split
on
the

of
the
taxonomist

are
now
thought
to
be
closely

many
questions
remain
in
the

endopterygote
orders
particularly
the
hymenoptera
the

of
the

of
any
insect
is
called
systematic
entomology
if
one
works
with

or
even

the
term
may
also
be
made

to
that

are
categorised
as

the
only
living
representatives
of
the
reptile
clade
archosauria
during
the
late
aves
was
most
commonly
defined
phylogenetically
as
all
descendants
of
the
most
recent
common
ancestor
of
modern
birds
and
archaeopteryx
lithographica
however
an
earlier
definition
proposed
by
jacques
gauthier
gained
wide
currency
in
the
st
century
and
is
used
by
many
scientists
including
adherents
of
the
phylocode
system
gauthier
defined
aves
to
include
only
the
crown
group
of
the
set
of
modern
birds
this
was
done
by
excluding
most
groups
known
only
from
fossils
and
assigning
them
instead
to
the
avialae
in
part
to
avoid
the
uncertainties
about
the
placement
of
archaeopteryx
in
relation
to
animals
traditionally
thought
of
as
theropod
dinosaurs
gauthier
identified
four
different
definitions
for
the
same
biological
name
aves
which
is
a
problem
gauthier
proposed
to
reserve
the
term
aves
only
for
the
crown
group
consisting
of
the
last
common
ancestor
of
all
living
birds
and
all
of
its
descendants
which
corresponds
to
meaning
number
below
he
assigned
other
names
to
the
other
groups
aves
can
mean
all
archosaurs
closer
to
birds
than
to
crocodiles
alternately
avemetatarsalia
aves
can
mean
those
advanced
archosaurs
with
feathers
alternately
avifilopluma
aves
can
mean
those
feathered
dinosaurs
that
fly
alternately
avialae
aves
can
mean
the
last
common
ancestor
of
all
the
currently
living
birds
and
all
of
its
descendants
a
crown
group
in
this
sense
synonymous
with
neornithesunder
the
fourth
definition
archaeopteryx
is
an
avialan
and
not
a
member
of
aves
gauthier's
proposals
have
been
adopted
by
many
researchers
in
the
field
of
palaeontology
and
bird
evolution
though
the
exact
definitions
applied
have
been
inconsistent
avialae
initially
proposed
to
replace
the
traditional
fossil
content
of
aves
is
often
used
synonymously
with
the
vernacular
term
bird
by
these
researchers
most
researchers
define
avialae
as
branch-based
clade
though
definitions
vary
many
authors
have
used
a
definition
similar
to
all
theropods
closer
to
birds
than
to
deinonychus
avialae
is
also
occasionally
defined
as
an
apomorphy-based
clade
that
is
one
based
on
physical
characteristics
jacques
gauthier
who
named
avialae
in
re-defined
it
in
as
all
dinosaurs
that
possessed
feathered
wings
used
in
flapping
flight
and
the
birds
that
descended
from
them
based
on
fossil
and
biological
evidence
most
scientists
accept
that
birds
are
a
specialised
subgroup
of
theropod
dinosaurs
and
more
specifically
they
are
members
of
maniraptora
a
group
of
theropods
which
includes
dromaeosaurs
and
oviraptorids
among
others
as
scientists
have
discovered
more
theropods
closely
related
to
birds
the
previously
clear
distinction
between
non-birds
and
birds
has
become
blurred
recent
discoveries
in
the
liaoning
province
of
northeast
china
which
demonstrate
many
small
theropod
feathered
dinosaurs
contribute
to
this
ambiguity
the
consensus
view
in
contemporary
palaeontology
is
that
the
flying
theropods
or
avialans
are
the
closest
relatives
of
the
deinonychosaurs
which
include
dromaeosaurids
and
troodontids
together
these
form
a
group
called
paraves
some
basal
members
of
this
group
such
as
microraptor
have
features
which
may
have
enabled
them
to
glide
or
fly
the
most
basal
deinonychosaurs
were
very
small
this
evidence
raises
the
possibility
that
the
ancestor
of
all
paravians
may
have
been
arboreal
have
been
able
to
glide
or
both
unlike
archaeopteryx
and
the
non-avialan
feathered
dinosaurs
who
primarily
ate
meat
recent
studies
suggest
that
the
first
avialans
were
omnivores
the
late
jurassic
archaeopteryx
is
well
known
as
one
of
the
first
transitional
fossils
to
be
found
and
it
provided
support
for
the
theory
of
evolution
in
the
late
th
century
archaeopteryx
was
the
first
fossil
to
display
both
clearly
traditional
reptilian
characteristics:
teeth
clawed
fingers
and
a
long
lizard-like
tail
as
well
as
wings
with
flight
feathers
similar
to
those
of
modern
birds
it
is
not
considered
a
direct
ancestor
of
birds
though
it
is
possibly
closely
related
to
the
true
ancestor
the
earliest
known
avialan
fossils
come
from
the
tiaojishan
formation
of
china
which
has
been
dated
to
the
late
jurassic
period
oxfordian
stage
about
million
years
ago
the
avialan
species
from
this
time
period
include
anchiornis
huxleyi
xiaotingia
zhengi
and
aurornis
xui
the
well-known
early
avialan
archaeopteryx
dates
from
slightly
later
jurassic
rocks
about
million
years
old
from
germany
many
of
these
early
avialans
shared
unusual
anatomical
features
that
may
be
ancestral
to
modern
birds
but
were
later
lost
during
bird
evolution
these
features
include
enlarged
claws
on
the
second
toe
which
may
have
been
held
clear
of
the
ground
in
life
and
long
feathers
or
hind
wings
covering
the
hind
limbs
and
feet
which
may
have
been
used
in
aerial
maneuvering
avialans
diversified
into
a
wide
variety
of
forms
during
the
cretaceous
period
many
groups
retained
primitive
characteristics
such
as
clawed
wings
and
teeth
though
the
latter
were
lost
independently
in
a
number
of
avialan
groups
including
modern
birds
aves
while
the
earliest
forms
such
as
archaeopteryx
and
jeholornis
retained
the
long
bony
tails
of
their
ancestors
the
tails
of
more
advanced
avialans
were
shortened
with
the
advent
of
the
pygostyle
bone
in
the
group
pygostylia
in
the
late
cretaceous
about
million
years
ago
the
ancestors
of
all
modern
birds
evolved
a
more
open
pelvis
allowing
them
to
lay
larger
eggs
compared
to
body
size
around
million
years
ago
they
evolved
a
better
sense
of
smell
the
first
large
diverse
lineage
of
short-tailed
avialans
to
evolve
were
the
enantiornithes
or
opposite
birds
so
named
because
the
construction
of
their
shoulder
bones
was
in
reverse
to
that
of
modern
birds
enantiornithes
occupied
a
wide
array
of
ecological
niches
from
sand-probing
shorebirds
and
fish-eaters
to
tree-dwelling
forms
and
seed-eaters
while
they
were
the
dominant
group
of
avialans
during
the
cretaceous
period
enantiornithes
became
extinct
along
with
many
other
dinosaur
groups
at
the
end
of
the
mesozoic
era
many
species
of
the
second
major
avialan
lineage
to
diversify
the
euornithes
meaning
true
birds
because
they
include
the
ancestors
of
modern
birds
were
semi-aquatic
and
specialised
in
eating
fish
and
other
small
aquatic
organisms
unlike
the
enantiornithes
which
dominated
land-based
and
arboreal
habitats
most
early
euornithes
lacked
perching
adaptations
and
seem
to
have
included
shorebird-like
species
waders
and
swimming
and
diving
species
the
latter
included
the
superficially
gull-like
ichthyornis
the
hesperornithiformes
which
became
so
well
adapted
to
hunting
fish
in
marine
environments
that
they
lost
the
ability
to
fly
and
became
primarily
aquatic
the
early
euornithes
also
saw
the
development
of
many
traits
associated
with
modern
birds
like
strongly
keeled
breastbones
toothless
beaked
portions
of
their
jaws
though
most
non-avian
euornithes
retained
teeth
in
other
parts
of
the
jaws
euornithes
also
included
the
first
avialans
to
develop
true
pygostyle
and
a
fully
mobile
fan
of
tail
feathers
which
may
have
replaced
the
hind
wing
as
the
primary
mode
of
aerial
maneuverability
and
braking
in
flight
a
study
on
mosaic
evolution
in
the
avian
skull
found
that
the
last
common
ancestor
of
all
neornithines
might
have
had
a
beak
similar
to
that
of
the
modern
hook-billed
vanga
and
a
skull
similar
to
that
of
the
eurasian
golden
oriole
as
both
species
are
small
aerial
and
canopy
foraging
omnivores
a
similar
ecological
niche
was
inferred
for
this
hypothetical
ancestor
all
modern
birds
lie
within
the
crown

neornithes
which
has
two
subdivisions:
the
palaeognathae
which
includes
the
flightless
ratites
such
as
the
ostriches
and
the
weak-flying
tinamous
and
the
extremely
diverse
neognathae
containing
all
other
birds
these
two
subdivisions
are
often
given
the
rank
of
superorder
although
livezey
and
zusi
assigned
them
cohort
rank
depending
on
the
taxonomic
viewpoint
the
number
of
known
living
bird
species
varies
anywhere
from
to
the
discovery
of
vegavis
a
late
cretaceous
member
of
the
anatidae
proved
that
the
diversification
of
modern
birds
started
before
the
cenozoic
the
affinities
of
an
earlier
fossil
the
possible
galliform
austinornis
lentus
dated
to
about
million
years
ago
are
still
too
controversial
to
provide
a
fossil
evidence
of
modern
bird
diversification
most
studies
agree
on
a
cretaceous
age
for
the
most
recent
common
ancestor
of
modern
birds
but
estimates
range
from
the
middle
cretaceous
to
the
latest
late
cretaceous
similarly
there
is
no
agreement
on
whether
most
of
the
early
diversification
of
modern
birds
occurred
before
or
after
the
cretaceous–palaeogene
extinction
event
this
disagreement
is
in
part
caused
by
a
divergence
in
the
evidence
most
molecular
dating
studies
suggests
a
cretaceous
radiation
while
fossil
evidence
points
to
a

radiation
the
so-called
'rocks'

'clocks'
controversy
previous
attempts
to

proved
controversial
but
more
recent
estimates
using
a
more
comprehensive
sample
of
fossils
and
a
new
way
of
calibrating
molecular
clocks
showed
that
while
modern
birds
originated
early
in
the
late
cretaceous
a
pulse
of
diversification
in
all
major

occurred
around

however
recent

found

several

this
material
as
well
as
the
output
of
the
intestines
emerges
from
the
bird's
cloaca
the
cloaca
is
a
multi-purpose
opening:
waste
is
expelled
through
it
most
birds
mate
by
joining
cloaca
and
females
lay
eggs
from
it
in
addition
many
species
of
birds
regurgitate
pellets
males
within
palaeognathae
with
the
exception
of
the
kiwis
the
anseriformes
with
the
exception
of
screamers
and
in
rudimentary
forms
in
galliformes
but
fully
developed
in
cracidae
possess
a
penis
which
is
never
present
in
neoaves
the

thought
to
be
related
to
sperm
competition
when
not
copulating
it
is
hidden
within
the
proctodeum
compartment
within
the
cloaca
just
inside
the
vent
the
digestive
system
of
birds
is
unique
with
a
crop
for
storage
and
a
gizzard
that
contains
swallowed
stones
for
grinding
food
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
teeth
most
birds
are
highly
adapted
for
rapid
digestion
to
aid
with
flight
some
migratory
birds
have
adapted
to
use
protein
from
many
parts
of
their
bodies
including
protein
from
the
intestines
as
additional
energy
during
migration
birds
have
one
of
the
most
complex
respiratory
systems
of
all
animal
groups
upon
inhalation
of
the
fresh
air
bypasses
the
lungs
and
flows
directly
into
a
posterior
air
sac
which
extends
from
the
lungs
and
connects
with
air
spaces
in
the
bones
and
fills
them
with
air
the
other
of
the
air
goes
directly
into
the
lungs
when
the
bird
exhales
the
used
air
flows
out
of
the
lungs
and
the
stored
fresh
air
from
the
posterior
air
sac
is
simultaneously
forced
into
the
lungs
thus
a
bird's
lungs
receive
a
constant
supply
of
fresh
air
during
both
inhalation
and
exhalation
sound
production
is
achieved
using
the
syrinx
a
muscular
chamber
incorporating
multiple
tympanic
membranes
which
diverges
from
the
lower
end
of
the
trachea
the
trachea
being
elongated
in
some
species
increasing
the
volume
of
vocalisations
and
the
perception
of
the
bird's
size
in
birds
the
main
arteries
taking
blood
away
from
the
heart
originate
from
the
right
aortic
arch
or
pharyngeal
arch
unlike
in
the
mammals
where
the
left
aortic
arch
forms
this
part
of
the
aorta
the
postcava
receives
blood
from
the
limbs
via
the
renal
portal
system
unlike
in
mammals
the
circulating
red
blood
cells
in
birds
retain
their
nucleus
the
avian
circulatory
system
is
driven
by
a
four-chambered
myogenic
heart
contained
in
a
fibrous
pericardial
sac
this
pericardial
sac
is
filled
with
a
serous
fluid
for
lubrication
the
heart
itself
is
divided
into
a
right
and
left
half
each
with
an
atrium
and
ventricle
the
atrium
and
ventricles
of
each
side
are
separated
by
atrioventricular
valves
which
prevent
back
flow
from
one
chamber
to
the
next
during
contraction
being
myogenic
the
heart's
pace
is
maintained
by
pacemaker
cells
found
in
the
sinoatrial
node
located
on
the
right
atrium
the
sinoatrial
node
uses
calcium
to
cause
a
depolarising
signal
transduction
pathway
from
the
atrium
through
right
and
left
atrioventricular
bundle
which
communicates
contraction
to
the
ventricles
the
avian
heart
also
consists
of
muscular
arches
that
are
made
up
of
thick
bundles
of
muscular
layers
much
like
a
mammalian
heart
the
avian
heart
is
composed
of
endocardial
myocardial
and
epicardial
layers
the
atrium
walls
tend
to
be
thinner
than
the
ventricle
walls
due
to
the
intense
ventricular
contraction
used
to
pump
oxygenated
blood
throughout
the
body
avian
hearts
are
generally
larger
than
mammalian
hearts
when
compared
to
body
mass
this
adaptation
allows
more
blood
to
be
pumped
to
meet
the
high
metabolic
need
associated
with
flight
birds
have
a
very
efficient
system
for
diffusing
oxygen
into
the
blood
birds
have
a
ten
times
greater
surface
area
to
gas
exchange
volume
than
mammals
as
a
result
birds
have
more
blood
in
their
capillaries
per
unit
of
volume
of
lung
than
a
mammal
the
arteries
are
composed
of
thick
elastic
muscles
to
withstand
the
pressure
of
the
ventricular
constriction
and
become
more
rigid
as
they
move
away
from
the
heart
blood
moves
through
the
arteries
which
undergo
vasoconstriction
and
into
arterioles
which
act
as
a
transportation
system
to
distribute
primarily
oxygen
as
well
as
nutrients
to
all
tissues
of
the
body
as
the
arterioles
move
away
from
the
heart
and
into
individual
organs
and
tissues
they
are
further
divided
to
increase
surface
area
and
slow
blood
flow
blood
travels
through
the
arterioles
and
moves
into
the
capillaries
where
gas
exchange
can
occur
capillaries
are
organized
into
capillary
beds
in
tissues
it
is
here
that
blood
exchanges
oxygen
for
carbon
dioxide
waste
in
the
capillary
beds
blood
flow
is
slowed
to
allow
maximum
diffusion
of
oxygen
into
the
tissues
once
the
blood
has
become
deoxygenated
it
travels
through
venules
then
veins
and
back
to
the
heart
veins
unlike
arteries
are
thin
and
rigid
as
they
do
not
need
to
withstand
extreme
pressure
as
blood
travels
through
the
venules
to
the
veins
a
funneling
occurs
called
vasodilation
bringing
blood
back
to
the
heart
once
the
blood
reaches
the
heart
it
moves
first
into
the
right
atrium
then
the
right
ventricle
to
be
pumped
through
the
lungs
for
further
gas
exchange
of
carbon
dioxide
waste
for
oxygen
oxygenated
blood
then
flows
from
the
lungs
through
the
left
atrium
to
the
left
ventricle
where
it
is
pumped
out
to
the
body
the
nervous
system
is
large
relative
to
the
bird's
size
the
most
developed
part
of
the
brain
is
the
one
that
controls
the
flight-related
functions
while
the
cerebellum
coordinates
movement
and
the
cerebrum
controls
behaviour
patterns
navigation

and
nest
building
most
birds
have
a
poor
sense
of
smell
with
notable
exceptions
including
kiwis
new
world
vultures
and
tubenoses
the
avian
visual
system
is
usually
highly
developed
water
birds
have
special
flexible
lenses
allowing
accommodation
for
vision
in
air
and
water
some
species
also
have
dual
fovea
birds
are
tetrachromatic
possessing
ultraviolet
uv
sensitive
cone
cells
in
the
eye
as
well
as
green
red
and
blue
ones
they
also
have
double
cones
likely
to
mediate
achromatic
vision
many
birds
show
plumage
patterns
in
ultraviolet
that
are
invisible
to
the
human
eye
some
birds
whose
sexes
appear
similar
to
the
naked
eye
are
distinguished
by
the
presence
of
ultraviolet
reflective
patches
on
their
feathers
male
blue
tits
have
an
ultraviolet
reflective
crown
patch
which
is
displayed
in
courtship
by
posturing
and
raising
of
their
nape
feathers
ultraviolet
light
is
also
used
in
foraging—kestrels
have
been
shown
to
search
for
prey
by
detecting
the
uv
reflective
urine
trail
marks
left
on
the
ground
by
rodents
with
the
exception
of
pigeons
and
a
few
other
species
the
eyelids
of
birds
are
not
used
in
blinking
instead
the
eye
is
lubricated
by
the
nictitating
membrane
a
third
eyelid
that
moves
horizontally
the
nictitating
membrane
also
covers
the
eye
and
acts
as
a
contact
lens
in
many
aquatic
birds
the
bird
retina
has
a
fan
shaped
blood
supply
system
called
the
pecten
most
birds
cannot
move
their
eyes
although
there
are
exceptions
such
as
the
great
cormorant
birds
with
eyes
on
the
sides
of
their
heads
have
a
wide
visual
field
while
birds
with
eyes
on
the
front
of
their
heads
such
as
owls
have
binocular
vision
and
can
estimate
the
depth
of
field
the
avian
ear
lacks
external
pinnae
but
is
covered
by
feathers
although
in
some
birds
such
as
the
asio
bubo
and
otus
owls
these
feathers
form
tufts
which
resemble
ears
the
inner
ear
has
a
cochlea
but
it
is
not
spiral
as
in
mammals
a
few
species
are
able
to
use
chemical
defences
against
predators
some
procellariiformes
can
eject
an
unpleasant
stomach
oil
against
an
aggressor
and
some
species
of
pitohuis
from
new
guinea
have
a
powerful
neurotoxin
in
their
skin
and
feathers
a
lack
of
field
observations
limit
our

are
known
to
sometimes
result
in

the
extinct
xenicibis
was
unique
in
having
an
elongate
forelimb
and
massive

which
likely
functioned
in

or
young
birds
have
two
sexes:
either
female
or
male
the
sex
of
birds
is
determined
by
the
z

sex
chromosomes
rather
than
by
the
x

present
in

birds
have
a
w
chromosome
and
a
z

wz
in
nearly
all
species
of
birds
an
individual's
sex
is
determined
at
fertilisation
however
one
recent
study
demonstrated
temperature-dependent
sex
determination
among
the
australian
brushturkey
for
which
higher
temperatures
during
incubation
resulted
in
a
higher
female-to-male
sex
ratio
this
however
was
later
proven
to
not
be
the
case
these
birds
do
not
exhibit
temperature-dependent

determination
but
temperature-dependent

mortality
feathers
are
a
feature
characteristic
of
birds
though
also
present
in
some
dinosaurs
not
currently
considered
to
be
true
birds
they
facilitate
flight
provide
insulation
that
aids
in
thermoregulation
and
are
used
in
display
camouflage
and
signalling
there
are
several
types
of
feathers
each
serving
its
own
set
of
purposes
feathers
are
epidermal
growths
attached
to
the
skin
and
arise
only
in
specific
tracts
of
skin
called
pterylae
the
distribution
pattern
of
these
feather
tracts
pterylosis
is
used
in
taxonomy
and
systematics
the
arrangement
and
appearance
of
feathers
on
the
body
called
plumage
may
vary
within
species
by
age
social
status
and
sex
plumage
is
regularly
moulted
the
standard
plumage
of
a
bird
that
has
moulted
after
breeding
is
known
as
the
non-breeding
plumage
or—in
the
humphrey-parkes
terminology—basic
plumage
breeding
plumages
or
variations
of
the
basic
plumage
are
known
under
the
humphrey-parkes
system
as
alternate
plumages
moulting
is
annual
in
most
species
although
some
may
have
two
moults
a
year
and
large
birds
of
prey
may
moult
only
once
every
few
years
moulting
patterns
vary
across
species
in
passerines
flight
feathers
are
replaced
one
at
a
time
with
the
innermost
primary
being
the
first
when
the
fifth
of
sixth
primary
is
replaced
the
outermost
tertiaries
begin
to
drop
after
the
innermost
tertiaries
are
moulted
the
secondaries
starting
from
the
innermost
begin
to
drop
and
this
proceeds
to
the
outer
feathers
centrifugal
moult
the
greater
primary
coverts
are
moulted
in
synchrony
with
the
primary
that
they
overlap
a
small
number
of
species
such
as
ducks
and
geese
lose
all
of
their
flight
feathers
at
once
temporarily
becoming
flightless
as
a
general
rule
the
tail
feathers
are
moulted
and
replaced
starting
with
the
innermost
pair
centripetal
moults
of
tail
feathers
are
however
seen
in
the
phasianidae
the
centrifugal
moult
is
modified
in
the
tail
feathers
of
woodpeckers
and
treecreepers
in
that
it
begins
with
the
second
innermost
pair
of
feathers
and
finishes
with
the
central
pair
of
feathers
so
that
the
bird
maintains
a
functional
climbing
tail
the
general
pattern
seen
in
passerines
is
that
the
primaries
are
replaced
outward
secondaries
inward
and
the
tail
from
centre
outward
before
nesting
the
females
of
most
bird
species
gain
a
bare
brood
patch
by
losing
feathers
close
to
the
belly
the
skin
there
is
well
supplied
with
blood
vessels
and
helps
the
bird
in
incubation
feathers
require
maintenance
and
birds
preen
or
groom
them
daily
spending
an
average
of
around
of
their
daily
time
on
this
the
bill
is
used
to
brush
away
foreign
particles
and
to
apply
waxy
secretions
from
the
uropygial
gland
these
secretions
protect
the
feathers'
flexibility
and
act
as
an
antimicrobial
agent
inhibiting
the
growth
of
feather-degrading
bacteria
this
may
be
supplemented
with
the
secretions
of
formic
acid
from
ants
which
birds
receive
through
a
behaviour
known
as
anting
to
remove
feather
parasites
the
scales
of
birds
are
composed
of
the
same
keratin
as
beaks
claws
and
spurs
they
are
found
mainly
on
the
toes
and
metatarsus
but
may
be
found
further
up
on
the
ankle
in
some
birds
most
bird
scales
do
not
overlap
significantly
except
in
the
cases
of
kingfishers
and
woodpeckers
the
scales
of
birds
are
thought
to
be
homologous
to
those
of
reptiles
and
mammals
most
birds
can
fly
which
distinguishes
them
from
almost
all
other
vertebrate
classes
flight
is
the
primary
means
of
locomotion
for
most
bird
species
and
is
used
for
searching
for
food
and
for
escaping
from
predators
birds
have
various
adaptations
for
flight
including
a
lightweight
skeleton
two
large
flight
muscles
the
pectoralis
which
accounts
for
of
the
total
mass
of
the
bird
and
the
supracoracoideus
as
well
as
a
modified
forelimb
wing
that
serves
as
an
aerofoil
wing
shape
and
size
generally
determine
a
bird's
flight
style
and
performance
many
birds
combine
powered
flapping
flight
with
less
energy-intensive
soaring
flight
about
extant
bird
species
are
flightless
as
were
many
extinct
birds
flightlessness
often
arises
in
birds
on
isolated
islands
probably
due
to
limited
resources
and
the
absence
of
land
predators
although
flightless
penguins
use
similar
musculature
and
movements
to
fly
through
the
water
as
do
auks
shearwaters
and
dippers
most
birds
are
diurnal
but
some
birds
such
as
many
species
of
owls
and
nightjars
are
nocturnal
or
crepuscular
active
during
twilight
hours
and
many
coastal
waders
feed
when
the
tides
are
appropriate
by
day
or
night
birds'
diets
are
varied
and
often
include
nectar
fruit
plants
seeds
carrion
and
various
small
animals
including
other
birds
because
birds
have
no
teeth
their
digestive
system
is
adapted
to
process
unmasticated
food
items
that
are
swallowed
whole
birds
that
employ
many
strategies
to
obtain
food
or
feed
on
a
variety
of

items
are
called
generalists
while
others
that
concentrate
time
and
effort
on
specific
food
items
or

are
considered
specialists
birds'
feeding
strategies
vary
by
species
many
birds
glean
for
insects
invertebrates
fruit
or
seeds
some
hunt
insects
by
suddenly
attacking
from
a
branch
those
species
that
seek

insects
are
considered

has
been
recalibrated
and
the

have
seen
much
debate
and
progress
concerning
the
theoretical
underpinnings
of
systematization
itself
partly
through
the
new
concept
of
cladistics
though
field
work
gradually
made
simpson's
classification
outdated
it
remains
the
closest
thing
to
an
official
classification
of
mammals
most
mammals
including
the
six
most
species-rich

belong
to
the

the
three
largest

in
numbers
of
species
are
rodentia:

porcupines
beavers
capybaras
and

the

mammalia
coined
by

in
derived
from
the
latin
mamma
teat
pap
in
an
influential
paper
timothy
rowe
defined
mammalia
phylogenetically
as
the

group
of

the

consisting
of
the
most
recent
common

of
living
monotremes
echidnas

and
therian
mammals
marsupials
and
placentals
and
all
descendants
of
that
ancestor
since
this
ancestor
lived
in
the
jurassic
period
rowe's
definition
excludes
all
animals
from
the
earlier
triassic
despite
the
fact
that
triassic
fossils
in
the
haramiyida
have
been
referred
to
the
mammalia
since
the
mid-th
century
if
mammalia
is
considered
as
the
crown
group
its
origin
can
be
roughly
dated
as
the
first
known
appearance
of
animals
more
closely
related
to
some
extant
mammals
than
to
others
ambondro
is
more
closely
related
to
monotremes
than
to
therian
mammals
while
amphilestes
and
amphitherium
are
more
closely
related
to
the
therians
as
fossils
of
all
three
genera
are
dated
about
million
years
ago
in
the
middle
jurassic
this
is
a
reasonable
estimate
for
the
appearance
of
the
crown
group
t
kemp
has
provided
a
more
traditional
definition:
synapsids
that
possess
a
dentary–squamosal
jaw
articulation
and
occlusion
between
upper
and
lower
molars
with
a
transverse
component
to
the
movement
or
equivalently
in
kemp's
view
the
clade
originating
with
the
last
common
ancestor
of
sinoconodon
and
living
mammals
the
earliest
known
synapsid
satisfying
kemp's
definitions
is
tikitherium
dated

crown
group
mammals
evolved

mammaliaforms
during
the
early

the
cladogram
takes
mammalia
to
be
the
crown
group
the
first
fully
terrestrial
vertebrates
were
amniotes
like
their
amphibious
tetrapod
predecessors
they
had
lungs
and
limbs
amniotic
eggs
however
have
internal
membranes
that
allow
the
developing
embryo
to
breathe
but
keep
water
in
hence
amniotes
can
lay
eggs
on
dry
land
while
amphibians
generally
need
to
lay
their
eggs
in
water
the
first
amniotes
apparently
arose
in
the
pennsylvanian
subperiod
of
the
carboniferous
they
descended
from
earlier
reptiliomorph
amphibious
tetrapods
which
lived
on
land
that
was
already
inhabited
by
insects
and
other
invertebrates
as
well
as
ferns
mosses
and
other
plants
within
a
few
million
years
two
important
amniote
lineages
became
distinct:
the
synapsids
which
would
later
include
the
common
ancestor
of
the
mammals
and
the
sauropsids
which
now
include
turtles
lizards
snakes
crocodilians
dinosaurs
and
birds
synapsids
have
a
single
hole
temporal
fenestra
low
on
each
side
of
the
skull
one
synapsid
group
the
pelycosaurs
included
the
largest
and
fiercest
animals
of
the
early
permian
nonmammalian
synapsids
are
sometimes
called
mammal-like
reptiles
therapsids
a
group
of
synapsids
descended
from
pelycosaurs
in
the
middle
permian
about
million
years
ago
and
became
the
dominant
land
vertebrates
they
differ
from
basal
eupelycosaurs
in
several
features
of
the
skull
and
jaws
including:
larger
skulls
and
incisors
which
are
equal
in
size
in
therapsids
but
not
for
eupelycosaurs
the
therapsid
lineage
leading
to
mammals
went
through
a
series
of
stages
beginning
with
animals
that
were
very
similar
to
their
pelycosaur
ancestors
and
ending
with
probainognathian
cynodonts
some
of
which
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
mammals
those
stages
were
characterized
by:
the
gradual
development
of
a
bony
secondary
palate
progression
towards
an
erect
limb
posture
which
would
increase
the
animals'
stamina
by
avoiding
carrier's
constraint
but
this
process
was
slow
and
erratic:
for
example
all
herbivorous
nonmammaliaform
therapsids
retained
sprawling
limbs
some
late
forms
may
have
had
semierect
hind
limbs
permian
carnivorous
therapsids
had
sprawling
forelimbs
and
some
late
permian
ones
also
had
semisprawling
hindlimbs
in
fact
modern
monotremes
still
have
semisprawling
limbs
the
dentary
gradually
became
the
main
bone
of
the
lower
jaw
which
by
the
triassic
progressed
towards
the
fully
mammalian
jaw
the
lower
consisting
only
of
the
dentary
and
middle
ear
which
is
constructed
by
the
bones
that
were
previously
used
to
construct
the
jaws
of
reptiles
the
permian–triassic
extinction
event
about
million
years
ago
which
was
a
prolonged
event
due
to
the
accumulation
of
the
word
bacteria
is
the
plural
of
the
new
latin
bacterium
which
is
the
latinisation
of
the
greek
βακτήριον
bakterion
the
diminutive
of
βακτηρία
bakteria
meaning
staff
cane
because
the
first
ones
to
be
discovered
were
rod-shaped
the
ancestors
of
modern
bacteria
were
unicellular
microorganisms
that
were
the
first
forms
of
life
to
appear
on
earth
about
billion
years
ago
for
about
billion
years
most
organisms
were
microscopic
and
bacteria
and
archaea
were
the
dominant
forms
of
life
although
bacterial
fossils
exist
such
as
stromatolites
their
lack
of
distinctive
morphology
prevents
them
from
being
used
to
examine
the
history
of
bacterial
evolution
or
to
date
the
time
of
origin
of
a
particular
bacterial
species
however
gene
sequences
can
be
used
to
reconstruct
the
bacterial
phylogeny
and
these
studies
indicate
that
bacteria
diverged
first
from
the
archaeal/eukaryotic
lineage
the
most
recent
common
ancestor
of
bacteria
and
archaea
was
probably
a
hyperthermophile
that
lived
about
billion–
billion
years
ago
bacteria
were
also
involved
in
the
second
great
evolutionary
divergence
that
of
the
archaea
and
eukaryotes
here
eukaryotes
resulted
from
the
entering
of
ancient
bacteria
into
endosymbiotic
associations
with
the
ancestors
of
eukaryotic
cells
which
were
themselves
possibly
related
to
the
archaea
this
involved
the
engulfment
by
proto-eukaryotic
cells
of
alphaproteobacterial
symbionts
to
form
either
mitochondria
or
hydrogenosomes
which
are
still
found
in
all
known
eukarya
sometimes
in
highly
reduced
form
e
g
in
ancient
amitochondrial
protozoa
later
some
eukaryotes
that
already
contained
mitochondria
also
engulfed
cyanobacteria-like
organisms
leading
to
the
formation
of
chloroplasts
in
algae
and
plants
this
is
known
as
secondary
endosymbiosis
bacteria
display
a
wide
diversity
of
shapes
and
sizes
called
morphologies
bacterial
cells
are
about
one-tenth
the
size
of
eukaryotic
cells
and
are
typically
–
micrometres
in
length
however
a
few
species
are
visible
to
the
unaided
eye—for
example
thiomargarita
namibiensis
is
up
to
half
a
millimetre
long
and
epulopiscium
fishelsoni
reaches
mm
among
the
smallest
bacteria
are
members
of
the
genus
mycoplasma
which
measure
only
micrometres
as
small
as
the
largest
viruses
some
bacteria
may
be
even
smaller
but
these
ultramicrobacteria
are
not
well-studied
most
bacterial
species
are
either
spherical
called
cocci
sing
coccus
from
greek
kókkos
grain
seed
or
rod-shaped
called
bacilli
sing
bacillus
from
latin
baculus
stick
some
bacteria
called
vibrio
are
shaped
like
slightly
curved
rods
or
comma-shaped
others
can
be
spiral-shaped
called
spirilla
or
tightly
coiled
called
spirochaetes
a
small
number
of
other
unusual
shapes
have
been
described
such
as
star-shaped
bacteria
this
wide
variety
of
shapes
is
determined
by
the
bacterial
cell
wall
and
cytoskeleton
and
is
important
because
it
can
influence
the

before
the
introduction
of
molecular

taxonomists
considered
fungi
to
be
members
of
the
plant
kingdom
because
of
similarities
in
lifestyle:
both
fungi
and
plants
are
mainly
immobile
and
have
similarities
in
general
morphology
and
growth
habitat
like

fungi
often
grow
in

and
in
the
case
of
mushrooms
form
conspicuous
fruit
bodies
which
sometimes
resemble
plants
such
as
mosses
the
fungi
are
now
considered
a
separate
kingdom
distinct
from
both
plants
and
animals
from
which
they
appear
to
have
diverged
around
one
billion
years
ago
around
the
start
of
the
neoproterozoic
era
some
morphological
biochemical
and
genetic
features
are
shared
with

organisms
while
others
are
unique
to
the
fungi
clearly
separating
them
from
the
other
kingdoms:

eukaryotes:
fungal
cells
contain
membrane-bound
nuclei
with
chromosomes
that
contain
dna
with
noncoding
regions
called
introns
and

regions
called

fungi
have
membrane-bound
cytoplasmic
organelles

glycogen
which
is
also
found
in
animals
with
animals:
fungi
lack
chloroplasts
and
are
heterotrophic
organisms
and
so
require
preformed
organic
compounds

the

which
referred
to
an
earlier
set
of
practices
that
encompassed
elements
of

metallurgy
philosophy
astrology
astronomy
mysticism
and

it
is
often
seen
as
linked
to
the
quest
to
turn

another
common
starting
material
into

though
in
ancient
times
the
study
encompassed
many
of

greek-egyptian
alchemist
zosimos
an
alchemist
was
called
a
'chemist'
in
popular
speech
and
later
the
suffix
-ry
was
added
to
this
to
describe
the
art
of
the

as

the
modern
word
alchemy
in
turn
is
derived
from
the
arabic
word
al-kīmīā
الكیمیاء
in
origin
the
term
is
borrowed
from
the
greek
χημία
or
χημεία
this
may
have
egyptian
origins
since
al-kīmīā
is
derived
from
the
greek

which
is
in

derived
from
the
word
kemet
which
is
the
ancient
name
of

in

language
alternately
al-kīmīā
may
derive
from

traditional
chemistry
starts
with
the

and
other
aggregates
of

this

can
be
studied
in
solid

states
in
isolation
or
in

the
interactions
reactions

transformations
that
are
studied
in

are
usually
the
result
of
interactions
between
atoms
leading
to
rearrangements
of
the
chemical

which
hold
atoms
together
such
behaviors
are
studied
in
a

a
transformation
of
some
substances
into
one
or
more
different
substances
the
basis
of
such
a
chemical
transformation
is
the
rearrangement
of
electrons
in
the
chemical
bonds
between
atoms
it
can
be
symbolically
depicted
through
a
chemical
equation
which
usually
involves
atoms
as
subjects
the
number
of
atoms
on
the
left
and
the
right
in
the
equation
for
a
chemical
transformation
is
equal
when
the
number
of
atoms
on
either
side
is
unequal
the
transformation
is
referred
to
as
a
nuclear
reaction
or
radioactive
decay
the
type
of
chemical
reactions
a
substance
may
undergo
and
the
energy
changes
that
may
accompany
it
are
constrained
by
certain
basic
rules
known
as
chemical
laws
energy
and
entropy
considerations
are
invariably
important
in
almost
all
chemical
studies
chemical
substances
are
classified
in
terms
of
their
structure
phase
as
well
as
their
chemical
compositions
they
can
be
analyzed
using
the
tools
of
chemical
analysis
e
g
spectroscopy
and
chromatography
scientists
engaged
in
chemical
research
are
known
as
chemists
most
chemists
specialize
in
one
or
more
sub-disciplines
several
concepts
are
essential
for
the
study
of
chemistry
some
of
them
are:
in
chemistry
matter
is
defined
as
anything
that
has
rest
mass
and
volume
it
takes
up
space
and
is
made
up
of
particles
the
particles
that
make
up
matter
have
rest
mass
as
well
–
not
all
particles
have
rest
mass
such
as
the
photon
matter
can
be
a
pure
chemical
substance
or
a
mixture
of
substances
the
atom
is
the
basic
unit
of
chemistry
it
consists
of
a
dense
core
called
the
atomic
nucleus
surrounded
by
a
space
occupied
by
an
electron
cloud
the
nucleus
is
made
up
of
positively
charged
protons
and
uncharged
neutrons
together
called
nucleons
while
the
electron
cloud
consists
of
negatively
charged
electrons
which
orbit
the
nucleus
in
a
neutral
atom
the
negatively
charged
electrons
balance
out
the
positive
charge
of
the
protons
the
nucleus
is
dense
the
mass
of
a
nucleon
is
appromixately
times
that
of
an
electron
yet
the
radius
of
an
atom
is
about
times
that
of
its
nucleus
the
atom
is
also
the
smallest
entity
that
can
be
envisaged
to
retain
the
chemical
properties
of
the

a
chemical
element
is
a
pure
substance
which
is
composed
of
a
single
type
of
atom
characterized
by
its
particular
number
of
protons
in
the
nuclei
of
its
atoms
known
as
the
atomic
number
and
represented
by
the
symbol
z
the
mass
number
is
the
sum
of
the
number
of
protons
and
neutrons
in
a
nucleus
although
all
the
nuclei
of
all
atoms
belonging
to
one
element
will
have
the
same
atomic
number
they
may
not
necessarily
have
the
same
mass
number
atoms
of
an
element
which
have
different
mass
numbers
are
known
as
isotopes
for
example
all
atoms
with
protons
in
their
nuclei
are
atoms
of
the
chemical
element
carbon
but
atoms
of
carbon
may
have
mass
numbers
of
or
the
standard
presentation
of
the
chemical
elements
is
in
the
periodic
table
which
orders
elements
by
atomic
number
the
periodic
table
is
arranged
in
groups
or
columns
and
periods
or
rows
the
periodic
table
is
useful
in
identifying
periodic
trends
a
compound
is
a
pure
chemical
substance
composed
of
more
than
one
element
the
properties
of
a
compound
bear
little
similarity
to
those
of
its
elements
the
standard
nomenclature
of
compounds
is
set
by
the
international
union
of
pure
and
applied
chemistry
iupac
organic
compounds
are
named
according
to
the
organic
nomenclature
system
the
names
for
inorganic
compounds
are
created
according
to
the
inorganic
nomenclature
system
when
a
compound
has
more
than
one
component
then
they
are
divided
into
two
classes
the
electropositive
and
the
electronegative
components
in
addition
the
chemical
abstracts
service
has
devised
a
method
to
index
chemical
substances
in
this
scheme
each
chemical
substance
is
identifiable
by
a
number
known
as
its
cas
registry
number
a
molecule
is
the
smallest
indivisible
portion
of
a
pure
chemical
substance
that
has
its
unique
set
of
chemical
properties
that
is
its
potential
to
undergo
a
certain
set
of
chemical
reactions
with
other
substances
however
this
definition
only
works

the
sumerians
ancient

civilization
had
a
predictive
knowledge
and
a
basic
understanding
of
the
motions
of
the
sun

and
stars
the
stars
and
planets
were
often
worshipped
believed
to
represent
gods
while
the
explanations
for
the
observed
positions
of
the
stars
were
often
unscientific
and
lacking
in
evidence
these
early
observations
laid
the
foundation
for
later
astronomy
as
the
stars
were
found
to
traverse
great
circles
across
the
sky
which
however
did
not
explain
the
positions
of
the
planets
according
to
asger
aaboe
the
origins
of
western
astronomy
can
be
found
in
mesopotamia
and
all
western
efforts
in
the
exact
sciences
are
descended
from
late
babylonian
astronomy
egyptian
astronomers
left
monuments
showing
knowledge
of

of
the
celestial
bodies
while
greek
poet
homer
wrote
of
various
celestial
objects
in
his
iliad

later
greek
astronomers
provided
names
which
are
still
used
today
for

natural
philosophy
has
its
origins
in
greece
during
the
archaic
period
bce
–
bce
when
pre-socratic
philosophers
like
thales
rejected
non-naturalistic
explanations
for
natural
phenomena
and
proclaimed
that
every
event
had
a
natural
cause
they
proposed
ideas
verified
by
reason
and
observation
and
many
of
their
hypotheses
proved
successful
in

atomism
was
found
to
be
correct
approximately
years
after
it
was
proposed
by
leucippus
and
his
pupil

the
western
roman

fell
in

this
resulted
in
a
decline
in
intellectual
pursuits
in
the
western

of
europe
by
contrast
the
eastern
roman
empire
also
known
as
the
byzantine

resisted
the

and
continued
to
advance
various
fields
of

john
philoponus
a
byzantine
scholar
questioned
aristotle's
teaching
of
physics
and
noting
its
flaws
he
introduced
the
theory
of
impetus
aristotle's
physics
was
not
scrutinized
until
john
philoponus
appeared
and
unlike
aristotle
who
based
his
physics
on
verbal
argument
philoponus
relied
on
observation
on
aristotle's
physics
john
philoponus
wrote:
“but
this
is
completely
erroneous
and
our
view
may
be
corroborated
by
actual
observation
more
effectively
than
by
any
sort
of
verbal
argument
for
if
you
let
fall
from
the
same
height
two
weights
of
which
one
is
many
times
as
heavy
as
the
other
you
will
see
that
the
ratio
of
the
times
required
for
the
motion
does
not
depend
on
the
ratio
of
the
weights
but
that
the
difference
in
time
is
a
very
small
one
and
so
if
the
difference
in
the
weights
is
not
considerable
that
is
of
one
is
let
us
say
double
the
other
there
will
be
no
difference
or
else
an
imperceptible
difference
in
time
though
the
difference
in
weight
is
by
no
means
negligible
with
one
body
weighing
twice
as
much
as
the
other”john
philoponus'
criticism
of
aristotelian
principles
of
physics
served
as
an
inspiration
for
galileo
galilei
ten
centuries
later
during
the
scientific
revolution
galileo
cited
philoponus
substantially
in
his
works
when
arguing
that
aristotelian
physics
was
flawed
in
the
jean
buridan
a
teacher
in
the
faculty
of

at
the
university
of
paris
developed
the
concept
of
impetus
it
was
a
step
toward
the
modern
ideas
of
inertia
and
momentum
islamic
scholarship
inherited
aristotelian
physics
from
the
greeks
and
during
the
islamic
golden
age
developed
it
further
especially
placing
emphasis
on
observation
and
a
priori
reasoning
developing
early
forms
of
the
scientific
method
the
most
notable
innovations
were
in
the
field
of
optics
and
vision
which
came
from
the
works
of
many
scientists
like
ibn
sahl
al-kindi
ibn
al-haytham
al-farisi
and
avicenna
the
most
notable
work
was
the
book
of
optics
also
known
as
kitāb
al-manāẓir
written
by
ibn
al-haytham
in
which
he
conclusively
disproved
the
ancient
greek
idea
about
vision
but
also
came
up
with
a
new
theory
in
the
book
he
presented
a
study
of
the
phenomenon
of
the
camera
obscura
his
thousand-year-old
version
of
the
pinhole
camera
and
delved
further
into
the
way
the
eye
itself
works
using
dissections
and
the
knowledge
of
previous
scholars
he
was
able
to
begin
to
explain
how
light
enters
the
eye
he
asserted
that
the
light
ray
is
focused
but
the
actual
explanation
of
how
light
projected
to
the
back
of
the
eye
had
to
wait
until
his
treatise
on
light
explained
the
camera
obscura
hundreds
of
years
before
the
modern
development
of
photography
the
seven-volume
book
of
optics
kitab
al-manathir
hugely
influenced
thinking
across
disciplines
from
the
theory
of
visual
perception
to
the
nature
of
perspective
in
medieval
art
in
both
the
east
and
the
west
for
more
than
years
many
later
european
scholars
and
fellow
polymaths
from
robert
grosseteste
and
leonardo
da
vinci
to
rené
descartes
johannes
kepler
and
isaac
newton
were
in
his
debt
indeed
the
influence
of
ibn
al-haytham's
optics
ranks
alongside
that
of
newton's
work
of
the
same
title
published
years
later
the
translation
of
the
book
of
optics
had
a
huge
impact
on
europe
from
it
later
european
scholars
were
able
to
build
devices
that
replicated
those
ibn
al-haytham
had
built
and
understand
the
way
light
works
from
this
such
important
things
as
eyeglasses
magnifying
glasses
telescopes
and
cameras
were
developed
physics
became
a
separate
science
when
early
modern
europeans
used
experimental
and
quantitative
methods
to
discover
what
are
now
considered
to
be
the
laws
of
physics
major
developments
in
this
period
include
the
replacement
of
the
geocentric
model
of
the
solar
system
with
the
heliocentric
copernican
model
the
laws
governing
the
motion
of
planetary
bodies
determined
by
johannes
kepler
between
and
pioneering
work
on
telescopes
and
observational
astronomy
by
galileo
galilei
in
the
th
and
th
centuries
and
isaac
newton's
discovery
and
unification
of
the
laws
of
motion
and
universal
gravitation
that
would
come
to
bear
his
name
newton
also
developed
calculus
the
mathematical
study
of
change
which
provided
new
mathematical
methods
for
solving
physical
problems
the
discovery
of
new
laws
in
thermodynamics
chemistry
and
electromagnetics
resulted
from
greater
research
efforts
during
the
industrial
revolution
as
energy
needs
increased
the
laws
comprising
classical
physics
remain
very
widely
used
for
objects
on
everyday
scales
travelling
at
non-relativistic
speeds
since
they
provide
a
very
close
approximation
in
such
situations
and
theories
such
as
quantum
mechanics
and
the
theory
of
relativity
simplify
to
their
classical
equivalents
at
such
scales
however
inaccuracies
in
classical
mechanics
for
very
small
objects
and
very
high
velocities
led
to
the
development
of
modern
physics
in
the
th
century
modern
physics
began
in
the
early
th
century
with
the
work
of
max
planck
in
quantum
theory
and
albert
einstein's
theory
of
relativity
both
of
these
theories
came
about
due
to
inaccuracies
in
classical
mechanics
in
certain
situations
classical
mechanics
predicted
a
varying
speed
of
light
which
could
not
be
resolved
with
the
constant
speed
predicted
by
maxwell's
equations
of
electromagnetism
this
discrepancy
was
corrected
by
einstein's
theory
of
special
relativity
which
replaced
classical
mechanics
for
fast-moving
bodies
and
allowed
for
a
constant
speed
of
light
black
body
radiation
provided
another
problem
for
classical
physics
which
was
corrected
when
planck
proposed
that
the
excitation
of
material
oscillators
is
possible
only
in
discrete
steps
proportional
to
their
frequency
this
along
with
the
photoelectric
effect
and
a
complete
theory
predicting
discrete
energy
levels
of
electron
orbitals
led
to
the
theory
of
quantum
mechanics
taking
over
from
classical
physics
at
very
small
scales
quantum
mechanics
would
come
to
be
pioneered
by
werner
heisenberg
erwin
schrödinger
and
paul
dirac
from
this
early
work
and
work
in
related
fields
the
standard
model
of
particle
physics
was
derived
following
the
discovery
of
a
particle
with
properties
consistent
with
the
higgs
boson
at
cern
in
all
fundamental
particles
predicted
by
the
standard
model
and
no
others
appear
to
exist
however
physics
beyond
the
standard
model
with
theories
such
as
supersymmetry
is
an
active
area
of
research
areas
of
mathematics
in
general
are
important
to
this
field
such
as
the
study
of
probabilities
and
groups
in
many
ways
physics
stems
from
ancient
greek

an
early
book
on
physics
which
attempted
to
analyze
and
define
motion
from
a
philosophical
point
of
view
various
greek
philosophers
advanced
their
own
theories
of
nature
physics
was
known
as
natural
philosophy
until
the
late
th
century
by
the
th
century
physics
was
realised
as
a
discipline
distinct
from
philosophy
and
the
other
sciences
physics
as
with
the
rest
of
science
relies
on
philosophy
of
science
and
its
scientific
method
to
advance
our
knowledge
of
the
physical
world
the
scientific
method
employs
a
priori
reasoning
as
well
as
a
posteriori
reasoning
and
the
use
of
bayesian
inference
to
measure
the
validity
of
a
given
theory
the
development
of
physics
has
answered
many
questions
of
early
philosophers
but
has
also
raised
new
questions
study
of
the
philosophical
issues
surrounding
physics
the
philosophy
of
physics
involves
issues
such
as
the
nature
of
space
and
time
determinism
and
metaphysical
outlooks
such
as
empiricism
naturalism
and
realism
many
physicists
have
written
about
the
philosophical
implications
of
their
work
for
instance
laplace
who
championed
causal
determinism
and
erwin
schrödinger
who
wrote
on
quantum
mechanics
the
mathematical
physicist
roger
penrose
had
been
called
a
platonist
by
stephen
hawking
a
view
penrose
discusses
in
his
book
the
road
to
reality
hawking
referred
to
himself
as
an
unashamed
reductionist
and
took
issue
with
penrose's
views
though
physics
deals
with
a
wide
variety
of
systems
certain
theories
are
used
by
all
physicists
each
of
these
theories
were
experimentally
tested
numerous
times
and
found
to
be
an
adequate
approximation
of
nature
for
instance
the
theory
of
classical
mechanics
accurately
describes
the
motion
of
objects
provided
they
are
much
larger
than
atoms
and
moving
at
much
less
than
the
speed
of
light
these
theories
continue
to
be
areas
of
active
research
today
chaos

a
remarkable
aspect
of
classical

was
discovered
in
the
th

three
centuries
after
the
original
formulation
of

by
isaac
newton
–
these
central
theories
are

tools
for

milk
is
fed
to
infants
through
breastfeeding
either
directly
or
by
expressing
the
milk
to
be
stored
and
consumed
later
the
early
milk
from

is
called
colostrum
colostrum
contains

continue
to
consume
milk
beyond
infancy
using
the
milk
of
other
mammals
especially
cattle
goats
and
sheep
as
a
food
product
initially
the
ability
to
digest
milk
was
limited
to
children
as
adults
did
not
produce
lactase
an
enzyme
necessary
for
digesting
the
lactose
in
milk
people
therefore
converted
milk
to
curd
cheese
and
other
products
to
reduce
the
levels
of
lactose
thousands
of
years
ago
a
chance
mutation
spread
in
human
populations
in
europe
that
enabled
the
production
of
lactase
in
adulthood
this
mutation
allowed
milk
to
be
used
as
a
new
source
of
nutrition
which
could
sustain
populations
when
other
food
sources
failed
people
process
milk
into
a

the
most
studied
chemical
compound

is
described
as
the

for
its

dissolve
many
substances
this

a
liquid
at

that
are
most

specifically
at
a
standard
pressure
of

water
is
a
liquid
between

°c

increasing
the
pressure
slightly
lowers
the
melting
point
which
is
about
−
°c
°f
at
atm
and

at

this
effect
is
relevant
for
example
to

to
the
buried

of
antarctica
and
to
the
movement
of
glaciers
at
pressures
higher

the

rapidly
increases
again
and
ice
takes
several
exotic

that
do
not

has
a
more
dramatic

phenomenon
exploited
in

the

water
also
differs
from
most
liquids
in
that
it
becomes
less

as
it

is

the
density
of

thus
water
expands
in
volume
as
it

which
accounts
for
the
fact
that
ice
floats
on
liquid
water
the
details
of
the
exact
chemical
nature
of
liquid
water
are
not
well
understood
some
theories
suggest
that

unusual

is
as
a

the
history
of
human
rights
has
not
been
entirely
progressive
many
established

by
other
less
tolerant
systems
stable
institutions
may
be
uprooted
such
as
in
cases
of
conflict
such
as
war
and
terrorism
the
earliest
conceptualisation
of
human
rights
is
credited
to
ideas
about
natural
rights
emanating
from
natural
law
the
northeast
african
civilization
of
ancient
egypt
supported
basic
human
rights
for
example
pharaoh
bocchoris
-
bc
promoted
individual
rights
suppressed
imprisonment
for
debt
and
reformed
laws
relating
to
the
transferral
of
property
the
first
recording
of
human
rights
were
inscribed
by
cyrus

is
a
clay
tablet
created
in

soon
after
the
achaemenid
conquest
of
the
neo-babylonian
empire
additionally
it
stated
the
freedom
to
practice
one's
faith
without
persecution
and
forced
conversions
the
mauryan
emperor
ashoka
who
ruled
from
to
bce
established
the
largest
empire
in
south
asia
following
the
reportedly
destructive
kalinga
war
ashoka
adopted
buddhism
and
abandoned
an
expansionist
policy
in
favor
of
humanitarian
reforms
the
edicts
of
ashoka
were
erected
throughout
his
empire
containing
the
'law
of
piety'
these
laws
prohibited
slavery
religious
discrimination
and
cruelty
against
both
humans
and
animals
later
documents
pertaining
to
human

can
be
referenced
in

samuel

suggests
that
the
concept
of
human

is
intertwined
with
the
modern
sense
of
citizenship
which
did
not
emerge
until
the
past
few
hundred
years
th-century
english
philosopher
john
locke
discussed
natural
rights
in
his
work
identifying
them
as
being
life
liberty
and
estate
property
and
argued
that
such
fundamental
rights
could
not
be
surrendered
in
the
social
contract
in
britain
in
the
english
bill
of

and
the
scottish
claim
of

a
range
of

two
major
revolutions
occurred
during

th

leading
to
the
united

declaration
of

and
the
french
declaration
of

number
of
fundamental
civil

we
hold
these
truths
to
be
self-evident
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
these
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
these
were
followed
by
developments
in
philosophy
of
human
rights
by
philosophers
such
as
thomas
paine
john
stuart
mill
and
g
w
f
hegel
during
the
th
and
th
centuries
the
term
human
rights
probably
came
into
use
some
time
between
paine's
the
rights
of
man
and
william
lloyd
garrison's
writings
in
the
liberator
in
which
he
stated
that
he
was
trying
to
enlist
his
readers
in
the
great
cause
of
human
rights
although
the
term
had
been
used
by
at
least
one
author
as
early
as
in
the
th
century
human
rights
became
a
central
concern
over
the
issue
of
slavery
a
number
of
reformers
notably
british
member
of
parliament
william
wilberforce
worked
towards
the
abolition
of
the
atlantic
slave
trade
and
abolition
of
slavery
this
was
achieved
across
the
british
empire
by
the
slave
trade
act
which
was
enforced
internationally
by
the
royal
navy
under
treaties
britain
negotiated
with
other
nations
and
the
slavery
abolition
act
in
the
united
states
all
the
northern
states
had
abolished
the
institution
of
slavery
between
and
although
southern
states
clung
tightly
to
the
peculiar
institution
conflict
and
debates
over
the
expansion
of
slavery
to
new
territories
constituted
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
southern
states'
secession
and
the
american
civil
war
during
the
reconstruction
period
immediately
following
the
war
several
amendments
to
the
united

constitution
were
made
these
included
the
th
amendment
banning
slavery
the
th
amendment
assuring
full
citizenship
and
civil

to
all
people
born
in
the

and
the

the
reformer
tsar
alexander

ended
serfdom
in
although
the
freed
serfs
often
faced
restrictions
of
their
mobility
within
the
nation
many
groups
and
movements
have
achieved
profound
social
changes
over
the
course
of
the
th
century
in
the
name
of
human
rights
in
europe
and
north
america
labour
unions
brought
about
laws
granting
workers
the
right
to
strike
establishing
minimum
work
conditions
and
forbidding

regulating
child
labour
the
women's

movement
succeeded
in
gaining
for
many
women
the
right
to
vote
national
liberation
movements
in
many
countries
succeeded
in
driving
out
colonial
powers
one
of
the
most
influential
was
mahatma
gandhi's
movement
to
free
his
native

movements
by
long-oppressed

and
religious
minorities
succeeded
in
many
parts
of

among
them
the
civil

movement
and
more
recent
movements
on

in
the
perspective
of
the
history
of
art
artistic
works
have
existed
for
almost
as
long
as
humankind:
from
early
pre-historic
art
to
contemporary
art
however
some
theories
restrict
the
concept
of
artistic
works
to
modern
western
societies
one
early
sense
of
the
definition
of
art
is
closely
related
to
the
older
latin
meaning
which
roughly
translates
to
skill
or
craft
as
associated
with
words
such
as
artisan
english
words
derived
from
this
meaning
include
artifact
artificial
artifice
medical
arts
and
military
arts
however
there
are
many
other
colloquial
uses
of
the
word
all
with
some
relation
to
its
etymology
over
time
philosophers
like
plato
aristotle
socrates
and
kant
among
others
questioned
the
meaning
of
art
several
dialogues
in
plato
tackle
questions
about
art:
socrates
says
that
poetry
is
inspired
by
the
muses
and
is
not
rational
he
speaks
approvingly
of
this
and
other
forms
of
divine
madness
drunkenness
eroticism
and
dreaming
in
the
phaedrus
a–c
and
yet
in
the
republic
wants
to
outlaw
homer's
great
poetic
art
and
laughter
as
well
in
ion
socrates
gives
no
hint
of
the
disapproval
of
homer
that
he
expresses
in
the
republic
the
dialogue
ion
suggests
that
homer's
iliad
functioned
in
the
ancient
greek
world
as
the
bible
does
today
in
the
modern
christian
world:
as
divinely
inspired
literary
art
that
can
provide
moral
guidance
if
only
it
can
be
properly
interpreted
with
regards
to
the
literary
art
and
the
musical
arts
aristotle
considered
epic
poetry
tragedy
comedy
dithyrambic
poetry
and
music
to
be
mimetic
or
imitative
art
each
varying
in
imitation
by
medium
object
and
manner
for
example
music
imitates
with
the
media
of
rhythm
and
harmony
whereas
dance
imitates
with
rhythm
alone
and
poetry
with
language
the
forms
also
differ
in
their
object
of
imitation
comedy
for
instance
is
a
dramatic
imitation
of
men
worse
than
average
whereas
tragedy
imitates
men
slightly
better
than
average
lastly
the
forms
differ
in
their
manner
of
imitation—through
narrative
or
character
through
change
or
no
change
and
through
drama
or
no
drama
aristotle
believed
that
imitation
is
natural
to
mankind
and
constitutes
one
of
mankind's
advantages
over
animals
the
second
and
more
recent
sense
of
the
word
art
as
an
abbreviation
for
creative
art
or
fine
art
emerged
in
the
early
th
century
fine
art
refers
to
a
skill
used
to
express
the
artist's
creativity
or
to
engage
the
audience's
aesthetic
sensibilities
or
to
draw
the
audience
towards
consideration
of
more
refined
or
finer
work
of
art
within
this
latter
sense
the
word
art
may
refer
to
several
things:
i
a
study
of
a
creative
skill
ii
a
process
of
using
the
creative
skill
iii
a
product
of
the
creative
skill
or
iv
the
audience's
experience
with
the
creative
skill
the
creative
arts
art
as
discipline
are
a
collection
of
disciplines
which
produce
artworks
art
as
objects
that
are
compelled
by
a
personal
drive
art
as
activity
and
convey
a
message
mood
or
symbolism
for
the
perceiver
to
interpret
art
as
experience
art
is
something
that
stimulates
an
individual's
thoughts
emotions
beliefs
or
ideas
through
the
senses
works
of
art
can
be
explicitly
made
for
this
purpose
or
interpreted
on
the
basis
of
images
or
objects
for
some
scholars
such

the

the

as

if

some

have
argued
that
the
difference
between
fine
art
and
applied
art
has
more
to
do
with
value
judgments
made
about
the
art
than
any
clear
definitional
difference
however
even
fine
art
often
has
goals
beyond
pure
creativity
and
self-expression
the
purpose
of
works
of
art
may
be
to
communicate
ideas
such
as
in
politically
spiritually
or
philosophically
motivated
art
to
create
a
sense
of
beauty
see
aesthetics
to
explore
the
nature
of
perception
for
pleasure
or
to
generate
strong
emotions
the
purpose
may
also
be
seemingly
nonexistent
the
nature
of
art
has
been
described
by
philosopher
richard
wollheim
as
one
of
the
most
elusive
of
the
traditional
problems
of
human
culture
art
has
been
defined
as
a
vehicle
for
first
used
in
english
in
the
word
parasite
comes
from
the
medieval
french
parasite
from
the
latin
parasitus
the
latinisation
of
the
greek
παράσιτος
parasitos
one
who
eats
at
the
table
of
another
and
that
from
παρά
para
beside
by
σῖτος
sitos
wheat
hence
food
the
related
term
parasitism
appears
in
english
from
parasitism
is
a
kind
of
symbiosis
a
close
and
persistent
long-term
biological
interaction
between
the
parasite
and
its
host
unlike
commensalism
and
mutualism
the
parasitic
relationship
harms
the
host
either
feeding
on
it
or
as
in
the
case
of
intestinal
parasites
consuming
some
of
its
food
because
parasites
interact
with
other
species
they
are
well
placed
to
act
as
vectors
of
pathogens
microscopic
parasites
that
cause
disease
predation
is
not
generally
considered
a
symbiosis
as
the
interaction
is
brief
but
the
entomologist
e
o
wilson
has
characterised
parasites
as
predators
that
eat
prey
in
units
of
less
than
one
within
that
scope
are
many
possible
ways
of
life
parasites
are
classified
in
a
variety
of
different
but
overlapping
schemes
based
on
their
interactions
with
their
hosts
and
on
their
life
cycles
which
are
sometimes
very
complex
an
obligate
parasite
is
totally
dependent
on
the
host
to
complete
its
life
cycle
while
a
facultative
parasite
is
not
parasite
life
cycles
involving
only
one
host
are
called
direct
those
with
a
definitive
host
where
the
parasite
reproduces
sexually
and
at
least
one
intermediate
host
are
called
indirect
an
endoparasite
is
one
that
lives
inside
the
host's
body
an
ectoparasite
lives
outside
on
the
host's
surface
mesoparasites
like
some
copepods
enter
an
opening
in
the
host's
body
and
remain
partly
embedded
there
it
is
possible
for
parasites
to
be
generalists
feeding
on
a
wide
range
of
hosts
but
many
parasites
and
the
majority
of
protozoans
and
helminths
that
parasitise
animals
are
specialists
and
extremely
host-specific
an
early
basic
functional
division
of
parasites
was
that
of
microparasites
and
macroparasites
these
each
had
a
mathematical
model
assigned
in
order
to
analyse
the
population
movements
of
the
host–parasite
groupings
the
microorganisms
and
viruses
that
can
reproduce
and
complete
their
life
cycle
within
the
host
are
known
as
microparasites
macroparasites
are
the
multicellular
organisms
that
reproduce
and
complete
their
life
cycle
outside
of
the
host
or
on
the
host's
body
much
of
the
thinking
on
types
of
parasitism
has
focussed
on
terrestrial
animal
parasites
of
animals
such
as
helminths
those
in
other
environments
and
with
other
hosts
often
have
analogous
strategies
for
example
the
snubnosed
eel
is
probably
a
facultative
endoparasite
that
opportunistically
burrows
into
and
eats
sick
and
dying
fish
plant-eating
insects
such
as
scale
insects
aphids
and
caterpillars
are
much
like
ectoparasites
attacking
much
larger
plants
they
serve
as
vectors
of
bacteria
fungi
and
viruses
which
cause
plant
diseases
as
female
scale
insects
are
unable
to
move
they
are
obligate
parasites
permanently
attached
to
their
hosts
there
are
six
major
parasitic
strategies
namely
parasitic
castration
directly
transmitted
parasitism
trophically
transmitted
parasitism
vector-transmitted
parasitism
parasitoidism
and
micropredation
these
apply
to
parasites
whose
hosts
are
plants
as
well
as
animals
these
strategies
represent
adaptive
peaks
intermediate
strategies
are
possible
but
organisms
in
many
different
groups
have
consistently
converged
on
these
six
which
are
evolutionarily
stable
a
perspective
on
the
evolutionary
options
can
be
gained
by
considering
four
questions:
the
effect
on
the
fitness
of
a
parasite's
hosts
the
number
of
hosts
they
have
per
life
stage
whether
the
host
is
prevented
from
reproducing
and
whether
the
effect
depends
on
intensity
number
of
parasites
per
host
from
this
analysis
the
major
evolutionary
strategies
of
parasitism
emerge
alongside
predation
parasitic
castrators
partly
or
completely
destroy
their
host's
ability
to
reproduce
diverting
the
energy
that
would
have
gone
into
reproduction
into
host
and
parasite
growth
sometimes
causing
gigantism
in
the
host
the
host's
other
systems
are
left
intact
allowing
it
to
survive
and
sustain
the
parasite
parasitic
crustaceans
such
as
those
in
the
specialised
barnacle
genus
sacculina
specifically
cause
damage
to
the
gonads
of
their
many
species
of
host
crabs
in
the
case
of
sacculina
the
testes
of
over
two-thirds
of
their
crab
hosts
degenerate
sufficiently
for
these
male
crabs
to
have
gained
female
secondary
sex
characteristics
such
as
broader
abdomens
smaller
claws
and
egg-grasping
appendages
various
species
of
helminth
castrate
their
hosts
such
as
insects
and
snails
this
may
be
directly
whether
mechanically
by
feeding
on
their
gonads
or
by
secreting
a
chemical
that
destroys
reproductive
cells
or
indirectly
whether
by
secreting
a
hormone
or
by
diverting
nutrients
for
example
the
trematode
zoogonus
lasius
whose
sporocysts
lack
mouths
castrates
the
intertidal
marine
snail
tritia
obsoleta
chemically
developing
in
its
gonad
and
killing
its
reproductive
cells
directly
transmitted
parasites
not
requiring
a
vector
to
reach
their
hosts
include
parasites
of
terrestrial
vertebrates
such
as
lice
and
mites
marine
parasites
such
as
copepods
and
cyamid
amphipods
monogeneans
and
many
species
of
nematodes
fungi
protozoans
bacteria
and
viruses
whether
endoparasites
or
ectoparasites
each
has
a
single
host
species
within
that
species
most
individuals
are
free
or
almost
free
of
parasites
while
a
minority
carry
a
large
number
of
parasites
this
highly
uneven
distribution
is
described
as
aggregated
trophically
transmitted
parasites
are
transmitted
by
being
eaten
by
a
host
they
include
trematodes
all
except
schistosomes
cestodes
acanthocephalans
pentastomids
many
round
worms
and
many
protozoa
such
as
toxoplasma
they
have
complex
life
cycles
involving
hosts
of
two
or
more
species
in
their
juvenile
stages
they
infect
and
often
encyst
in
the
intermediate
host
when
this
animal
is
eaten
by
a
predator
the
definitive
host
the
parasite
survives
the
digestion
process
and
matures
into
an
adult
some
live
as
intestinal
parasites
many
trophically
transmitted
parasites
modify
the
behaviour
of
their
intermediate
hosts
increasing
their
chances
of
being
eaten
by
a
predator
like
directly
transmitted
parasites
the
distribution
of
trophically
transmitted
parasites
among
host
individuals
is
aggregated
coinfection
by
multiple
parasites
is
common
autoinfection
where
by
exception
the
whole
of
the
parasite's
life
cycle
takes
place
in
a
single
primary
host
can
sometimes
occur
in
helminths
such
as
strongyloides
stercoralis
vector-transmitted
parasites
rely
on
a
third
party
an
intermediate
host
where
the
parasite
does
not
reproduce
sexually
to
carry
them
from
one
definitive
host
to
another
these
parasites
are
microorganisms
namely
protozoa
bacteria
or
viruses
often
intracellular
pathogens
causing
disease
their
vectors
are
mostly
hematophagic
arthropods
such
as
fleas
lice
ticks
and
mosquitoes
for
example
the
deer
tick
ixodes
scapularis
acts
as
a
vector
for
diseases
including
lyme
disease
babesiosis
and
anaplasmosis
protozoan
endoparasites
such
as
the
malarial
parasites
in
the
genus
plasmodium
and
sleeping
sickness
parasites
in
the
genus
trypanosoma
infective
stages
in
the
host's
blood
are
transported
to
new
hosts
by
biting
insects
parasitoids
are
insects
which
sooner
or
later
kill
their
hosts
placing
their
relationship
close
to
predation
most
parasitoids
are
hymenopterans
parasitoid
wasps
others
include
dipterans
such
as
phorid
flies
they
can
be
divided
into
two
groups
idiobionts
and
koinobionts
differing
in
their
treatment
of
their
hosts
idiobiont
parasitoids
sting
their
often
large
prey
on
capture
either
killing
them
outright
or
paralysing
them
immediately
the
immobilised
prey
is
then
carried
to
a
nest
sometimes
alongside
other
prey
if
it
is
not
large
enough
to
support
a
parasitoid
throughout
its
development
an
egg
is
laid
on
top
of
the
prey
and
the
nest
is
then
sealed
the
parasitoid
develops
rapidly
through
its
larval
and
pupal
stages
feeding
on
the
provisions
left
for
it
koinobiont
parasitoids
which
include
flies
as
well
as
wasps
lay
their
eggs
inside
young
hosts
usually
larvae
these
are
allowed
to
go
on
growing
so
the
host
and
parasitoid
develop
together
for
an
extended
period
ending
when
the
parasitoids
emerge
as
adults
leaving
the
prey
dead
eaten
from
inside
some
koinobionts
regulate
their
host's
development
for
example
preventing
it
from
pupating
or
making
it
moult
whenever
the
parasitoid
is
ready
to
moult
they
may
do
this
by
producing
hormones
that
mimic
the
host's
moulting
hormones
ecdysteroids
or
by
regulating
the
host's
endocrine
system
a
micropredator
attacks
more
than
one
host
reducing
each
host's
fitness
at
least
a
small
amount
and
is
only
in
contact
with
any
one
host
intermittently
this
makes
them
suitable
as
vectors
as
they
can
pass
smaller
parasites
from
one
host
to
another
most
micropredators
are
hematophagic
feeding
on
blood
they
include
annelids
such
as
leeches
crustaceans
such
as
branchiurans
and
gnathiid
isopods
various
dipterans
such
as
mosquitoes
and
tsetse
flies
other
arthropods
such
as
fleas
and
ticks
vertebrates
such
as
lampreys
and
mammals
such
as
vampire
bats
parasites
use
a
variety
of
methods
to
infect
animal
hosts
including
physical
contact
the
fecal–oral
other
collaborative
online
encyclopedias
were
attempted
before
wikipedia
but
none
were
as
successful
wikipedia
began
as
a
complementary
project
for
nupedia
a
free
online
english-language
encyclopedia
project
whose
articles
were
written
by
experts
and
reviewed
under
a
formal
process
it
was
founded
on
march
under
the
ownership
of
bomis
a
web
portal
company
its
main
figures
were
bomis
ceo
jimmy
wales
and
larry
sanger
editor-in-chief
for
nupedia
and
later
wikipedia
nupedia
was
initially
licensed
under
its
own
nupedia
open

license
but
even
before
wikipedia
was
founded
nupedia
switched
to
the
gnu

at
the
urging
of
richard
stallman
wales
is
credited
with
defining
the
goal
of
making
a

while
sanger
is
credited
with
the
strategy
of
using
a
wiki
to
reach
that
goal
on
january
sanger
proposed
on
the
nupedia
mailing
list
to
create
a
wiki
as
a
feeder
project
for
nupedia
wikipedia
com
and
wikipedia

were
registered
on
january
and

respectively
and
wikipedia
was
launched
on
january
as
a
single
english-language
edition
at
www
wikipedia
com
and
announced
by
sanger
on
the
nupedia
mailing
list
wikipedia's
policy
of
neutral
point-of-view
was
codified
in
its
first
months
otherwise
there
were
relatively
few
rules
initially
and
wikipedia
operated
independently
of
nupedia
originally
bomis
intended
to
make
wikipedia
a
business
for

wikipedia
gained
early
contributors
from
nupedia
slashdot

were
also
created
with
a
total

nupedia
and
wikipedia
coexisted
until
the
former's
servers
were
taken
down
permanently
in
and
its
text
was
incorporated
into
wikipedia
the
english
wikipedia
passed
the
mark
of
two
million
articles
on
september
making
it
the
largest
encyclopedia
ever
assembled
surpassing
the
yongle
encyclopedia
which
had
held
the
record
for
almost
years
citing
fears
of
commercial
advertising
and
lack
of
control
in
wikipedia
users
of
the
spanish
wikipedia
forked
from
wikipedia
to
create
the
enciclopedia
libre
in
february
these
moves
encouraged
wales
to
announce
that
wikipedia
would
not
display
advertisements
and
to
change
wikipedia's
domain
from
wikipedia
com
to
wikipedia
org
though
the
english
wikipedia
reached
three
million
articles
in
august
the
growth
of
the
edition
in
terms
of
the
numbers
of
new
articles
and
of
contributors
appears
to
have
peaked
around
early
around
articles
were
added
daily
to
the
encyclopedia
in
by
that
average
was
roughly
a
team
at
the
palo
alto
research
center
attributed
this
slowing
of
growth
to
the
project's
increasing
exclusivity
and
resistance
to
change
others
suggest
that
the
growth
is
flattening
naturally
because
articles
that
could
be
called
low-hanging
fruit—topics
that
clearly
merit
an
article—have
already
been
created
and
built
up
extensively
in
november
a
researcher
at
the
rey
juan
carlos
university
in
madrid
spain
found
that
the
english
wikipedia
had
lost
editors
during
the
first
three
months
of
in
comparison
the
concept
of
document
has
been
defined
by
suzanne
briet
as
any
concrete
or
symbolic
indication
preserved
or
recorded
for
reconstructing
or
for
proving
a
phenomenon
whether
physical
or
mental
an
often
cited
article
concludes
that
the
evolving
notion
of
document
among
jonathan
priest
otlet
briet
schürmeyer
and
the
other
documentalists
increasingly
emphasized
whatever
functioned
as
a
document
rather
than
traditional
physical
forms
of
documents
the
shift
to
digital
technology
would
seem
to
make
this
distinction
even
more
important
levy's
thoughtful
analyses
have
shown
that
an
emphasis
on
the
technology
of
digital
documents
has
impeded
our
understanding
of
digital
documents
as
documents
e
g
levy
a
conventional
document
such
as
a
mail

or

physically
in

the
classic
example
provided
by
suzanne
briet
is
an

papyrus
was
used
for

in

perhaps
as
early
as
the
first
dynasty
although
the
first
evidence
is
from
the
account
books
of

nefertiti
kakai
of

about
bc
papyrus
sheets
were
glued
together
to
form
a
scroll
tree
bark
such
as
lime
and
other
materials
were
also
used
according
to
herodotus
history
:
the
phoenicians
brought
writing
and
papyrus
to
greece
around
the
th
or
th
century
bc
the
greek
word
for
papyrus
as
writing
material
biblion
and
book
biblos
come
from
the
phoenician
port
town
byblos
through
which
papyrus
was
exported
to
greece
from
greek
we
also
derive
the
word
tome
greek:
τόμος
which
originally
meant
a
slice
or
piece
and
from
there
began
to
denote
a
roll
of
papyrus
tomus
was
used
by
the
latins
with
exactly
the

meaning
as

the
explanation
by
isidore
of
seville
whether
made
from
papyrus
parchment
or
paper
scrolls
were
the
dominant
form
of

in
the
hellenistic
roman
chinese
hebrew
and
macedonian
cultures
the
more
modern
codex
book
format
form
took
over
the
roman
world
by
late
antiquity
but
the
scroll
format
persisted
much
longer
in
asia
isidore
of
seville
d
explained
the
then-current
relation
between
codex
book
and
scroll
in
his
etymologiae
vi
:
a
codex
is
composed
of
many
books
a
book
is
of
one
scroll
it
is
called
codex
by
way
of
metaphor
from
the
trunks
codex
of
trees
or
vines
as
if
it
were
a
wooden
stock
because
it
contains
in
itself
a
multitude
of
books
as
it
were
of
branches
modern
since
musical
given
the
wide
range
of
styles
in
european
classical
music
from
medieval
plainchant
sung
by
monks
to
classical
and
romantic
symphonies
for
orchestra
from
the
and
to
avant-garde
atonal
compositions
for
solo
piano
from
the
it
is
difficult
to
list
characteristics
that
can
be
attributed
to
all
works
of
that
type
however
there
are
characteristics
that
classical
music
contains
that
few
or
no
other
genres
of
music
contain
such
as
the
use
of
music
notation
and
the
performance
of
complex
forms
of
solo
instrumental
works
e
g
the
fugue
furthermore
while
the
symphony
did
not
exist
prior
to
the
late
th
century
the
symphony
ensemble—and
the
works
written
for
it—have
become
a
defining
feature
of
classical
music
the
key
characteristic
of
european
classical
music
that
distinguishes
it
from
popular
music
and
folk
music
is
that
the
repertoire
tends
to
be
written
down
in
musical
notation
creating
a
musical
part
or
score
this
score
typically
determines
details
of
rhythm
pitch
and
where
two
or
more
musicians
whether
singers
or
instrumentalists
are
involved
how
the
various
parts
are
coordinated
the
written
quality
of
the
music
has
enabled
a
high
level
of
complexity
within
them:
fugues
for
instance
achieve
a
remarkable
marriage
of
boldly
distinctive
melodic
lines
weaving
in
counterpoint
yet
creating
a
coherent
harmonic
logic
that
would
be
difficult
to
achieve
in
the
heat
of
live
improvisation
the
use
of
written
notation
also
preserves
a
record
of
the
works
and
enables
classical
musicians
to
perform
music
from
many
centuries
ago
musical
notation
enables
s-era
performers
to
sing
a
choral
work
from
the
renaissance
era
or
a
baroque
concerto
with
many
of
the
features
of
the
music
the
melodies
lyrics
forms
and
rhythms
being
reproduced
that
said
the
score
does
allow
the
interpreter
to
make
choices
on
how
to
perform
a
historical
work
for
example
if
the
tempo
is
written
with
an
italian
instruction
e
g
allegro
it
is
not
known
exactly
how
fast
the
piece
should
be
played
as
well
in
the
baroque
era
many
works
that
were
designed
for
basso
continuo
accompaniment
do
not
specify
which
instruments
should
play
the
accompaniment
or
exactly
how
the
chordal
instrument
harpsichord
lute
etc
should
play
the
chords
which
are
not
notated
in
the
part
only
a
figured
bass
symbol
in
the
bass
part
is
used
to
guide
the
chord-playing
performer
the
performer
and
the
conductor
have
a
range
of
options
for
musical
expression
and
interpretation
of
a
scored
piece
including
the
phrasing
of
melodies
the
time
taken
during
fermatas
held
notes
or
pauses
and
the
use
or
choice
not
to
use
of
effects
such
as
vibrato
or
glissando
these
effects
are
possible
on
various
stringed
brass
and
woodwind
instruments
and
with
the
human
voice
although
classical
music
in
the
has
lost
most
of
its
tradition
for
musical
improvisation
from
the
baroque
era
to
the
romantic
era
there
are
examples
of
performers
who
could
improvise
in
the
style
of
their
era
in
the
baroque
era
organ
performers
would
improvise
preludes

performers
playing

would
improvise
chords
from
the
figured
bass
symbols
beneath
the
bass
notes
of
the
basso
continuo
part
and
both
vocal
and
instrumental
performers
would
improvise

began
to
adopt
secular
forms
such
as

he
reduceth

this
usage
of
the
term
referred
to
a
human
computer
a
person
who
carried
out
calculations
or

the
word
continued
with
the
same
meaning
until
the
middle
of
the
th
century
originally
women
were
often
hired
as
human

because
they
could
be
paid
less
than
their
male
counterparts
by
most
human
computers
were
women
from
the
end
of
the
th
century
the
word
began
to
take
on
its
more
familiar
meaning
a
machine
that
carries
out

gives
the
first

indicates
that
the
modern

dates
from
under
this

been
used
to

in
lord
kelvin
had
already
discussed
the
possible
construction
of

but
he
had
been
stymied
by
the
limited
output
torque
of
the
ball-and-disk

charles
babbage
an
english
mechanical
engineer
and
polymath
originated
the
concept
of
a
programmable
computer
considered
the
father
of
the
computer
he
conceptualized
and
invented
the
first
mechanical
computer
in
the
early
th
century
after
working
on
his
revolutionary
difference
engine
designed
to
aid
in
navigational
calculations
in
he
realized
that
a
much
more
general
design
an
analytical
engine
was
possible
the
input
of
programs
and
data
was
to
be
provided
to
the
machine
via
punched
cards
a
method
being
used
at
the
time
to
direct
mechanical
looms
such
as
the
jacquard
loom
for
output
the
machine
would
have
a
printer
a
curve
plotter
and
a
bell
the
machine
would
also
be
able
to
punch
numbers
onto
cards
to
be
read
in
later
the
engine
incorporated
an
arithmetic
logic
unit
control
flow
in
the
form
of
conditional
branching
and
loops
and
integrated
memory
making
it
the
first
design
for
a
general-purpose
computer
that
could
be
described
in
modern
terms
as
turing-complete
the
machine
was
about
a
century
ahead
of
its
time
all
the
parts
for
his
machine
had
to
be
made
by
hand
–
this
was
a
major
problem
for
a
device
with
thousands
of
parts
eventually
the
project
was
dissolved
with
the
decision
of
the
british
government
to
cease
funding
babbage's
failure
to
complete
the
analytical
engine
can
be
chiefly
attributed
to
difficulties
not
only
of
politics
and
financing
but
also
to
his
desire
to
develop
an
increasingly
sophisticated
computer
and
to
move
ahead
faster
than
anyone
else
could
follow
nevertheless
his
son
henry
babbage
completed
a
simplified
version
of
the
analytical
engine's
computing
unit
the
mill
in
he
gave
a
successful
demonstration
of
its
use
in
computing
tables
in
during
the
first
half
of
the
th
century
many
scientific
computing
needs
were
met
by
increasingly
sophisticated
analog
computers
which
used
a
direct
mechanical
or
electrical
model
of
the
problem
as
a
basis
for
computation
however
these
were
not
programmable
and
generally
lacked
the
versatility
and
accuracy
of
modern
digital
computers

the
principle
of
the
modern
computer
was
proposed
by
alan
turing
in
his
seminal
paper
on
computable
numbers
turing
proposed
a
simple
device
that
he
called
universal
computing
machine
and
that
is
now
known
as
a
universal
turing
machine
he
proved
that
such
a
machine
is
capable
of
computing
anything
that
is
computable
by
executing
instructions
program
stored
on
tape
allowing
the
machine
to
be
programmable
the
fundamental
concept
of
turing's
design
is
the
stored
program
where
all
the
instructions
for
computing
are
stored
in
memory
von
neumann
acknowledged
that
the
central
concept
of
the
modern
computer
was
due
to
this
paper
turing
machines
are
to
this
day
a
central
object
of
study
in
theory
of
computation
except
for
the
limitations
imposed
by
their
finite
memory
stores
modern
computers
are
said
to
be
turing-complete
which
is
to
say
they
have
algorithm
execution
capability
equivalent
to
a
universal
turing
machine
early
computing
machines
had
fixed
programs
changing
its
function
required
the
re-wiring
and
re-structuring
of
the
machine
with
the
proposal
of
the
stored-program
computer
this
changed
a
stored-program
computer
includes
by
design
an
instruction
set
and
can
store
in
memory
a
set
of
instructions
a
program
that
details
the
computation
the
theoretical
basis
for
the
stored-program
computer
was
laid
by
alan
turing
in
his
paper
in
turing
joined
the
national
physical
laboratory
and
began
work
on
developing
an
electronic
stored-program

was
the
first
specification
for

draft
of

it
was
designed
as
a

the
first
random-access
digital
storage
device
although
the
computer
was
considered
small
and
primitive
by
the
standards
of
its
time
it
was
the
first
working
machine
to
contain
all
of
the
elements
essential
to
a
modern
electronic
computer
as
soon
as
the
baby
had
demonstrated
the
feasibility
of
its
design
a
project
was
initiated
at
the
university
to
develop
it
into
a
more
usable
computer
the
manchester
mark
grace
hopper
was
the
first
person
to
develop
a

built
by

it
was
delivered
to
the
university
of
manchester
in
february
at
least
seven
of
these
later
machines
were
delivered
between
and
one
of
them
to
shell
labs
in
amsterdam
in
october
the
directors
of
british
catering
company
j
lyons
company
decided
to
take
an
active
role
in
promoting
the
commercial
development
of
computers
the
leo
i
computer
became
operational
in
april
and
ran
the
world's
first
regular
routine
office
computer
job
the
bipolar
transistor
was
invented
in
from
onwards
transistors
replaced
vacuum
tubes
in
computer
designs
giving
rise
to
the
second
generation
of
computers
compared
to
vacuum
tubes
transistors
have
many
advantages:
they
are
smaller
and
require
less
power
than
vacuum
tubes
so
give
off
less
heat
silicon
junction
transistors
were
much
more
reliable
than
vacuum
tubes
and
had
longer
indefinite
service
life
transistorized
computers
could
contain
tens
of
thousands
of
binary
logic
circuits
in
a
relatively
compact
space
at
the
university
of
manchester
a
team
under
the
leadership
of
tom
kilburn
designed
and
built
a
machine
using
the
newly
developed
transistors
instead
of
valves
their
first
transistorised
computer
and
the
first
in
the
world
was
operational
by
and
a
second
version
was
completed
there
in
april
however
the
machine
did
make
use
of
valves
to
generate
its
khz
clock
waveforms
and
in
the
circuitry
to
read
and
write
on
its
magnetic
drum
memory
so
it
was
not
the
first
completely
transistorized
computer
that
distinction
goes
to
the
harwell
the
title
president
is
derived
from
the
latin
prae-
before
sedere
to
sit
as
such
it
originally
designated
the
officer
who
presides
over
or
sits
before
a
gathering
and
ensures
that
debate
is
conducted
according
to
the
rules
of
order
see
also
chairman
and
speaker
but
today
it
most
commonly
refers
to
an
executive
official
in
any
social
organization
early
examples
are
from
the
universities
of
oxford
and
cambridge
from
and
the
founding
president
of
the
royal
society
william
brouncker
in
this
usage
survives
today
in
the
title
of
such
offices
as
president
of
the
board
of
trade
and
lord
president
of
the
council
in
the
united
kingdom
as

constitutionally
assigned
to
the
vice

the
officiating
priest
at
certain
anglican
religious
services
too
is
sometimes
called
the
president
in
this
sense
however
the
most
common
modern
usage
is
as
the
title
of
a
head
of
state
in
a
republic
in
pre-revolutionary

the

of
the
so-called
noblesse
de

nobility
of
the
gown
with
considerable
judicial
as
well
as
administrative
authority
the
name
referred
to
his
primary
role
of
presiding
over
trials
and
other
hearings
in
the
th
and
th
centuries
seats
in
the
parlements
including
presidencies
became
effectively
hereditary
since
the
holder
of
the
office
could
ensure
that
it
would
pass
to
an
heir
by
paying
the
crown
a
special
tax
known
as
the
paulette
the
post
of
first
president
premier
président
however
could
only
be
held
by
the
king's
nominees
the
parlements
were
abolished
by
the
french
revolution
in
modern
france
the
chief
judge
of
a
court
is
known
as
its
president
président
de
la
cour
the
first
usage
of
the
word
president
to
denote
the
highest
official
in
a
government
was
during
the
commonwealth
of
england
after
the
abolition
of

the

whose
members
were
elected
by

of
commons
became
the

government
of

the

of

was
the
successor
of
the
privy
council
which
had
previously
been
headed
by
the
lord
president
its
successor
the
council
of
state
was
also
headed
by
a
lord
president
the
first
of
which
was
john
bradshaw
however
the
lord
president
alone
was
not
head
of
state
because
that
office
was
vested
in
the
council
as
a
whole
the
modern
usage
of
the
term
president
to
designate
a
single
numerous
definitions
of
law
have
been
put
forward
over
the
centuries
the
third
new
international
dictionary
from
merriam-webster
defines
law
as:
law
is
a
binding
custom
or
practice
of
a
community
a
rule
or
mode
of
conduct
or
action
that
is
prescribed
or
formally
recognized
as
binding
by
a
supreme
controlling
authority
or
is
made
obligatory
by
a
sanction
as
an
edict
decree
rescript
order
ordinance
statute
resolution
rule
judicial
decision
or
usage
made
recognized
or
enforced
by
the
controlling
authority
the
dictionary
of
the
history
of
ideas
published
by
scribner's
in
defined
the
concept
of
law
accordingly
as:
a
legal
system
is
the
most
explicit
institutionalized
and
complex
mode
of
regulating
human
conduct
at
the
same
time
it
plays
only
one
part
in
the
congeries
of
rules
which
influence
behavior
for
social
and
moral
rules
of
a
less
institutionalized
kind
are
also
of
great
importance
there
have
been
several
attempts
to
produce
a
universally
acceptable
definition
of
law
in
one
source
indicated
that
no
such
definition
could
be
produced
mccoubrey
and
white
said
that
the
question
what
is
law?
has
no
simple
answer
glanville
williams
said
that
the
meaning
of
the
word
law
depends
on
the
context
in
which
that
word
is
used
he
said
that
for
example
early
customary
law
and
municipal
law
were
contexts
where
the
word
law
had
two
different
and
irreconcilable
meanings
thurman
arnold
said
that
it
is
obvious
that
it
is
impossible
to
define
the
word
law
and
that
it
is
also
equally
obvious
that
the
struggle
to
define
that
word
should
not
ever
be
abandoned
it
is
possible
to
take
the
view
that
there
is
no
need
to
define
the
word
law
e
g
let's
forget
about
generalities
and
get
down
to
cases
the
history
of
law
links
closely
to
the
development
of
civilization
ancient
egyptian
law
dating
as
far
back
as
bc
contained
a
civil
code
that
was
probably
broken
into
twelve
books
it
was
based
on
the
concept
of
ma'at
characterised
by
tradition
rhetorical
speech
social
equality
and
impartiality
by
the
nd
century
bc
the
ancient
sumerian
ruler
ur-nammu
had
formulated
the
first
law
code
which
consisted
of
casuistic
statements
if
…
then
around
bc
king
hammurabi
further
developed
babylonian
law
by
codifying
and
inscribing
it
in
stone
hammurabi
placed
several
copies
of
his
law
code
throughout
the
kingdom
of
babylon
as
stelae
for
the
entire
public
to
see
this
became
known
as
the
codex
hammurabi
the
most
intact
copy
of
these
stelae
was
discovered
in
the
th
century
by
british
assyriologists
and
has
since
been
fully
transliterated
and
translated
into
various
languages
including
english
italian
german
and
french
the
old
testament
dates
back
to
bc
and
takes
the
form
of
moral
imperatives
as
recommendations
for
a
good
society
the
small
greek
city-state
ancient
athens
from
about
the
th
century
bc
was
the
first
society
to
be
based
on
broad
inclusion
of
its
citizenry
excluding
women
and
the
slave
class
however
athens
had
no
legal
science
or
single
word
for
law
relying
instead
on
the
three-way
distinction
between
divine
law
thémis
human
decree
nomos
and
custom
díkē
yet
ancient
greek
law
contained
major
constitutional
innovations
in
the
development
of
democracy
roman
law
was
heavily
influenced
by
greek
philosophy
but
its
detailed
rules
were
developed
by
professional
jurists
and
were
highly
sophisticated
over
the
centuries
between
the
rise
and
decline
of
the
roman
empire
law
was
adapted
to
cope
with
the
changing
social
situations
and
underwent
major
codification
under
theodosius
ii
and
justinian
i
although
codes
were
replaced
by
custom
and
case
law
during
the
dark
ages
roman
law
was
rediscovered
around
the
th
century
when
medieval
legal
scholars
began
to
research
roman
codes
and
adapt
their
concepts
latin
legal
maxims
called
brocards
were
compiled
for
guidance
in
medieval
england
royal
courts
developed
a
body
of
precedent
which
later
became
the
common
law
a
europe-wide
law
merchant
was
formed
so
that
merchants
could
trade
with
common
standards
of
practice
rather
than
with
the
many
splintered
facets
of
local
laws
the
law
merchant
a
precursor
to
modern
commercial
law
emphasised
the
freedom
to
contract
and
alienability
of
property
as
nationalism
grew
in
the
th
and
th
centuries
the
law
merchant
was
incorporated
into
countries'
local
law
under
new
civil
codes
the
napoleonic
and
german
codes
became
the
most
influential
in
contrast
to
english
common
law
which
consists
of
enormous
tomes
of
case
law
codes
in
small
books
are
easy
to
export
and
easy
for
judges
to
apply
however
today
there
are
signs
that
civil
and
common
law
are
converging
eu
law
is
codified
in
treaties
but
develops
through
the
precedent
laid
down
by
the
european
court
of
justice
ancient
india
and
china
represent
distinct
traditions
of
law
and
have
historically
had
independent
schools
of
legal
theory
and
practice
the

probably
compiled
around
ad
although
it
contains
older
material
and
the
manusmriti
c

ad
were
foundational
treatises
in
india
and
comprise
texts
considered
authoritative
legal
guidance
manu's
central
philosophy
was
tolerance
and
pluralism
and
was
cited
across
southeast
asia
this
hindu
tradition
along
with
islamic
law
was
supplanted
by
the
common
law
when
india
became
part
of
the
british
empire
malaysia
brunei
singapore
and
hong
kong
also
adopted
the
common
law
the
eastern
asia
legal
tradition
reflects
a
unique
blend
of
secular
and
religious
influences
japan
was
the
first
country
to
begin
modernising
its
legal
system
along
western
lines
by
importing
bits
of
the
french
but
mostly
the
german
civil
code
this
partly
reflected
germany's
status
as
a
rising
power
in
the
late
th
century
similarly
traditional
chinese
law
gave
way
to
westernisation
towards
the
final
years
of
the
qing
dynasty
in
the
form
of
six
private
law
codes
based
mainly
on
the
japanese
model
of
german
law
today
taiwanese
law
retains
the
closest
affinity
to
the
codifications
from
that
period
because
of
the
split
between
chiang
kai-shek's
nationalists
who
fled
there
and
mao
zedong's
communists
who
won
control
of
the
mainland
in
the
current
legal
infrastructure
in
the
people's
republic
of
china
was
heavily
influenced
by
soviet
socialist
law
which
essentially
inflates
administrative
law
at
the
expense
of
private
law
rights
due
to
rapid
industrialisation
today
china
is
undergoing
a
process
of
reform
at
least
in
terms
of
economic
if
not
social
and
political
rights
a
new
contract
code
in
represented
a
move
away
from
administrative
domination
furthermore
after
negotiations
lasting
fifteen
years
in
china

the
philosophy
of
law
is
commonly
known
as
general
jurisprudence
normative
jurisprudence
asks
what
should
law
be?
while
analytic
jurisprudence
asks
what
is
law?
john
austin's
utilitarian
answer
was
that
law
is
commands
backed
by
threat
of
sanctions
from
a
sovereign
to
whom
people
have
a
habit
of
obedience
natural
lawyers
on
the
other
side
such
as
jean-jacques
rousseau
argue
that
law
reflects
essentially
moral
and
unchangeable
laws
of
nature
the
concept
of
natural
law
emerged
in
ancient
greek
philosophy
concurrently
and
in
connection
with
the
notion
of
justice
and
re-entered
the
mainstream
of
western
culture
through
the
writings
of
thomas
aquinas
notably
his
treatise
on
law
hugo
grotius
the
founder
of
a
purely
rationalistic
system
of
natural
law
argued
that
law
arises
from
both
a
social
impulse—as
aristotle
had
indicated—and
reason
immanuel
kant
believed
a
moral
imperative
requires
laws
be
chosen
as
though
they
should
hold
as
universal
laws
of
nature
jeremy
bentham
and
his
student
austin
following
david
hume
believed
that
this
conflated
the
is
and
what
ought
to
be
problem
bentham
and
austin
argued
for
law's
positivism
that
real
law
is
entirely
separate
from
morality
kant
was
also
criticised
by
friedrich
nietzsche
who
rejected
the
principle
of
equality
and
believed
that
law
emanates
from
the
will
to
power
and
cannot
be
labelled
as
moral
or
immoral
in
the
austrian
philosopher
hans
kelsen
continued
the
positivist
tradition
in
his
book
the
pure
theory
of
law
kelsen
believed
that
although
law
is
separate
from
morality
it
is
endowed
with
normativity
meaning
we
ought
to
obey
it
while
laws
are
positive
is
statements
e
g
the
fine
for
reversing
on
a
highway
is
€
law
tells
us
what
we
should
do
thus
each
legal
system
can
be
hypothesised
to
have
a
basic
norm
grundnorm
instructing
us
to
obey
kelsen's
major
opponent
carl
schmitt
rejected
both
positivism
and
the
idea
of
the
rule
of
law
because
he
did
not
accept
the
primacy
of
abstract
normative
principles
over
concrete
political
positions
and
decisions
therefore
schmitt
advocated
a
jurisprudence
of
the
exception
state
of
emergency
which
denied
that
legal
norms
could
encompass
all
of
political
experience
later
in
the
th
century
h
l
a
hart
attacked
austin
for
his
simplifications
and
kelsen
for
his
fictions
in
the
concept
of
law
hart
argued
law
is
a
system
of
rules
divided
into
primary
rules
of
conduct
and
secondary
ones
rules
addressed
to
officials
to
administer
primary
rules
secondary
rules
are
further
divided
into
rules
of
adjudication
to
resolve
legal
disputes
rules
of
change
allowing
laws
to
be
varied
and
the
rule
of
recognition
allowing
laws
to
be
identified
as
valid
two
of
hart's
students
continued
the
debate:
in
his
book
law's
empire
ronald
dworkin
attacked
hart
and
the
positivists
for
their
refusal
to
treat
law
as
a
moral
issue
dworkin
argues
that
law
is
an
interpretive
concept
that
requires
judges
to
find
the
best
fitting
and
most
just
solution
to
a
legal
dispute
given
their
constitutional
traditions
joseph
raz
on
the
other
hand
defended
a
government
is
the
system
to
govern
a
state
or
community
the
word
government
derives
ultimately
from
the
greek
verb
κυβερνάω
[kubernáo]
meaning
to
steer
with
gubernaculum
rudder
the
metaphorical
sense
being
attested
in
plato's
ship
of
state
the
columbia
encyclopedia
defines
government
as
a
system
of
social
control
under
which
the
right
to
make
laws
and
the
right
to
enforce
them
is
vested
in
a
particular
group
in
society
while
all
types
of
organizations
have
governance
the
word
government
is
often
used
more
specifically
to
refer
to
the
approximately
independent
national
governments
on
earth
as
well
as
their
subsidiary
organizations
in
the
commonwealth
of
nations
the
word
government
is
also
used
more
narrowly
to
refer
to
the
ministry
collective
executive
a
collective
group
of
people
that
exercises
executive
authority
in
a
state
or
metonymically
to
the
governing
cabinet
as
part
of
the
executive
finally
government
is
also
sometimes
used
in
english
as
a
synonym
for
governance
the
moment
and
place
that
the
phenomenon
of
human
government
developed
is
lost
in
time
however
history
does
record
the
formations
of
early
governments
about
years
ago
the
first
small
city-states
appeared
by
the
third
to
second
millenniums
bc
some
of
these
had
developed
into
larger
governed
areas:
sumer
ancient
egypt
the
indus
valley
civilization
and
the
yellow
river
civilization
the
development
of
agriculture
and
water
control
projects
were
a
catalyst
for
the
development
of
governments
for
many
thousands
of
years
when
people
were
hunter-gatherers
and
small
scale
farmers
humans
lived
in
small
non-hierarchical
and
self-sufficient
communities
on
occasion
a
chief
of
a
tribe
was
elected
by
various
rituals
or
tests
of
strength
to
govern
his
tribe
sometimes
with
a
group
of
elder
tribesmen
as
a
council
the
human
ability
to
precisely
communicate
abstract
learned
information
allowed
humans
to
become
ever
more
effective
at
agriculture
and
that
allowed
for
ever
increasing
population
densities
david
christian
explains
how
this
resulted
in
states
with
laws
and
governments:
as
farming
populations
gathered
in
larger
and
denser
communities
interactions
between
different
groups
increased
and
the
social
pressure
rose
until
in
a
striking
parallel
with
star
formation
new
structures
suddenly
appeared
together
with
a
new
level
of
complexity
like
stars
cities
and
states
reorganize
and
energize
the
smaller
objects
within
their
gravitational
field
starting
at
the
end
of
the
th
century
the
prevalence
of
republican
forms
of
government
grew
the
glorious
revolution
in
england
the
american
revolution
and
the
french
revolution
contributed
to
the
growth
of
representative
forms
of
government
the
soviet
union
was
the
first
large
country
to
have
a
communist
government
since
the
fall
of
the
berlin
wall
liberal
democracy
has
become
an
even
more
prevalent
form
of
government
in
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
century
there
was
a
significant
increase
in
the
size
and
scale
of
government
at
the
national
level
this
included
the
regulation
of
corporations
and
the
development
of
the
welfare
state
in
political
science
it
has
long
been
a
goal
to
create
a
typology
or
taxonomy
of
polities
as
typologies
of
political
systems
are
not
obvious
it
is
especially
important
in
the
political
science
fields
of
comparative
politics
and
international
relations
like
all
categories
discerned
within
forms
of
government
the
boundaries
of
government
classifications
are
either
fluid
or
ill-defined
superficially
all
governments
have
an
official
or
ideal
form
the
united
states
is
a
constitutional
republic
while
the
former
soviet
union
was
a
socialist
republic
however
self-identification
is
not
objective
and
as
kopstein
and
lichbach
argue
defining
regimes
can
be
tricky
for
example
elections
are
a
defining
characteristic
of
an
electoral
democracy
but
in
practice
elections
in
the
former
soviet
union
were
not
free
and
fair
and
took
place
in
a
one-party
state
voltaire
argued
that
the
holy
roman
empire
is
neither
holy
nor
roman
nor
an
empire
many
governments
that
officially
call
themselves
a
democratic
republic
are
not
democratic
nor
a
republic
they
are
usually
a
dictatorship
de
facto
communist
dictatorships
have
been
especially
prone
to
use
this
term
for
example
the
official
name
of
north
vietnam
was
the
democratic
republic
of
vietnam
china
uses
a
variant
the
people's
republic
of
china
thus
in
many
practical
classifications
it
would
not
be
considered
democratic
identifying
a
form
of
government
is
also
difficult
because
many
political
systems
originate
as
socio-economic
movements
and
are
then
carried
into
governments
by
parties
naming
themselves
after
those
movements
all
with
competing
political-ideologies
experience
with
those
movements
in
power
and
the
strong
ties
they
may
have
to
particular
forms
of
government
can
cause
them
to
be
considered
as
forms
of
government
in
themselves
other
complications
include
general
non-consensus
or
deliberate
distortion
or
bias
of
reasonable
technical
definitions
to
political
ideologies
and
associated
forms
of
governing
due
to
the
nature
of
politics
in
the
modern
era
for
example:
the
meaning
of
conservatism
in
the
united
states
has
little
in
common
with
the
way
the
word's
definition
is
used
elsewhere
as
ribuffo
notes
what
americans
now
call
conservatism
much
of
the
world
calls
liberalism
or
neoliberalism
since
the
conservatism
in
the
united
states
has
been
chiefly
associated
with
the
republican
party
however
during
the
era
of
segregation
many
southern
democrats
were
conservatives
and
they
played
a
key
role
in
the
conservative
coalition
that
controlled
congress
from
to
every
country
in
the
world
is
ruled
by
a
system
of
governance
that
combines
at
least
three
or
more
political
or
economic
attributes
additionally
opinions
vary
by
individuals
concerning
the
types
and
properties
of
governments
that
exist
shades
of
gray
are
commonplace
in
any
government
and
its
corresponding
classification
even
the
most
liberal
democracies
limit
rival
political
activity
to
one
extent
or
another
while
the
most
tyrannical
dictatorships
must
organize
a
broad
base
of
support
thereby
creating
difficulties
for
pigeonholing
governments
into
narrow
categories
examples
include
the
claims
of
the
united
states
as
being
a
plutocracy
rather
than
a
democracy
since
some
american
voters
believe
elections
are
being
manipulated
by
wealthy
super
pacs
the
classical
greek
philosopher
plato
discusses
five
types
of
regimes:
aristocracy
timocracy
oligarchy
democracy
and
tyranny
plato
also
assigns
a
man
to
each
of
these
regimes
to
illustrate
what
they
stand
for
the
tyrannical
man
would
represent
tyranny
for
example
these
five
regimes
progressively
degenerate
starting
with
aristocracy
at
the
top
and
tyranny
at
the
bottom
one
method
of
classifying
governments
is
through
which
people
have
the
authority
to
rule
this
can
either
be
one
person
an
autocracy
such
as
the
use
of
prisons
can
be
traced
back
to
the
rise
of
the
state
as
a
form
of
social
organization
corresponding
with
the
advent
of
the
state
was
the
development
of
written
language
which
enabled
the
creation
of
formalized
legal
codes
as
official
guidelines
for
society
the
best
known
of
these
early
legal
codes
is
the
code
of
hammurabi
written
in
babylon
around
bc
the
penalties
for
violations
of
the
laws
in
hammurabi's
code
were
almost
exclusively
centered
on
the
concept
of
lex
talionis
the
law
of
retaliation
whereby
people
were
punished
as
a
form
of
vengeance
often
by
the
victims
themselves
this
notion
of
punishment
as
vengeance
or
retaliation
can
also
be
found
in
many
other
legal
codes
from
early
civilizations
including
the
ancient
sumerian
codes
the
indian
manama
dharma
astra
the
hermes
trismegistus
of
egypt
and
the
israelite
mosaic
law
some
ancient
greek
philosophers
such
as
plato
began
to
develop
ideas
of
using
punishment
to
reform
offenders
instead
of
simply
using
it
as
retribution
imprisonment
as
a
penalty
was
used
initially
for
those
who
could
not
afford
to
pay
their
fines
eventually
since
impoverished
athenians
could
not
pay
their
fines
leading
to
indefinite
periods
of
imprisonment
time
limits
were
set
instead
the
prison
in
ancient
athens
was
known
as
the
desmoterion
place
of
chains
the
romans
were
among
the
first
to
use
prisons
as
a
form
of
punishment
rather
than
simply
for
detention
a
variety
of
existing
structures
were
used
to
house
prisoners
such
as
metal
cages
basements
of
public
buildings
and
quarries
one
of
the
most
notable
roman
prisons
was
the
mamertine
prison
established
around
b
c
by
ancus
marcius
the
mamertine
prison
was
located
within
a
sewer
system
beneath
ancient
rome
and
contained
a
large
network
of
dungeons
where
prisoners
were
held
in
squalid
conditions
contaminated
with
human
waste
forced
labor
on
public
works
projects
was
also
a
common
form
of
punishment
in
many
cases
citizens
were
sentenced
to
slavery
often
in
ergastula
a
primitive
form
of
prison
where
unruly
slaves
were
chained
to
workbenches
and
performed
hard
labor
during
the
middle
ages
in
europe
castles
fortresses
and
the
basements
of
public
buildings
were
often
used
as
makeshift
prisons
the
possession
of
the
right
and
the
capability
to
imprison
citizens
however
granted
an
air
of
legitimacy
to
officials
at
all
levels
of
government
from
kings
to
regional
courts
to
city
councils
and
the
ability
to
have
someone
imprisoned
or
killed
served
as
a
signifier
of
who
in
society
possessed
power
or
authority
over
others
another
common
punishment
was
sentencing
people
to
galley
slavery
which
involved
chaining
prisoners
together
in
the
bottoms
of
ships
and
forcing
them
to
row
on
naval
or
merchant
vessels
from
the
late
th
century
and
during
the
th
century
popular
resistance
to
public
execution
and
torture
became
more
widespread
both
in
europe
and
in
the
united
states
particularly
under
the
bloody
code
with
few
sentencing
alternatives
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
for
petty
crimes
such
as
theft
was
proving
increasingly
unpopular
with
the
public
many
jurors
were
refusing
to
convict
defendants
of
petty
crimes
when
they
knew
the
defendants
would
be
sentenced
to
death
rulers
began
looking
for
means
to
punish
and
control
their
subjects
in
a
way
that
did
not
cause
people
to
associate
them
with
spectacles
of
tyrannical
and
sadistic
violence
they
developed
systems
of
mass
incarceration
often
with
hard
labor
as
a
solution
the
prison
reform
movement
that
arose
at
this
time
was
heavily
influenced
by
two
somewhat
contradictory
philosophies
the
first
was
based
in
enlightenment
ideas
of
utilitarianism
and
rationalism
and
suggested
that
prisons
should
simply
be
used
as
a
more
effective
substitute
for
public
corporal
punishments
such
as
whipping
hanging
etc
this
theory
referred
to
as
deterrence
claims
that
the
primary
purpose
of
prisons
is
to
be
so
harsh
and
terrifying
that
they
deter
people
from
committing
crimes
out
of
fear
of
going
to
prison
the
second
theory
which
saw
prisons
as
a
form
of
rehabilitation
or
moral
reform
was
based
on
religious
ideas
that
equated
crime
with
sin
and
saw
prisons
as
a
place
to
instruct
prisoners
in
christian
morality
obedience
and
proper
behavior
these
later
reformers
believed
that
prisons
could
be
constructed
as
humane
institutions
of
moral
instruction
and
that
prisoners'
behavior
could
be
corrected
so
that
when
they
were
released
they
would
be
model
members
of
society
the
concept
of
the
modern
prison
largely
remained
unknown
until
the
early
th-century
punishment
usually
consisted
of
physical
forms
of
punishment
including
capital
punishment
mutilation
flagellation
whipping
branding
and
non-physical
punishments
such
as
public
shaming
rituals
like
the
stocks
from
the
middle
ages
up
to
the
th
and
th
centuries
in
europe
imprisonment
was
rarely
used
as
a
punishment
in
its
own
right
and
prisons
were
mainly
to
hold
those
awaiting
trial
and
convicts
awaiting
punishment
however
an
important
innovation
at
the
time
was
the
bridewell
house
of
corrections
located
at
bridewell
palace
in
london
which
resulted
in
the
building
of
other
houses
of
correction
these
houses
held
mostly
petty
offenders
vagrants
and
the
disorderly
local
poor
in
these
facilities
inmates
were
given
jobs
and
through
prison
labor
they
were
taught
how
to
work
for
a
living
by
the
end
of
the
th
century
houses
of
correction
were
absorbed
into
local
prison
facilities
under
the
control
of
the
local
justice
of
the
peace
england
used
penal
transportation
of
convicted
criminals
and
others
generally
young
and
poor
for
a
term
of
indentured
servitude
within
the
general
population
of
british
america
between
the
and
the
transportation
act
made
this
option
available
for
lesser
crimes
or
offered
it
by
discretion
as
a
longer-term
alternative
to
the
death
penalty
which
could
theoretically
be
imposed
for
the
growing
number
of
offenses
the
substantial
expansion
of
transportation
was
the
first
major
innovation
in
eighteenth-century
british
penal
practice
transportation
to
america
was
abruptly
suspended
by
the
criminal
law
act
geo
c
with
the
start
of
the
american
rebellion
while
sentencing
to
transportation
continued
the
act
instituted
a
punishment
policy
of
hard
labour
instead
the
suspension
of
transport
also
prompted
the
use
of
prisons
for
punishment
and
the
initial
start
of
a
prison
building
program
britain
would
resume
transportation
to
specifically
planned
penal
colonies
in
australia
between
and
gaols
at
the
time
were
run
as
business
ventures
and
contained
both
felons
and
debtors
the
latter
were
often
housed
with
their
wives
and
younger
children
the
gaolers
made
their
money
by
charging
the
inmates
for
food
drink
and
other
services
and
the
system
was
generally
corruptible
one
reform
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
the
establishment
of
the
london
bridewell
as
a
house
of
correction
for
women
and
children
it
was
the
first
facility
to
make
any
medical
services
available
to
prisoners

gave
rise
to

that
the
entire

has
access
to
in
many
cases
terms
such
as
disease
disorder
morbidity
sickness
and
illness
are
used
interchangeably
there
are
situations
however
when
specific
terms
are
considered
preferable
disease
the
term
disease
broadly
refers
to
any
condition
that
impairs
the
normal
functioning
of
the
body
for
this
reason
diseases
are
associated
with
dysfunctioning
of
the
body's
normal
homeostatic
processes
commonly
the
term
is
used
to
refer
specifically
to
infectious
diseases
which
are
clinically
evident
diseases
that
result
from
the
presence
of
pathogenic
microbial
agents
including
viruses
bacteria
fungi
protozoa
multicellular
organisms
and
aberrant
proteins
known
as
prions
an
infection
or
colonization
that
does
not
and
will
not
produce
clinically
evident
impairment
of
normal
functioning
such
as
the
presence
of
the
normal
bacteria
and
yeasts
in
the
gut
or
of
a
passenger
virus
is
not
considered
a
disease
by
contrast
an
infection
that
is
asymptomatic
during
its
incubation
period
but
expected
to
produce
symptoms
later
is
usually
considered
a
disease
non-infectious
diseases
are
all
other
diseases
including
most
forms
of
cancer
heart
disease
and
genetic
disease
acquired
disease
an
acquired
disease
is
one
that
began
at
some
point
during
one's
lifetime
as
opposed
to
disease
that
was
already
present
at
birth
which
is
congenital
disease
acquired
sounds
like
it
could
mean
caught
via
contagion
but
it
simply
means
acquired
sometime
after
birth
it
also
sounds
like
it
could
imply
secondary
disease
but
acquired
disease
can
be
primary
disease
acute
disease
an
acute
disease
is
one
of
a
short-term
nature
acute
the
term
sometimes
also
connotes
a
fulminant
nature
chronic
condition
or
chronic
disease
a
chronic
disease
is
one
that
persists
over
time
often
characterized
six
months
or
more
congenital
disorder
or
congenital

a
congenital
disorder
is
one
that
is
present
at
birth
it
is
often
a
genetic
disease
or
disorder
and
can
be
inherited
it
can
also
be
the
result
of
a
vertically
transmitted
infection
from
the
mother
such
as
hiv/aids
genetic
disease
a
genetic
disorder
or
disease
is
caused
by
one
or
more
genetic
mutations
it
is
often
inherited
but
some
mutations
are
random
and
de

hereditary
or
inherited
disease
a
hereditary
disease
is
a
type
of
genetic
disease
caused
by
genetic
mutations
that
are
hereditary
and
can
run
in
families
iatrogenic
disease
an
iatrogenic
disease
or
condition
is
one
that
caused
by
medical
intervention
whether
as
a
side
effect
of
a
treatment
or
as
an
inadvertent
outcome
idiopathic
disease
an
idiopathic
disease
has
an
unknown
cause
or
source
as
medical
science
has
advanced
many
diseases
with
entirely
unknown
causes
have
had
some
aspects
of
their
sources
explained
and
therefore
shed
their
idiopathic
status
for
example
when
germs
were
discovered
it
became
known
that
they
were
a
cause
of
infection
but
particular
germs
and
diseases
had
not
been
linked
in
another
example
it
is
known
that
autoimmunity
is
the
cause
of
some
forms
of
diabetes
mellitus
type
even
though
the
particular
molecular
pathways
by
which
it
works
are
not
yet
understood
it
is
also
common
to
know
certain
factors
are
associated
with
certain
diseases
however
association
and
causality
are
two
very
different
phenomena
as
a
third
cause
might
be
producing
the
disease
as
well
as
an
associated
phenomenon
incurable
disease
a
disease
that
cannot
be
cured
incurable
diseases
are
not
necessarily
terminal
diseases
and
sometimes
a
disease's
symptoms
can
be
treated
sufficiently
for
the
disease
to
have
little
or
no
impact
on
quality
of
life
primary
disease
a
primary
disease
is
a
disease
that
is
due
to
a
root
cause
of
illness
as
opposed
to
secondary
disease
which
is
a
sequela
or
complication
that
is
caused
by
the
primary
disease
for
example
a
common
cold
is
a
there
is
no
easy
way
to
determine
when
clothing
was
first
developed
but
some
information
has
been
inferred
by
studying
lice
which
estimates
the
introduction
of
clothing
at
roughly
–
years
ago
the
most
obvious
function
of
clothing
is
to
improve
the
comfort
of
the
wearer
by
protecting
the
wearer
from
the
elements
in
hot
climates
clothing
provides
protection
from
sunburn
or
wind
damage
while
in
cold
climates
its
thermal
insulation
properties
are
generally
more
important
shelter
usually
reduces
the
functional
need
for
clothing
for
example
coats
hats
gloves
and
other
outer
layers
are
normally
removed
when
entering
a
warm
home
particularly
if
one
is
living
or
sleeping
there
similarly
clothing
has
seasonal
and
regional
aspects
so
that
thinner
materials
and
fewer
layers
of
clothing
are
generally
worn
in
warmer
regions
and
seasons
than
in
colder
ones
clothing
performs
a
range
of
social
and
cultural
functions
such
as
individual
occupational
and
gender
differentiation
and
social
status
in
many
societies
norms
about
clothing
reflect
standards
of
modesty
religion
gender
and
social
status
clothing
may
also
function
as
a
form
of
adornment
and
an
expression
of
personal
taste
or
style
clothing
can
be
and
has
in
the
past
been
made
from
a
very
wide
variety
of
materials
materials
have
ranged
from
leather
and
furs
to
woven
materials
to
elaborate
and
exotic
natural
and
synthetic
fabrics
not
all
body
coverings
are
regarded
as
clothing
articles
carried
rather
than
worn
such
as
purses
worn
on
a
single
part
of
the
body
and
easily
removed
scarves
worn
purely
for
adornment
jewelry
or
those
that
the
japanese
word
for
japan
is
日本
which
is
pronounced
nihon
or
nippon
and
literally
means
the
origin
of
the
sun
the
character
nichi
日
means
sun
or
day
hon
本
means
base
or
origin
the
compound
therefore
means
origin
of
the
sun
and
is
the
source
of
the
popular
western
epithet
land
of
the
rising
sun
the
earliest
record
of
the
name
nihon
appears
in
the
chinese
historical
records
of
the
tang
dynasty
the
old
book
of
tang
at
the
end
of
the
seventh
century
a
delegation
from
japan
requested
that
nihon
be
used
as
the
name
of
their
country
this
name
may
have
its
origin
in
a
letter
sent
in
and
recorded
in
the
official
history
of
the
sui
dynasty
prince
shōtoku
the
regent
of
japan
sent
a
mission
to
china
with
a
letter
in
which
he
called
himself
the
emperor
of
the
land
where
the
sun
rises
日出處天子
the
message
said:
here
i
the
emperor
of
the
country
where
the
sun
rises
send
a
letter
to
the
emperor
of
the
country
where
the
sun
sets
how

you[?]”
prior
to
the
adoption
of
nihon
other
terms
such
as
yamato
大和
or
great
wa
and
wakoku
倭国
were
used
the
term
wa
和
is
a
homophone
of
wo
倭
pronounced
wa
by
the
japanese
which
has
been
used
by
the
chinese
as
a
designation
for
the
japanese
as
early
as
the
third
century
three
kingdoms
period
another
form
of
wa
委
wei
in
chinese
was
used
for
an
early
state
in
japan
called
nakoku
during
the
han
dynasty
however
the
japanese
disliked
some
connotation
of
wa
倭
which
has
been
associated
in
china
with
concepts
like
dwarf
or
pygmy
and
it
was
therefore
replaced
with
the
substitute
character
wa
和
meaning
togetherness
harmony
the
english
word
japan
possibly
derives
from
the
historical
chinese
pronunciation
of
日本
the
old
mandarin
or
possibly
early

pronunciation
of
japan
was
recorded
by
marco

the
pronunciation
of
characters
日本
japan
is
zeppen
[zəʔpən]
the
old
malay
word
for
japan
japun
or
japang
was
borrowed
from
a
southern
coastal
chinese
dialect
probably
fukienese
or
ningpo
–
and
this
malay
word
was
encountered
by
portuguese
traders
in

asia
in
the
th
century
these
early
portuguese
traders
then
brought
the
word
to
europe
the
first
record
of
this
name
in

is
in

published
in

medieval

in

first
voyage
to
the

in

often
use
the

of
bosworth
field
in
to

the

historians
from
romance-speaking
countries
tend
to
divide
the
middle
ages
into
two
parts:
an
earlier
high
and
later
low
period
english-speaking
historians
following
their
german
counterparts
generally
subdivide
the
middle
ages
into
three
intervals:
early
high
and
late
in
the
th
century
the
entire
middle
ages
were
often
referred
to
as
the
dark
ages
but
with
the
adoption
of
these
subdivisions
use
of
this
term
was
restricted
to
the
early
middle
ages
at
least
among
historians
the
roman
empire
reached
its
greatest
territorial
extent
during
the
nd
century
ad
the
following
two
centuries
witnessed
the
slow
decline
of
roman
control
over
its
outlying
territories
economic
issues
including
inflation
and
external
pressure
on
the
frontiers
combined
to
create
the
crisis
of
the
third
century
with
emperors
coming
to
the
throne
only
to
be
rapidly
replaced
by
new
usurpers
military
expenses
increased
steadily
during
the
rd
century
mainly
in
response
to
the
war
with
the
sasanian
empire
which
revived
in
the
middle
of
the
rd
century
the
army
doubled
in
size
and
cavalry
and
smaller
units
replaced
the
roman
legion
as
the
main
tactical
unit
the
need
for
revenue
led
to
increased
taxes
and
a
decline
in
numbers
of
the
curial
or
landowning
class
and
decreasing
numbers
of
them
willing
to
shoulder
the
burdens
of
holding
office
in
their
native
towns
more
bureaucrats
were
needed
in
the
central
administration
to
deal
with
the
needs
of
the
army
which
led
to
complaints
from
civilians
that
there
were
more
tax-collectors
in
the
empire
than
tax-payers
the
emperor
diocletian
r
–
split
the
empire
into
separately
administered
eastern
and
western
halves
in
the
empire
was
not
considered
divided
by
its
inhabitants
or
rulers
as
legal
and
administrative
promulgations
in
one
division
were
considered
valid
in
the
other
in
after
a
period
of
civil
war
constantine
the
great
r
–
refounded
the
city
of
byzantium
as
the
newly
renamed
eastern
capital
constantinople
diocletian's
reforms
strengthened
the
governmental
bureaucracy
reformed
taxation
and
strengthened
the
army
which
bought
the
empire
time
but
did
not
resolve
the
problems
it
was
facing:
excessive
taxation
a
declining
birthrate
and
pressures
on
its
frontiers
among
others
civil
war
between
rival
emperors
became
common
in
the
middle
of
the
th
century
diverting
soldiers
from
the
empire's
frontier
forces
and
allowing
invaders
to
encroach
for
much
of
the
th
century
roman
society
stabilised
in
a
new
form
that
differed
from
the
earlier
classical
period
with
a
widening
gulf
between
the
rich
and
poor
and
a
decline
in
the
vitality
of
the
smaller
towns
another
change
was
the
christianisation
or
conversion
of
the
empire
to
christianity
a
gradual
process
that
lasted
from
the
nd
to
the
th
centuries

from

the

began
to

the
word
animal
comes
from
the
latin
animalis
meaning
having
breath
having
soul
or
living
being
the
biological
definition
includes
all
members
of
the
kingdom
animalia
in
colloquial
usage
as
a
consequence
of
anthropocentrism
the
term
animal
is
sometimes
used
nonscientifically
to
refer
only
to
non-human
animals
animals
have
several
characteristics
that
set
them
apart
from
other
living
things
animals
are
eukaryotic
and
multicellular
unlike
bacteria
which
are
prokaryotic
and
unlike
protists
which
are
eukaryotic
but
unicellular
unlike
plants
and
algae
which
produce
their
own
nutrients
animals
are
heterotrophic
feeding
on
organic
material
and
digesting
it
internally
with
very
few
exceptions
animals
breathe
oxygen
and
respire
aerobically
all
animals
are
motile
able
to
spontaneously
move
their
bodies
during
at
least
part
of
their
life
cycle
but
some
animals
such
as
sponges
corals
mussels
and
barnacles
later
become
sessile
the
blastula
is
a
stage
in
embryonic
development
that
is
unique
to
most
animals
allowing
cells
to
be
differentiated
into
specialised
tissues
and
organs
all
animals
are
composed
of
cells
surrounded
by
a
characteristic
extracellular
matrix
composed
of
collagen
and
elastic
glycoproteins
during
development
the
animal
extracellular
matrix
forms
a
relatively
flexible
framework
upon
which
cells
can
move
about
and
be
reorganised
making
the
formation
of
complex
structures
possible
this
may
be
calcified
forming
structures
such
as
shells
bones
and
spicules
in
contrast
the
cells
of
other
multicellular
organisms
primarily
algae
plants
and
fungi
are
held
in
place
by
cell
walls
and
so
develop
by
progressive
growth
animal
cells
uniquely
possess
the
cell
junctions
called
tight
junctions
gap
junctions
and
desmosomes
with
few
exceptions—in
particular
the
sponges
and
placozoans—animal
bodies
are
differentiated
into
tissues
these
include
muscles
which
enable
locomotion
and
nerve
tissues
which
transmit
signals
and
coordinate
the
body
typically
there
is
also
an
internal
digestive
chamber
with
either
one
opening
as
in
flatworms
or
two
in
its
most
narrow
usage
fiction
refers
to
novels
but
it
may
also
denote
any
literary
narrative
see
literary
fiction
including
novels
novellas
and
short
stories
more
broadly
fiction
has
come
to
encompass
imaginative
storytelling
in
any
format
including
writings
theatrical
performances
comics
films
television
programs
animations
games
most
notably
video
games
and
role-playing
games
and
so
on
a
work
of
fiction
implies
the
inventive
act
of
constructing
an
imaginary
world
so
its
audience
does
not
typically
expect
it
to
be
totally
faithful
to
the
real
world
in
presenting
only
characters
who
are
actual
people
or
descriptions
that
are
factually
true
instead
the
context
of
fiction
generally
understood
as
not
adhering
precisely
to
the
real
world
is
more
open
to
interpretation
characters
and
events
within
a
fictional
work
may
even
be
set
in
their
own
context
entirely
separate
from
the
known
universe:
an
independent
fictional
universe
fiction's
traditional
opposite
is
non-fiction
a
narrative
work
whose
creator
assumes
responsibility
for
presenting
only
the
historical
and
factual
truth
the
distinction
between
fiction
and
non-fiction
however
can
be
unclear
in
some
recent
artistic
and
literary
movements
such
as
postmodern
literature
traditionally
fiction
includes
novels
short
stories
fables
legends
myths
fairy
tales
epic
and
narrative
poetry
plays
including
operas
musicals
dramas
puppet
plays

the

has
had
a

the
combination
of

the

and
the
creativity
of
its
users
has
also
led
to
new
forms
of

countless

some

re-imagined
based
on
some
originally
true

or
a

often
even
when
the

is
based
on

there
may
be
additions
and
subtractions
from

to
make
it

about
the

fictional
works
that

the

consisted
of

in

script
discovered
in

rooms
in

some
dating
back
to

which
mainly
consisted
of
the
records
of

transactions
or
inventories
mark
the
end
of

and
the
start
of

things
were
much
the

in

and
temple
records
on

of
ancient

the
earliest
discovered
private
archives
were
kept
at
ugarit
besides
correspondence
and
inventories
texts
of
myths
may
have
been
standardized
practice-texts
for
teaching
new
scribes
there
is
also
evidence
of
libraries
at
nippur
about
bc
and
those
at
nineveh
about
bc
showing
a
library
classification
system
over
clay
tablets
from
the
library
of
ashurbanipal
have
been
discovered
at
nineveh
providing
modern
scholars
with
an
amazing
wealth
of
mesopotamian
literary
religious
and
administrative
work
among
the
findings
were
the
enuma
elish
also
known
as
the
epic
of
creation
which
depicts
a
traditional
babylonian
view
of
creation
the
epic
of
gilgamesh
a
large
selection
of
omen
texts
including
enuma
anu
enlil
which
contained
omens
dealing
with
the
moon
its
visibility
eclipses
and
conjunction
with
planets
and
fixed
stars
the
sun
its
corona
spots
and
eclipses
the
weather
namely
lightning
thunder
and
clouds
and
the
planets
and
their
visibility
appearance
and
stations
and
astronomic/astrological
texts
as
well
as
standard
lists
used
by
scribes
and
scholars
such
as
word
lists
bilingual
vocabularies
lists
of
signs
and
synonyms
and
lists
of
medical
diagnoses
the
tablets
were
stored
in
a
variety
of
containers
such
as
wooden
boxes
woven
baskets
of
reeds
or
clay
shelves
the
libraries
were
cataloged
using
colophons
which
are
a
publisher's
imprint
on
the
spine
of
a
book
or
in
this
case
a
tablet
the
colophons
stated
the
series
name
the
title
of
the
tablet
and
any
extra
information
the
scribe
needed
to
indicate
eventually
the
clay
tablets
were
organized
by
subject
and
size
unfortunately
due
to
limited
to
bookshelf
space
once
more
tablets
were
added
to
the
library
older
ones
were
removed
which
is
why
some
tablets
are
missing
from
the
excavated
cities
in
mesopotamia
according
to
legend
mythical
philosopher
laozi
was
keeper
of
books
in
the
earliest
library
in

which
belonged
to
the
imperial
zhou
dynasty
also
evidence
of
catalogues
found
in
some
destroyed
ancient
libraries
illustrates
the
presence
of
librarians
the
library
of
alexandria
in
egypt
was
the
largest
and
most
significant
great
library
of
the
ancient
world
it
flourished
under
the
patronage
of
the
ptolemaic
dynasty
and
functioned
as
a
major
center
of
scholarship
from
its
construction
in
the
rd
century
bc
until
the
roman
conquest
of
egypt
in
bc
the
library
was
conceived
and
opened
either
during
the
reign
of
ptolemy
i
soter
–
bc
or
during
the
reign
of
his
son
ptolemy
ii
–
bc
an
early
organization
system
was
in
effect
at
alexandria
the
great
library
of
alexandria
would
remain
as
the
intellectual
capital
of
the
western
world
during
the
rise
of
christianity
even
after
the
library
had
suffered
through
fires
and
conquest
this
great
library
was
more
than
a
place
to
hold
books
and
records
it
became
a
place
of
culture
the
alexandrian
book
collections
steadily
diminished
as
a

wittgenstein
was
probably
the
first
academic
philosopher
to
address
the
definition
of
the
word
game
in
his
philosophical
investigations
wittgenstein
argued
that
the
elements
of
games
such
as
play
rules
and
competition
all
fail
to
adequately
define
what
games
are
from
this
wittgenstein
concluded
that
people
apply
the
term
game
to
a
range
of
disparate
human
activities
that
bear
to
one
another
only
what
one
might
call
family
resemblances
as
the
following
game
definitions
show
this
conclusion
was
not
a
final
one
and
today
many
philosophers
like
thomas
hurka
think
that
wittgenstein
was
wrong
and
that
bernard
suits'
definition
is
a
good
answer
to
the
problem
french
sociologist
roger
caillois
in
his
book
les
jeux
et
les
hommes
games
and
men
defined
a
game
as
an
activity
that
must
have
the
following
characteristics:
fun:
the
activity
is
chosen
for
its
light-hearted
character
separate:
it
is
circumscribed
in
time
and
place
uncertain:
the
outcome
of
the
activity
is
unforeseeable
non-productive:
participation
does
not
accomplish
anything
useful
governed
by
rules:
the
activity
has
rules
that
are
different
from
everyday
life
fictitious:
it
is
accompanied
by
the
awareness
of
a
different
reality
computer
game
designer
chris
crawford
founder
of
the
journal
of
computer
game
design
has
attempted
to
define
the
term
game
using
a
series
of
dichotomies:
creative
expression
is
art
if
made
for
its
own
beauty
and
entertainment
if
made
for
money
a
piece
of
entertainment
is
a
plaything
if
it
is
interactive
movies
and
books
are
cited
as
examples
of
non-interactive
entertainment
if
no
goals
are
associated
with
a
plaything
it
is
a
toy
crawford
notes
that
by
his
definition
a
a
toy
can
become
a
game
element
if
the
player
makes
up
rules
and
b
the
sims
and
simcity
are
toys
not
games
if
it
has
goals
a
plaything
is
a
challenge
if
a
challenge
has
no
active
agent
against
whom
you
compete
it
is
a
puzzle
if
there
is
one
it
is
a
conflict
crawford
admits
that
this
is
a
subjective
test
video
games
with
noticeably
algorithmic
artificial
intelligence
can
be
played
as
puzzles
these
include
the
patterns
used
to
evade
ghosts
in
pac-man
finally
if
the
player
can
only
outperform
the
opponent
but
not
attack
them
to
interfere
with
their
performance
the
conflict
is
a
competition
competitions
include
racing
and
figure
skating
however
if
attacks
are
allowed
then
the
conflict
qualifies
as
a
game
crawford's
definition
may
thus
be
rendered
as:
an
interactive
goal-oriented
activity
made
for
money
with
active
agents
to
play
against
in
which
players
including
active
agents
can
interfere
with
each
other
a
game
is
a
system
in
which
players
engage
in
an
artificial
conflict
defined
by
rules
that
results
in
a
quantifiable
outcome

a
game
is
a
form
of
art
in
which

tokens
in

greg

according
to
this
definition
some
games
that
do
not
involve
choices
such
as
chutes
and
ladders
candy
land
and
war
are
not
technically
games
any
more
than
a
slot
machine
is
a
game
is
an
activity
among
two
or
more
independent
decision-makers
seeking
to
achieve
their
objectives
in
some
limiting
context

define
game
as
an
exercise
of
voluntary

there
is
an
opposition

to

a
game
is
to
engage
in
activity
directed
toward
bringing
about
a
specific
state
of
affairs
using
only
means
permitted
by
specific
rules
where
the
means
permitted
by
the
rules
are
more
limited
in

than
they
would
be
in
the
absence
of

and
where
the
sole
reason
for
accepting
such
limitation
is
to
make
possible
such
activity

the

and

all
games
share
four
defining
traits:
a
goal
rules
a
feedback
system
and
voluntary
participation
jane
mcgonigal
games
can
be
characterized
by
what
the
player
does
this
is
often
referred
to
as
gameplay
major
key
elements
identified
in
this
context
are
tools
and
rules
that
define
the
overall
context
of
game
games
are
often
classified
by
the
components
required
to
play
them
e
g
miniatures
a
ball
cards
a
board
and
pieces
or
a
computer
in
places
where
the
use
of
leather
is
well-established
the
ball
has
been
a
popular
game
piece
throughout
recorded
history
resulting
in
a
worldwide
popularity
of
ball
games
such
as
rugby
basketball
soccer
football
cricket
tennis
and
volleyball
other
tools
are
more
idiosyncratic
to
a
certain
region
many
countries
in
europe
for
instance
have
unique
standard
decks
of
playing
cards
other
games
such
as
chess
may
be
traced
primarily
through
the
development
and
evolution
of
its
game
pieces
many
game
tools
are
tokens
meant
to
represent
other
things
a
token
may
be
a
pawn
on
a
board
play
money
or
an
intangible
item
such
as
a
point
scored
games
such
as
hide-and-seek
or
tag
do
not
use
any
obvious
tool
rather
their
interactivity
is
defined
by
the
environment
games
with
the
same
or
similar
rules
may
have
different
gameplay
if
the
environment
is
altered
for
example
hide-and-seek
in
a
school
building
differs
from
the
same
game
in
a
park
an
auto
race
can
be
radically
different
depending
on
the
track
or
street
course
even
with
the
same
cars
whereas
games
are
often
characterized
by
their
tools
they
are
often
defined
by
their
rules
while
rules
are
subject
to
variations
and
changes
enough
change
in
the
rules
usually
results
in
a
new
game
for
instance
baseball
can
be
played
with
real
baseballs
or
with
wiffleballs
however
if
the
players
decide
to
play
with
only
three
bases
they
are
arguably
playing
a
different
game
there
are
exceptions
to
this
in
that
some
games
deliberately
involve
the
changing
of
their
own
rules
but
even
then
there
are
often
immutable
meta-rules
rules
generally
determine
the
time-keeping
system
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
the
players
and
each
player's
goals
player
rights
may
include
when
they
may
spend
resources
or
move
tokens
common
win
conditions
are
being
first
to
amass
a
certain
quota
of
points
or
tokens
as
in
settlers
of
catan
having
the
greatest
number
of
tokens
at
the
end
of
the
game
as
in
monopoly
or
some
relationship
of
one's
game
tokens
to
those
of
one's
opponent
as
in
chess's
checkmate
a
game's
tools
and
rules
will
result
in
its
requiring
skill
strategy
luck
or
a
combination
thereof
and
are
classified
accordingly
games
of
skill
include
games
of
physical
skill
such
as
wrestling
tug
of
war
hopscotch
target
shooting
and
stake
and
games
of
mental
skill
such
as
checkers
and
chess
games
of
strategy
include
checkers
chess
go
arimaa
and
tic-tac-toe
and
often
require
special
equipment
to
play
them
games
of
chance
include
gambling
games
blackjack
mahjong
roulette
etc
as
well
as
snakes
and
ladders
and
rock
paper
scissors
most
require
equipment
such
as
cards
or
dice
however
most
games
contain
two
or
all
three
of
these
elements
for
example
american
football
and
baseball
involve
both
physical
skill
and
strategy
while
tiddlywinks
poker
and
monopoly
combine
strategy
and
chance
many
card
and
board
games
combine
all
three
most
trick-taking
games
involve
mental
skill
strategy
and
an
element
of
chance
as
do
many
strategic
board
games
such
as
risk
settlers
of
catan
and
carcassonne
most
games
require
multiple
players
however
single-player
games
are
unique
in
respect
to
the
type
of
challenges
a
player
faces
unlike
a
game
with
multiple
players
competing
with
or
against
each
other
to
reach
the
game's
goal
a
one-player
game
is
a
battle
solely
against
an
element
of
the
environment
an
artificial
opponent
against
one's
own
skills
against
time
or
against
chance
playing
with
a
yo-yo
or
playing
tennis
against
a
wall
is
not
generally
recognized
as
playing
a
game
due
to
the
lack
of
any
formidable
opposition
many
games
described
as
single-player
may
be
termed
actually
puzzles
or
recreations
a
multiplayer
game
is
a
game
of
several
players
who
may
be
independent
opponents
or
teams
games
with
many
independent
players
are
difficult
to
analyze
formally
using
game
theory
as
the
players
may
form
and
switch
coalitions
the
term
game
in
this
context
may
mean
either
a
true
game
played
for
entertainment
or
a
competitive
activity
describable
in
principle
by
mathematical
game
theory
john
nash
proved
that
games
with
several
players
have
a
stable
solution
provided
that
coalitions
between
players
are
disallowed
nash
won
the
nobel
prize
for
economics
for
this
important
result
which
extended
von
neumann's
theory
of
zero-sum
games
early
games
used
interactive
electronic
devices
with
various
display
formats
the
earliest
example
is
from
—a
cathode
ray
tube
amusement
device
was
filed
for
a
patent
on
january
by
thomas
t
goldsmith
jr
and
estle
ray
mann
and
issued
on
december
as
patent
inspired
by
radar
display
technology
it
consisted
of
an
analog
device
that
allowed
a
user
to
control
a
vector-drawn
dot
on
the
screen
to
simulate
a
missile
being
fired
at
targets
which
were

space
created
by
nolan
bushnell
and
ted
dabney
was
the
first
commercially
sold
coin-operated
video
game
it
used
a
black-and-white
television
for
its
display
and
the
computer
system
was
made
of
series
ttl

the
game
was
featured
in
the
science

soylent
green
computer
space
was
followed
in
by
the
magnavox

the
first
home

modeled
after
a
late
prototype
console
developed
by
ralph
h
baer
called
the
brown
box
it
also
used
a
standard
television
these
were
followed
by
two
versions
of
atari's
pong
an
arcade
version
in
and
a
home
version
in
that
dramatically
increased
video
game
popularity
the
commercial
success
of
pong
led
numerous
other
companies
to
develop
pong
clones
and
their
own
systems
spawning
the
video
game
industry
a
flood
of
pong
clones
eventually
led
to
the
video
game
crash
of
which
came
to
an
end
with
the
mainstream
success
of
taito's
shooter
game
space
invaders
marking
the
beginning
of
the
golden
age
of
arcade
video
games
and
inspiring
dozens
of
manufacturers
to
enter
the
market
the
game
inspired
arcade
machines
to
become
prevalent
in
mainstream
locations
such
as
shopping
malls
traditional
storefronts
restaurants
and
convenience
stores
the
game
also
became
the
subject
of
numerous
articles
and
stories
on
television
and
in
newspapers
and
magazines
establishing
video
gaming
as
a
rapidly
growing
mainstream
hobby
space
invaders
was
soon
licensed
for
the
atari
vcs
later
known
as
atari
becoming
the
first
killer
app
and
quadrupling
the
console's
sales
this
helped
atari
recover
from
their
earlier
losses
and
in
turn
the
atari
vcs
revived
the
home
video
game
market
during
the
second
generation
of
consoles
up
until
the
north
american
video
game
crash
of
the
home
video
game
industry
was
revitalized
shortly
afterwards
by
the
widespread
success
of
the
nintendo
entertainment
system
which
marked
a
shift
in
the
dominance
of
the
video
game
industry
from
the
united
states
to
japan
during
the
third
generation
of
consoles
the
term
platform
refers
to
the
specific
combination
of
electronic
components
or
computer
hardware
which
in
conjunction
with
software
allows
a
video
game
to
operate
the
term
system
is
also
commonly
used
the
distinctions
below
are
not
always
clear
and
there
may
be
games
that
bridge
one
or
more
platforms
in
addition
to
laptop/desktop
computers
and
mobile
devices
there
are
other
devices
which
have
the
ability

but
are
not

a
pc
game
refers
to
a
form
of
media
that
involves
a
player
interacting
with
a
personal
computer
connected
to
a
video
monitor
by
the
late
th
century
the
cambridge
region
already
had
a
scholarly
and
ecclesiastical
reputation
due
to
monks
from
the
nearby
bishopric
church
of
ely
however
it
was
an
incident
at
oxford
which
is
most
likely
to
have
formed
the
establishment
of
the
university:
two
oxford
scholars
were
hanged
by
the
town
authorities
for
the
death
of
a
woman
without
consulting
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
who
would
normally
take
precedence
and
pardon
the
scholars
in
such
a
case
but
were
at
that
time
in
conflict
with
king
john
the
university
of
oxford
went
into
suspension
in
protest
and
most
scholars
moved
to
cities
such
as
paris
reading
and
cambridge
after
the
university
of
oxford
reformed
several
years
later
enough
scholars
remained
in
cambridge
to
form
the
nucleus
of
the
new
university
in
order
to
claim
precedence
it
is
common
for
cambridge
to
trace
its
founding
to
the
charter
from
king
henry
iii
granting
it
the
right
to
discipline
its
own
members
ius
non-trahi
extra
and
an
exemption
from
some
taxes
oxford
would
not
receive
a
similar
enhancement
until
a
bull
in
from
pope
gregory
ix
gave
graduates
from
cambridge
the
right
to
teach
everywhere
in
christendom
after
cambridge
was
described
as
a
studium
generale
in
a
letter
by
pope
nicholas
iv
in
and
confirmed
as
such
in
a
bull
by
pope
john
xxii
in
it
became
common
for
researchers
from
other
european
medieval
universities
to
visit
cambridge
to
study
or
to
give
lecture
courses
the
colleges
at
the
university
of
cambridge
were
originally
an
incidental
feature
of
the
system
no
college
is
as
old
as
the
university
itself
the
colleges
were
endowed
fellowships
of
scholars
there
were
also
institutions
without
endowments
called
hostels
the
hostels
were
gradually
absorbed
by
the
colleges
over
the
centuries
but
they
have
left
some
indications
of
their
existence
such
as
the
name
of
garret
hostel
lane
hugh
balsham
bishop
of
ely
founded
peterhouse
cambridge's
first
college
in
many
colleges
were
founded
during
the
th
and
th
centuries
but
colleges
continued
to
be
established
until
modern
times
although
there
was
a
gap
of
years
between
the
founding
of
sidney
sussex
in
and
that

the
most
recently
established

however
homerton
college
only
achieved
full
university
college
status
in
march
making
it
the
newest
full
college
it
was
previously
an
approved
society
affiliated
with
the
university
in
medieval
times
many
colleges
were
founded
so
that
their
members
would
pray
for
the
souls
of
the
founders
and
were
often
associated
with
chapels
or
abbeys
a
change
in
the
colleges'
focus
occurred
in
with
the
dissolution
of
the
monasteries
king
henry
viii
ordered
the
university
to
disband
its
faculty
of
canon
law
and
to
stop
teaching
scholastic
philosophy
in
response
colleges
changed
their
curricula
away
from
canon
law
and
towards
the
classics
the
bible
and
mathematics
nearly
a
century
later
the
university
was
at
the
centre
of
a
protestant
schism
many
nobles
intellectuals
and
even
commoners
saw
the
ways
of
the
church
of
england
as
being
too
similar
to
the
catholic
church
and
felt
that
it
was
used
by
the
crown
to
usurp
the
rightful
powers
of
the
counties
east
anglia
was
the
centre
of
what
became
the
puritan
movement
at
cambridge
it
was
particularly
strong
at
emmanuel
st
catharine's
hall
sidney
sussex
and
christ's
college
they
produced
many
non-conformist
graduates
who
greatly
influenced
by
social
position
or
pulpit
the
approximately
puritans
who
left
for
new

and
especially
the

from
the
time
of

in
the
later
th
century
until
the
mid-th

the

maintained
an
especially
strong
emphasis
on

the

is
known
as
a

tripos
are
termed
wranglers
and

students
such
as
g
h
hardy
disliked
the
system
feeling
that
people
were
too
interested
in
accumulating
marks
in
exams
and
not
interested
in
the
subject
itself
pure
mathematics
at
cambridge
in
the
th
century
had
great
achievements
but
also
missed
out
on
substantial
developments
in
french
and
german
mathematics
pure
mathematical
research
at
cambridge
finally
reached
the
highest
international
standard
in
the
early
th
century
thanks
above
all
to
g
h
hardy
his
collaborator
j
e
littlewood
and
srinivasa
ramanujan
in
geometry
w
v
d
hodge
brought
cambridge
into
the
international
mainstream
in
the
although
diversified
in
its
research
and
teaching
interests
cambridge
today
maintains
its
strength
in
mathematics
cambridge
alumni
have
won
six
fields
medals
and
one
abel
prize
for
mathematics
while
individuals
representing
cambridge
have
won
four
fields
medals
after
the
cambridge
university
act
formalised
the
organizational
structure
of
the
university
the
study
of
many
new
subjects
was
introduced
such
as
theology
history
and
modern
languages
resources
necessary
for
new
courses
in
the
arts
architecture
and
archaeology
were
donated
by
viscount
fitzwilliam
of
trinity
college
who
also
founded
the
fitzwilliam
museum
between
and
downing
college
sold
part
of
its
land
to
build
the
downing
site
comprising
new
scientific
laboratories
for
anatomy
genetics
and
earth
sciences
during
the
same
period
the
new
museums
site
was
erected
including
the
cavendish
laboratory
which
has
since
moved
to
the
west
cambridge
site
and
other
departments
for
chemistry
and
medicine
the
university
of
cambridge
began
to
award
phd
degrees
in
the
first
third
of
the
th
century
the
first
cambridge
phd
in
mathematics
was
awarded
in
in
the
first
world
war
members
of
the
university
served
and
were
killed
teaching
and
the
fees
it
earned
came
almost
to
a
stop
and
severe
financial
difficulties
followed
as
a
consequence
the
university
first
received
systematic
state
support
in
and
a
royal
commission
appointed
in
recommended
that
the
university
but
not
the
colleges
should
receive
an
annual
grant
following
the
second
world
war
the
university
saw
a
rapid
expansion
of
student
numbers
and
available
places
this
was
partly
due
to
the
success
and
popularity
gained
by
many
cambridge
scientists
the
university
was
one
of
only
two
universities
to
hold
parliamentary
seats
in
the
parliament
of
england
and
was
later
one
of
eight
represented
in
the
parliament
of
the
united
kingdom
the
constituency
was
created
by
a
royal
charter
of
and
returned
two
members
of
parliament
until
when
it
was
abolished
by
the
representation
of
the
people
act
the
constituency
was
not
a
geographical
area
its
electorate
consisted
of
the
graduates
of
the
university
before
the
franchise
was
restricted
to
male
graduates
with
a
doctorate
or
ma
degree
for
many
years
only
male
students
were
enrolled
into
the
university
the
first
colleges
for
women
were
girton
college
founded
by
emily
davies
in
and
newnham
college
in
founded
by
anne
clough
and

edwards
college
founded
by
rosemary
murray
as
new

in
and
lucy
cavendish
college
in
the
first
women
students
were
examined
in
but
attempts
to
make
women
full
members
of
the
university
did
not
succeed
until
women
were
allowed
to
study
courses
sit
examinations
and
have
their
results
recorded
from
for
a
brief
period
after
the
turn
of
the
twentieth
century
this
allowed
the
steamboat
ladies
to
receive
ad
eundem
degrees
from
the
university
of
dublin
from
women
were
awarded
diplomas
which
conferred
the
title
of
the
degree
of
bachelor
of
arts
as
they
were
not
admitted
to
the
degree
of
bachelor
of
arts
they
were
excluded
from
the
governing
of
the
university
since
students
must
belong
to
a
college
and
since
established
colleges
remained
closed
to
women
women
found
admissions
restricted
to
colleges
established
only
for
women
darwin
college
the
first
wholly
graduate
college
of
the
university
matriculated
both
men
and
women
students
from
its
inception
in
–
and
elected
a
mixed
fellowship
of
the
undergraduate
colleges
starting
with
churchill
clare
and
king's
colleges
the
former
men's
colleges
began
to
admit
women
between
and
one
of
the
female-only
colleges
girton
also
began
to
admit
male
students
from
but
the
other
female-only
colleges
did
not
do
likewise
as
a
result
of
st
hilda's
college
oxford
ending
its
ban
on
male
students
in
cambridge
is
now
the
only
remaining
united
kingdom
university
with
female-only
colleges
newnham
murray
edwards
and
lucy
cavendish
in
the
academic
year
–
the
university's
student
sex
ratio
including
post-graduates
was
male
:
female
as
an
institution
with
such
a
long
history
the
university
has
developed
a
large
number
of
myths
and
legends
the
vast
majority
of
these
are
untrue
but
have
been
propagated
nonetheless
by
generations
of
students
and
tour
guides
a
discontinued
tradition
is
that
of
the
wooden
spoon
the
'prize'
awarded
to
the
student
with
the
lowest
passing
honours
grade
in
the
final
examinations
of
the
mathematical
tripos
the
last
of
these
spoons
was
awarded
in
to
cuthbert
lempriere
holthouse
an
oarsman
of
the
lady
margaret
boat
club
of
st
john's
college
it
was
over
one
metre
in
length
and
had
an
oar
blade
for
a
handle
it
can
now
be
seen
outside
the
senior
combination
room
of
st
john's
since
examination
results
have
been
published
alphabetically
within
class
rather
than
in
strict
order
of
merit
this
made
it
harder
to
ascertain
who
was
entitled
to
the
spoon
unless
there
was
only
one
person
in
the
third
class
and
so
the
practice
was
abandoned
each
christmas
eve
bbc
radio
and
television
broadcasts
the
festival
of
nine
lessons
and
carols
sung
by
the
choir
of
king's
college
cambridge
the
radio
broadcast
has
been
a
national
christmas
tradition
since
it
was
first
transmitted
in
though
the
festival
has
existed
since
the
radio
broadcast
is
carried
worldwide
by
the
bbc
world
service
and
is
also
syndicated
to
hundreds
of
radio
stations
in
the
us
the
first
television
broadcast
of
the
festival
was
in
the
university
occupies
a
central
location
within
the
city
of
cambridge
with
the
students
taking
up
a
significant
proportion
nearly
of
the
town's
population
and
heavily
affecting
the
age
structure
most
of
the
older
colleges
are
situated
nearby
the
city
centre
and
river
cam
along
which
it
is
traditional
to
punt
to
appreciate
the
buildings
and
surroundings
examples
of
notable
buildings
include
king's
college
chapel
the
history
faculty
building
designed
by
james
stirling
and
the
cripps
building
at
st
john's
college
the
brickwork
of
several
of
the
colleges
is
also
notable:
queens'
college
contains
some
of
the
earliest
patterned
brickwork
in
the
country
and
the
brick
walls
of
st
john's
college
provide
examples
of
english
bond
flemish
bond
and
running
bond
the
university
is
divided
into
several
sites
where
the
different
departments
are
placed
the
main
ones
are:
the
university's
school
of
clinical
medicine
is
based
in
addenbrooke's
hospital
where
students
in
medicine
undergo
their
three-year
clinical
placement
period
after
obtaining
their
ba
degree
while
the
west
cambridge
site
is
undergoing
a
major
expansion
and
will
host
a
new
sports
development
in
addition
the
judge
business
school
situated
on
trumpington
street
provides
management
education
courses
since
and
is
consistently
ranked
within
the
top
business
schools
globally
by
the
financial
times
given
that
the
sites
are
in
relative
close
proximity
to
each
other
and
the
area
around
cambridge
is
reasonably
flat
one
of
the
favourite
modes
of
transport
for
students
is
the
bicycle:
a
fifth
of
the
journeys
in
the
city
are
made
by
bike
a
figure
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
students
are
not
permitted
to
hold
car
park
permits
except
under
special
circumstances
the
relationship
between
the
university
and
the
city
has
not
always
been
positive
the
phrase
town
and
gown
is
employed
to
differentiate
inhabitants
of
cambridge
from
students
at
the
university
who
historically
wore
academical
dress
there
are
many
stories
of
ferocious
rivalry
between
the
two
categories:
in
strong
clashes
brought
about
attacks
and
looting
of
university
properties
while
locals
contested
the
privileges
granted
by
the
government
to
the
academic
staff
following
these
events
the
chancellor
was
given
special
powers
allowing
him
to
prosecute
the
criminals
and
re-establish
order
in
the
city
attempts
to
reconcile
the
two
groups
followed
over
time
and
in
the
th
century
agreements
were
signed
to
improve
the
quality
of
streets
and
student
accommodation
around
the
city
however
this
was
followed
by
new
confrontations
when
the
plague
hit
cambridge
in
and
colleges
refused
to
help
those
affected
by
the
disease
by
locking
their
sites
nowadays
these
conflicts
have
somewhat
subsided
and
the
university
has
become
an
opportunity
for
employment
among
the
population
providing
an
increased
level
of
wealth
in
the
area
the
enormous
growth
in
the
number
of
high-tech
biotech
providers
of
services
and
related
firms
situated
near
cambridge
has
been
termed
the
cambridge
phenomenon:
the
addition
of
new
registered
companies
and
as
many
as
jobs
between
and
has
been
directly
related
to
the
presence
and
importance
of
the
university
cambridge
is
a
collegiate
university
meaning
that
it
is
made
up
of
self-governing
and
independent
colleges
each
with
its
own
property
and
income
most
colleges
bring
together
academics
and
students
from
a
broad
range
of
disciplines
and
within
each
faculty
school
or
department
within
the
university
academics
from
many
different
colleges
will
be
found
the
faculties
are
responsible
for
ensuring
that
lectures
are
given
arranging
seminars
performing
research
and
determining
the
syllabi
for
teaching
overseen
by
the
general
board
together
with
the
central
administration
headed
by
the
vice-chancellor
they
make
up
the
entire
cambridge
university
facilities
such
as
libraries
are
provided
on
all
these
levels:
by
the
university
the
cambridge
university
library
by
the
faculties
faculty
libraries
such
as
the
squire
law
library
and
by
the
individual
colleges
all
of
which
maintain
a
multi-discipline
library
generally
aimed
mainly
at
their
undergraduates
the
colleges
are
self-governing
institutions
with
their
own
endowments
and
property
founded
as
integral
parts
of
the
university
all
students
and
most
academics
are
attached
to
a
college
their
importance
lies
in
the
housing
welfare
social
functions
and
undergraduate
teaching
they
provide
all
faculties
departments
research
centres
and
laboratories
belong
to
the
university
which
arranges
lectures
and
awards
degrees
but
undergraduates
receive
their
supervisions—small-group
teaching
sessions
often
with
just
one
student—within
the
colleges
though
in
many
cases
students
go
to
other
colleges
for
supervision
if
the
teaching
fellows
at
their
college
do
not
specialise
in
the
areas
concerned
each
college
appoints
its
own
teaching
staff
and
fellows
who
are
also
members
of
a
university
department
the
colleges
also
decide
which
undergraduates
to
admit
to
the
university
in
accordance
with
university
regulations
cambridge
has
colleges
of
which
three
murray
edwards
newnham
and
lucy
cavendish
admit
women
only
the
other
colleges
are
mixed
though
most
were
originally
all-male
darwin

the
first
college
to
admit
both

all
other

with
no
age
restrictions
colleges
are
not
required
to
admit
students
in
all
subjects
with
some
colleges
choosing
not
to
offer
subjects
such
as
architecture
history
of
art
or
theology
but
most
offer
close
to
the
complete
range
some
colleges
maintain
a
bias
towards
certain
subjects
for
example
with
churchill
leaning
towards
the
sciences
and
engineering
while
others
such
as
st
catharine's
aim
for
a
balanced
intake
others
maintain
much
more
informal
reputations
such
as
for
the
students
of
king's
to
hold
left-wing
political
views
or
robinson's
and
churchill's
attempts
to
minimise
their
environmental
impact
costs
to
students
accommodation
and
food
prices
vary
considerably
from
college
to

similarly
college
expenditure
on
student
education
also
varies
widely
between
