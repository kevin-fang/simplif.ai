under
which
is
high
the
united
states
is
a
federal
republic
the
federal
government
of
the
united
states
is
set
up
by
the
constitution
there
are
three
branches
they
are
the
executive
branch
the
legislative
branch
and
the
judicial
branch
state
governments
and
the
federal
government
work
in
very
similar
ways
each
state
has
its
own
executive
legislative
and
judicial
branches
the
executive
branch
of
a
state
government
is
led
by
a
governor
instead
of
a
president
the
executive
branch
is
the
part
of
the
government
that
enforces
the
law
members
of
the
electoral
college
elect
a
president
who
is
the
leader
of
the
executive
branch
as
well
as
the
leader
of
the
armed
forces
the
president
may
veto
a
bill
that
the
congress
has
passed
so
it
does
not
become
a
law
the
president
may
also
make
executive
orders
to
ensure
that
people
follow
the
law
the
president
is
in
charge
of
many
departments
that
control
much
of
the
day-to-day
actions
of
government
for
example
department
of
commerce
makes
rules
about
trade
the
president
chooses
the
heads
of
these
departments
and
also
nominates
federal
judges
however
the
senate
part
of
the
legislative
branch
must
agree
with
all
of
the
people
the
president
chooses
the
president
may
serve
two
-year
terms
the
legislative
branch
makes
laws
the
legislative
branch
is
called
the
united
states
congress
congress
is
divided
into
two
houses
one
house
is
the
house
of
representatives
the
representatives
are
each
elected
by
voters
from
a
set
area
within
a
state
the
number
of
representatives
a
state
has
is
based
on
how
many
people
live
there
representatives
serve
two-year
terms
the
total
number
of
representatives
today
is
the
leader
of
the
house
of
representatives
is
the
speaker
of
the
house
the
other
house
is
the
senate
in
the
senate
each
state
is
represented
equally
by
two
senators
because
there
are
states
there
are
senators
the
president's
treaties
or
appointments
of
officials
need
the
senate's
approval
senators
serve
six-year
terms
the
vice
president
of
the
united
states
serves
as
president
of
the
senate
in
practice
the
vice
president
is
usually
absent
from
the
senate
and
a
senator
serves
as
president
pro
tempore
or
temporary
president
of
the
senate
representatives
and
senators
propose
laws
called
bills
in
their
respective
houses
a
bill
may
be
voted
upon
by
the
entire
house
right
away
or
may
first
go
to
a
small
group
known
as
a
committee
which
may
recommend
a
bill
for
a
vote
by
the
whole
house
if
one
house
votes
to
pass
a
bill
the
bill
then
gets
sent
to
the
other
house
if
both
houses
vote
for
it
it
is
then
sent
to
the
president
who
may
sign
the
bill
into
law
or
veto
it
if
the
president
vetoes
the
bill
it
is
sent
back
to
congress
if
congress
votes
again
and
passes
the
bill
with
at
least
a
two-thirds
majority
the
bill
becomes
law
and
cannot
be
vetoed
by
the
president
under
the
american
system
of
federalism
congress
may
not
make
laws
that
directly
control
the
states
instead
congress
may
use
the
promise
of
federal
funds
or
special
circumstances
such
as
national
emergencies
to
encourage
the
states
to
follow
federal
law
this
system
is
both
complex
and
unique
the
judicial
branch
is
the
part
of
government
that
interprets
what
the
law
means
the
judicial
branch
is
made
up
of
the
supreme
court
and
many
lower
courts
if
the
supreme
court
decides
that
a
law
is
not
allowed
by
the
constitution
the
law
is
said
to
be
struck
down
and
is
no
longer
a
valid
law
the
supreme
court
is
made
up
of
nine
judges
called
justices
who
are
nominated
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate
one
of
these
justices
called
the
chief
justice
heads
the
court
a
supreme
court
justice
serves
until
he
or
she
dies
or
resigns
quits
in
the
middle
of
his
or
her
term
when
that
happens
the
president
nominates
someone
new
to
replace
the
justice
who
left
if
the
senate
agrees
with
that
choice
the
person
becomes
a
justice
if
the
senate
does
not
agree
with
the
president's
choice
then
the
president
must
nominate
someone
else
famous
court
cases
such
as
marbury
v
madison
which
was
decided
in
have
firmly
established
that
the
supreme
court
is
the
ultimate
interpreter
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
has
the
power
to
strike
down
any
law
that
conflicts
with
it
the
united
states
of
america
consists
of
states
territories
and
district
washington
d
c
states
can
make
laws
about
things
inside
the
state
but
federal
law
is
about
things
dealing
with
more
than
one
state
or
dealing
with
other
countries
in
some
areas
if
the
federal
government
makes
laws
that
say
different
things
from
the
state
laws
people
must
follow
the
federal
law
because
the
state
law
is
not
a
law
any
more
each
state
has
a
constitution
of
its
own
different
from
the
federal
national
constitution
each
of
these
is
like
the
federal
constitution
because
they
say
how
each
state's
government
is
set
up
but
some
also
talk
about
specific
laws
the
federal
and
most
state
governments
are
dominated
by
two
political
parties:
the
republicans
and
the
democrats
there
are
many
smaller
parties
the
largest
of
these
are
the
libertarian
party
and
the
green
party
people
help
in
political
campaigns
that
they
like
they
try
to
persuade
politicians
to
help
them
this
is
called
lobbying
all
americans
are
allowed
to
do
these
things
but
some
have
and
spend
more
money
than
others
or
in
other
ways
do
more
in
politics
some
people
think
this
is
a
problem
and
lobby
for
rules
to
be
made
to
change
it
since
the
president
is
a
republican
and
congress
is
also
republican-controlled
so
the
republicans
have
more
power
in
the
federal
government
there
are
still
many
powerful
democrats
who
can
try
to
stop
the
republicans
from
doing
things
that
they
believe
will
be
bad
for
the
country
also
members
of
a
party
in
power
do
not
always
agree
on
what
to
do
if
enough
people
decide
to
vote
against
republicans
in
the
next
election
they
will
lose
power
in
a
republic
like
the
united
states
no
party
can
do
whatever
they
want
all
politicians
have
to
argue
compromise
and
make
deals
with
each
other
to
get
things
done
they
have
to
answer
to
the
people
and
take
responsibility
for
their
mistakes
the
usa's
large
cultural
economic
and
military
influence
has
made
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
or
relations
with
other
countries
a
topic
in
american
politics
and
the
politics
of
many
other
countries
the
united
states
conquered
and
bought
new
lands
over
time
and
grew
from
the
original
colonies
in
the
east
to
the
current
states
of
which
of
them
are
joined
together
to
make
up
the
contiguous
united
states
these
states
called
the
lower

all
be
reached
by
road
without
crossing
a
border
into
another
country
they
go
from
the
atlantic
east
to
the

there
are
two
other
states
which
are
not
joined
to
the

the
world
especially
the
western
world
american
music
is
heard
all
over
the
world
and
american
movies
and
television
shows
can
be
seen
in
most
countries
the
american
flag
is
made
up
of
stars
on
a
blue
background
and
has
stripes
seven
red
and
six
white
it
is
one
of
many
symbols
of
the
united
states
like
the
bald
eagle
the
stars
represent
the
states
the
red
stands
for
courage
the
blue
stands
for
justice
the
white
represents
peace
and
cleanliness
the
stripes
represent
the
original
colonies
one
of
the
differences
between
using
bitcoin
and
using
regular
money
online
is
that
bitcoin
can
be
used
without
having
an
internet
connection
to
link
any
sort
of
real-world
identity
to
it
unless
someone
chooses
to
link
their
name
to
a
bitcoin
address
it
is
hard
to
tell
who
owns
the
address
bitcoin
does
not
keep
track
of
users
it
keeps
track
of
addresses
where
the
money
is
each
address
has
two
important
pieces
of
cryptographic
information
or
keys:
a
public
one
and
a
private
one
the
public
key
which
is
what
the
bitcoin
address
is
created
from
is
similar
to
an
email
address
anyone
can
look
it
up
and
send
bitcoins
to
it
the
private
address
or
private
key
is
similar
to
an
email
password
only
with
it
can
the
owner
send
bitcoins
from
it
because
of
this
it
is
very
important
that
this
private
key
is
kept
secret
to
send
bitcoins
from
an
address
you
prove
to
the
network
that
you
own
the
private
key
that
corresponds
to
the
address
without
revealing
the
private
key
this
is
done
with
a
branch
of
mathematics
known
as
public
key
cryptography
a
public
key
is
what
determines
the
ownership
of
bitcoins
and
is
very
similar
to
an
id
number
if
someone
wanted
to
send
you
bitcoins
all
you
would
need
to
do
is
supply
them
your
bitcoin
address
which
is
a
version
of
your
public
key
that
is
easier
to
read
and
type
for
example
if
bob
has
bitcoin
at
the
bitcoin
address
abc
and
alice
has
no
bitcoins
at
the
bitcoin
address
def
bob
can
send
bitcoins
to
def
as
soon
as
the
transaction
is
processed
alice
and
bob
both
have
bitcoins
anyone
using
the
system
can
see
how
much
money
abc
has
and
how
much
money
def
has
but
they
cannot
tell
anything
about
who
owns
the
address
in
the
example
above
abc
and
def
are
the
bitcoin
addresses
of
bob
and
alice
but
bob
and
alice
each
have
a
second
key
which
only
they
individually
know
this
is
the
private
key
and
it
is
the
other
half
of
a
bitcoin
address
the
private
key
is
never
shared
and
allows
the
owner
of
the
bitcoins
to
control
them
however
if
the
private
key
is
not
kept
secret
then
anyone
who
sees
it
can
also
control
and
take
the
bitcoins
there
this
happened
on
live
tv
when
bloomberg's
matt
miller
accidentally
showed
a
private
key
to
viewers
the
money
was
taken
immediately
the
person
who
took
it
told
others
about
it
later
saying
i'll
send
it
back
once
matt
gives
me
a
new
address
since
someone
else
can
sweep
[empty]
out
the
old
one
sites
or
users
using
the
bitcoin
system
are
required
to
use
a
global
database
called
the
blockchain
the
blockchain
is
a
record
of
all
transactions
that
have
taken
place
in
the
bitcoin
network
it
also
keeps
track
of
new
bitcoins
as
they
are
generated
with
these
two
facts
the
blockchain
can
keep
track
of
who
has
how
much
money
at
all
times
to
generate
a
bitcoin
a
miner
must
solve
a
math
problem
however
the
difficulty
of
the
math
problem
depends
on
how
many
people
are
mining
for
bitcoin
at
the
moment
because
of
how
complicated
the
math
problems
usually
are
they
must
be
calculated
with
very
powerful
processors
these
processors
can
be
found
in
cpus
graphics
cards
or
specialized
machines
called
asics
the
process
of
generating
the
bitcoins
is
called
mining
people
who
use
these
machines
to
mine
bitcoins
are
called
miners
miners
either
compete
with
one
another
or
work
together
in
groups
to
solve
a
mathematical
puzzle
the
first
miner
or
group
of
miners
to
solve
the
particular
puzzle
are
rewarded
with
new
bitcoins
the
puzzle
is
determined
by
the
transactions
being
sent
at
the
time
and
the
previous
puzzle
solution
this
means
the
solution
to
one
puzzle
is
always
different
from
the
puzzles
before
attempting
to
change
an
earlier
transaction
maybe
to
fake
bitcoins
being
sent
or
change
the
number
of
someone's
bitcoins
requires
solving
that
puzzle
again
which
takes
a
lot
of
work
and
also
requires
solving
each
of
the
following
puzzles
which
takes
even
more
work
this
means
a
bitcoin
cheater
needs
to
outpace
all
the
other
bitcoin
miners
to
change
the
bitcoin
history
this
makes
the
bitcoin
blockchain
very
safe
to
use
a
popular
image
associated
with
bitcoin
is
a
qr
code
qr
codes
are
a
group
of
black
and
white
boxes
that
are
similar
to
barcodes
barcodes
are
a
row
of
lines
and
qr
codes
are
a
grid
of
squares
bitcoin
uses
qr
codes
because
they
can
store
more
information
in
a
small
space
and
a
camera
such
as
a
smartphone
can
read
them
the
two
qr
codes
on
the
bitcoin
note
are
the
public
and
private
addresses
and
can
be
scanned
with
a
number
of
online
tools
everyone
in
the
bitcoin
network
is
considered
a
peer
and
all
addresses
are
created
equal
all
transactions
can
take
place
solely
from
peer
to
peer
but
a
number
of
sites
exist
to
make
these
transactions
simpler
these
sites
are
called
exchanges
exchanges
provide
tools
for
dealing
in
bitcoin
some
allow
the
purchase
of
bitcoin
from
external
accounts
and
others
allow
trading
with
other
cryptography-based
currencies
like
bitcoin
most
exchanges
also
provide
a
basic
wallet
service
wallets
provide
a
handy
way
to
keep
track
of
all
of
a
user's
public
and
private
addresses
because
addresses
are
pseudo-anonymous
anyone
can
have
as
many
addresses
as
they
want
this
is
useful
for
dealing
with
multiple
people
but
it
can
get
complicated
to
manage
multiple
accounts
a
wallet
holds
all
of
this
information
in
a
convenient
place
just
like
a
real
wallet
would
a
backup
of
a
wallet
prevents
'losing'
the
bitcoins
bitcoin
adoption
and
use
continues
to
grow
a
lot
every
year
since
bitcoin
has
gained
the
attention
of
the
mainstream
media
one
way
is
the
wannacry
ransomware
created
in
may
adoption
growth
has
not
only
happened
for
consumers
but
also
for
many
companies
who
are
looking
to
make
use
of
all
of
the
advantages
of
bitcoin
among
millennials
cryptocurrencies
were
a
popular
choice
to
invest
in
in
a
recent
survey
of
americans
specifically
the
survey
found
that
of
millennials
-
would
invest
the
in
cryptocurrencies
compared
to
of
generation
xers
-
and
of
baby
boomers
what’s
more
interesting
is
that
bitcoin
remains
by
far
the
most
popular
choice
followed
by
ethereum
and
litecoin
specifically
of
the
millennials
in
the
survey
said
that
they
would
invest
the
in
bitcoin
in
ethereum
and
in
litecoin
although
the
real
time
price
and
trading
in
bitcoin
varies
with
market
demand
bitcoin
has
often
been
criticized
for
its
unstable
price
its
network's
high
electricity
consumption
and
for
its
high
transaction
fees
additionally
it
has
been
criticized
for
having
characteristics
in
common
with
ponzi
and
pyramid
schemes

tragedies
like
this

of
the
politics

that
he

the
start
of
his
second
term
in
had
a
few
setbacks
with
the
nsa
people
were
upset
at
the
obama
administration
that
the
government
was
possibly
listening
to
their
phone
calls
his
party
the
democrats
also
lost
the
congressional
elections
because
of
disagreements
between
democrats
and
republicans
in
congress
neither
side
is
getting
anything
done

has
resulted

using
his

reform
things
like
the
immigration
system

for

youtube
needed
the
adobe
flash
player
plug-in
to
play
videos
in
the
past
however
in
january
youtube
tried
using
the
built-in
features
of
web
browsers
so
people
would
not
need
to
use
adobe
flash

a

to

however
everyone
could
upload

when

started
but
in
march
a
ten-minute

put
in
the

was

in

most

can
be

and
videos
can
also
be
uploaded
from

youtube
is
blocked
in
many
schools
because
it
allows
children
to
search
for
videos
online
that
could
distract
them
from
their
lessons
much
like
how
other
social
networking
sites
and
game
sites
are
blocked
for
the
same
purpose
but
at
a
higher
level
than
schools
and
in
workplaces
even
some
governments
have
blocked
youtube
access
to
their
country's
public
but
their
reasons
can
vary
on
december
the
government
of
iran
blocked
youtube
and
several
other
sites
to
stop
films
and
music
from
other
countries
from
being
seen
turkey
blocked
youtube
on
march
for
letting
videos
that
were
mean
or
discriminating
to
turks
and
atatürk
who
is
the
founder
of
modern
turkey
to
be
shown
because
of
a
virtual
war
between
greeks
armenians
kurds
and
turks
on
youtube
with
people
from
each
side
posting
videos
to
hurt
the
other
the
video
that
caused
the
banning
said
that
turks
and
atatürk
were
'gay'
the
video
was
first
mentioned
on
turkish
cnn
and
the
istanbul
public
prosecutor
sued
youtube
for
being
mean
to
turkishness
the
court
suspended
access
to
youtube
while
waiting
for
the
removal
of
the
video
the
ban
was
criticized
a
lot
youtube
lawyers
sent
proof
of
removal
to
court
and
users
could
access
the
website
again
on
march
during
the
week
of
march
youtube
was
blocked
in
thailand
many
bloggers
people
who
have
a
diary
online
believed
the
reason
youtube
was
blocked
was
because
of
a
video
of
the
former
prime
minister
thaksin
shinawatra's
speech
on
cnn
however
the
government
did
not
confirm
or
give
reasons
for
the
ban
youtube
was
unblocked
on
march
on
the
night
of
april
youtube
was
again
blocked
in
thailand
the
government
said
it
was
because
of
a
video
on
the
site
that
it
said
was
insulting
to
king
bhumibol
adulyadej
the
ministry
of
information
and
communication
technology
claimed
that
it
would
unblock
youtube
in
a
few
days
after
websites
with
references
to
this
video
are
blocked
instead
of
the
entire
website
communications
minister
sitthichai
pookaiyaudom
said
when
they
decide
to
withdraw
the
clip
we
will
withdraw
the
ban
soon
after
this
incident
the
internet
technology
blog
mashable
was
banned
from
thailand
over
the
reporting
of
the
youtube
clips
in
question
youtube
is
being
sued
by
brazilian
model
and
mtv
vj
daniela
cicarelli
better
known
as
ronaldo's
ex-fiancée
because
she
says
that
the
site
is
making
available
a
video
footage
made
by
a
paparazzi
or
celebrity
photographer
in
which
she
and
her
boyfriend
are
having
sex
on
a
spanish
beach
the
lawsuit
says
that
youtube
has
to
be
blocked
in
brazil
until
all
copies
of
the
video
are
removed
on
saturday
january
a
legal
injunction
command
ordered
that
filters
be
put
in
place
to
prevent
users
in
brazil
from
going
to
the
website
the
effectiveness
of
the
measure
has
been
questioned
since
the
video
is
not
available
only
on
youtube
but
rather
has
become
an
internet
phenomenon
on
tuesday
january
the
same
court
overturned
their
earlier
decision
ordering
the
filters
to
be
taken
down
even
though
the
footage
was
still
forbidden
but
without
technical
support
for
its
blockage
on
may
the
state-owned
company
maroc
telecom
blocked
all
access
to
youtube
there
were
no
reasons
given
why
youtube
was
blocked
but
the
guesses
are
that
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
some
pro-separatist
group
polisario
clips
polisario
is
the
western
sahara
independence
movement
or
because
of
some
videos
that
criticized
king
mohammed
vi
this

not

the
other
two
private

aristotle's
father
nicomachus
was
a
solider
of
king
amyntas
of
macedonia
from
his
eighteenth
to
his
thirty-seventh
year
aristotle
lived
in
athens
as
a
metic
and
student
of
plato
at
about
the
age
of
eighteen
he
went
to
athens
to
continue
his
education
at
plato's
academy
aristotle
remained
at
the
academy
for
nearly
twenty
years
not
leaving
until
after
plato's
death
in
bc
he
then
traveled
with
xenocrates
to
asia
minor
while
in
asia
aristotle
traveled
with
theophrastus
to
the
island
of
lesbos
where
they
researched
the
botany
and
zoology
of
the
island
soon
after
hermias'
death
aristotle
was
invited
by
philip
ii
of
macedon
to
become
the
tutor
to
his
son
alexander
the
great
in
b
c
aristotle
was
appointed
as
the
head
of
the
royal
academy
of
macedon
during
that
time
he
gave
lessons
not
only
to
alexander
but
also
to
two
other
future
kings:
ptolemy
and
cassander
aristotle
encouraged
alexander
toward
eastern
conquest
and
his
attitude
towards
persia
was
ethnocentric
in
one
famous
example
he
advises
alexander
to
be
'a
leader
to
the
greeks
and
a
despot
to
the
barbarians
to
look
after
the
former
as
after
friends
and
relatives
and
to
deal
with
the
latter
as
with
beasts
or
plants'
pby
bc
he
had
returned
to
athens
starting
his
own
school
there
known
as
the
lyceum
aristotle
taught
courses
at
the
school
for
the
next
twelve
years
it
is
during
this
period
in
athens
from
to
when
aristotle
is
believed
to
have
written
many
of
his
works
aristotle
wrote
many
dialogues
only
fragments
of
which
survived
the
works
that
have
survived
are
in
fairly
rough
form
they
are
generally
thought
to
be
lecture
notes
for
his
students
aristotle's
combined
works
constitute
a
virtual
encyclopedia
of
greek
knowledge
it
has
been
suggested
that
aristotle
was
probably
the
last
person
to
know
everything
there
was
to
be
known
in
his
own
time
near
the
end
of
alexander's
life
he
began
to
suspect
plots
and
threatened
aristotle
in
letters
aristotle
was
vocal
about
his
dislike
for
alexander's
claim
of
divinity
and
the
king
executed
aristotle's
grandnephew
callisthenes
as
a
traitor
alexander
died
in
babylon
in
without
ever
having
returned
to
his
native
land
upon
alexander's
death
anti-macedonian
sentiment
in
athens
once
again
flared
up
and
aristotle
fled
the
city
however
he
died
in
euboea
of
natural
causes
that
same
year
bc
the
three
greatest
ancient
greek
philosophers
were
aristotle
plato
and
socrates
socrates
taught
plato
then
plato
taught
aristotle
these
three
thinkers
turned
early
greek
philosophy
into
the
beginnings
of
western
philosophy
as
it
is
today
aristotle
taught
alexander
the
great
who
later
conquered
the
entire
middle
east
plato's
main
ideas
were
that
knowledge
from
the
senses
was
always
confused
and
not
pure
true
knowledge
can
be
gotten
from
the
thinking
soul
that
turns
away
from
the
world
only
the
soul
can
have
knowledge
of
forms
the
real
way
things
are
the
world
is
only
a
copy
of
these
forms
and
is
not
perfect
aristotle
thought
differently
he
thought
that
knowledge
from
the
senses
was
more
important
these
thoughts
became
some
of
the
roots
of
the
scientific
method
after
hundreds
of
years
most
of
the
things
aristotle
wrote
that
we
still
have
today
are
notes
from
his
speaking
and
teaching
some
of
his
important
writings
are
physics
metaphysics
nicomachean
ethics
politics
de
anima
on
the
soul
and
poetics
he
also
had
problems
with
the
atomic
theory
he
did
not
believe
in
democritus'
theories
about
the
atomic
theory
he
believed
that
all
matter
was
continuous
whereas
democritus
stated
the
all
matter
was
made
up
of
tiny
indivisible
things
called
atoms
democritus
was
proved
right
by
physicist
john
dalton
in
aristotle
created
a
form
of
logic
his
logic
is
called
sentential
logic
because
it
uses
sentences
for
the
syllogism
aristotle's
logic
influenced
the
history
of
western
thought
it
was
aristotle's
logic
which
was
copied
and
used
in
the
arabic
and
latin
mediaeval
traditions
it
was
dominant
for
two
and
a
half
thousand
years
until
the
late
th
century
then
modern
logic
was
started
by
gottlob
frege
charles
sanders
peirce
and
others
aristotle
is
the
earliest
natural
historian
whose
work
has
survived
in
some
detail
he
certainly
did
research
on
the
natural
history
of
lesbos
and
the
surrounding
seas
and
neighbouring
areas
the
works
history
of
animals
generation
of
animals
and
parts
of
animals
have
observations
and
interpretations
along
with
some
myths
and
mistakes
the
most
striking
passages
are
about
the
sea-life
round
lesbos
as
well
as
live
observation
he
got
specimens
from
the
catches
of
fishermen
his
observations
on
catfish
electric
fish
torpedo
and
angler-fish
are
detailed
his
writing
on
cephalopods
such
as
octopus
sepia
cuttlefish
and
the
paper
nautilus
argonauta
argo
are
accurate
his
description
of
the
hectocotyl
arm
used
in
sexual
reproduction
was
widely
disbelieved
until
its
rediscovery
in
the
th
century
he
separated
the
aquatic
mammals
from
fish
and
knew
that
sharks
and
rays
were
part
of
the
group
he
called
selachē
selachimorpha
another
good
example
of
his
methods
comes
from
the
generation
of
animals
in
which
aristotle
describes
breaking
open
fertilized
chicken
eggs
at
intervals
to
observe
when
visible
organs
were
generated
he
gave
accurate
descriptions
of
ruminants'
four-chambered
fore-stomachs
and
of
the
ovoviviparous
embryological
development
of
the
hound
shark
mustelus

aristotle
is
still
one
of
the
most
influential
people
who
ever
lived
he
contributed
to
almost
every
kind
of
knowledge
in
his
day
and
he
started
many
new
fields
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
human
being
has
ever
known
as
much
as
he
did
aristotle
was
the
founder
of
formal
logicp
pioneered
the
study
of
zoology
and
helped
to
develop
scientific
method
pdespite
these
achievements
aristotle's
errors
are
thought
by
some
such
as
peter
medawar
to
have
held
back
science
considerably
bertrand
russell
notes
that
almost
every
serious
intellectual
advance
has
had
to
begin
with
an
attack
on
some
aristotelian
doctrine
russell
also
refers
to
aristotle's
ethics
as
repulsive
and
calls
his
logic
as
definitely
antiquated
as
ptolemaic
astronomy
russell
says
these
errors
make
it
difficult
to
do
historical
justice
to
aristotle
until
one
remembers
what
an
advance
he
made
on
his
predecessors
the
immediate
influence
of
aristotle's
work
was
felt
as
the
lyceum
grew
into
the
peripatetic
school
of
philosophers
aristotle's
influence
over
alexander
the
great
is
seen
in
the
latter's
bringing
with
him
on
his

the
first
known
statistics
are
census
data
the
babylonians
did
a
census
around
bc
the
egyptians
around
bc
and
the
ancient
chinese
around
bc
before
we
can
describe
the
world
with
statistics
we
must
collect
data
the
data
that
we
collect
in
statistics
are
called
measurements
after
we
collect
data
we
use
one
or
more
numbers
to
describe
each
observation
or
measurement
for
example
suppose
we
want
to
find
out
how
popular
a
certain
tv
show
is
we
can
pick
a
group
of
people
called
a
sample
out
of
the
total
population
of
viewers
then
we
ask
each
viewer
in
the
sample
how
often
they
watch
the
show
the
sample
is
data
that
you
can
see
and
the
population
is
data
that
you
cannot
see
since
you
did
not
ask
every
viewer
in
the
population
for
another
example
if
we
want
to
know
whether
a
certain
drug
can
help
lower
blood
pressure
we
could
give
the
drug
to
people
for
some
time
and
measure
their
blood
pressure
before
and
after
numbers
that
describe
data
that
you
can
see
are
called
descriptive
statistics
numbers
that
make
predictions
about
data
that
you
can't
see
are
called
inferential
statistics
descriptive
statistics
involves
using
numbers
to
describe
features
of
data
for
example
the
average
height
of
women
in
the
united
states
is
a
descriptive
statistic
that
describes
a
feature
average
height
of
a
population
women
in
the
united
states
once
the
results
have
been
summarized
and
described
they
can
be
used
for
prediction
this
is
called
inferential
statistics
as
an
example
the
size
of
an
animal
is
dependent
on
many
factors
some
of
these
factors
are
controlled
by
the
environment
but
others
are
by
inheritance
a
biologist
might
therefore
make
a
model
that
says
that
there
is
a
high
probability
that
the
offspring
will
be
small
in
size
if
the
parents
were
small
in
size
this
model
probably
allows
to
predict
the
size
in
better
ways
than
by
just
guessing
at
random
testing
whether
a
certain
drug
can
be
used
to
cure
a
certain
condition
or
disease
is
usually
done
by
comparing
the
results
of
people
who
are
given
the
drug
against
those
of
people
who
are
given
a
placebo
most
often
we
collect
statistical
data
by
doing
surveys
or
experiments
for
example
an
opinion
poll
is
one
kind
of
survey
we
pick
a
small
number
of
people
and
ask
them
questions
then
we
use
their
answers
as
the
data
the
choice
of
which
individuals
to
take
for
a
survey
or
data
collection
is
important
as
it
directly
influences
the
statistics
when
the
statistics
are
done
it
can
no
longer
be
determined
which
individuals
are
taken
suppose
we
want
to
measure
the
water
quality
of
a
big
lake
if
we
take
samples
next
to
the
waste
drain
we
will
get
different
results
than
if
the
samples
are
taken
in
a
far
away
hard
to
reach
spot
of
the
lake
there
are
two
kinds
of
problems
which
are
commonly
found
when
taking
samples:
if
there
are
many
samples
the
samples
will
likely
be
very
close
to
what
they
are
in
the
real
population
if
there
are
very
few
samples
however
they
might
be
very
different
from
what
they
are
in
the
real
population
this
error
is
called
a
chance
error
see
errors
and
residuals
in
statistics
the
individuals
for
the
samples
need
to
be
chosen
carefully
usually
they
will
be
chosen
randomly
if
this
is
not
the
case
the
samples
might
be
very
different
from
what
they
really
are
in
the
total
population
this
is
true
even
if
a
great
number
of
samples
is
taken
this
kind
of
error
is
called
bias
we
can
reduce
chance
errors
by
taking
a
larger
sample
and
we
can
avoid
some
bias
by
choosing
randomly
however
sometimes
large
random
samples
are
hard
to
take
and
bias
can
happen
if
different
people
are
not
asked
or
refuse
to
answer
our
questions
or
if
they
know
they
are
getting
a
fake
treatment
these
problems
can
be
hard
to
fix
see
also
standard
error
the
middle
of
the
data
is
called
an
average
the
average
tells
us
about
a
typical
individual
in
the
population
there
are
three
kinds
of
average
that
are
often
used:
the
mean
the
median
and
the
mode
the
examples
below
use
this
sample
data:
name
a
b
c
d
e
f
g
h
i
j
---------------------------------------------
score
the
formula
for
the
mean
is
x
¯
=
n
∑
i
=
n
x
i
=
x
x
⋯
x
n
n
\displaystyle
\bar
x=\frac
n\sum
_i=nx_i=\frac
x_x_\cdots
x_nn
where
x
x
…
x
n
\displaystyle
x_x_\ldots
x_n
are
the
data
and
n
\displaystyle
n
is
the
population
size
see
sigma
notation
this
means
that
you
add
up
all
the
values
and
then
divide
by
the
number
of
values
in
our
example
x
¯
=
/
=
\displaystyle
\bar
x=/=
the
problem
with
the
mean
is
that
it
does
not
tell
anything
about
how
the
values
are
distributed
values
that
are
very
large
or
very
small
change
the
mean
a
lot
in
statistics
these
extreme
values
might
be
errors
of
measurement
but
sometimes
the
population
really
does
contain
these
values
for
example
if
in
a
room
there
are
people
who
make
/day
and
who
makes
/day
the
mean
of
the
data
is
/day
even
though
it
is
the
average
amount
the
mean
in
this
case
is
not
the
amount
any
single
person
makes
thus
is
useless
for
some
purposes
this
is
the
arithmetic
mean
other
kinds
are
useful
for
some
purposes
the
median
is
the
middle
item
of
the
data
to
find
the
median
we
sort
the
data
from
the
smallest
number
to
the
largest
number
and
then
choose
the
number
in
the
middle
if
there
is
an
even
number
of
data
there
will
not
be
a
number
right
in
the
middle
so
we
choose
the
two
middle
ones
and
calculate
their
mean
in
our
example
there
are
items
of
data
the
two
middle
ones
are
and
so
the
median
is
/
=
another
example
like
the
income
example
presented
for
the
mean
consider
a
room
with
people
who
have
incomes
of
and
the
median
is
because
is
the
average
of
the
two
middle
numbers
and
if
the
extreme
value
of
is
ignored
the
mean
is
in
this
case
the
median
is
close
to
the
value
obtained
when
the
extreme
value
is
thrown
out
the
median
solves
the
problem
of
extreme
values
as
described
in
the
definition
of
mean
above
the
mode
is
the
most
frequent
item
of
data
for
example
the
most
common
letter
in
english
is
the
letter
e
we
would
say
that
e
is
the
mode
of
the
distribution
of
the
letters
for
example
if
in
a
room
there
are
people
with
incomes
of
and
the
mode
is
because
occurs
three
times
and
all
other
values
occur
fewer
than
three
times
there
can
be
more
than
one
mode
for
example
if
in
a
room
there
are
people
with
incomes
of
and
the
modes
are
and
this
is
bi-modal
or
has
two
modes
bi-modality
is
very
common
and
often
indicates
that
the
data
is
the
combination
of
two
different
groups
for
instance
the
average
height
of
all
adults
in
the
has
a
bi-modal
distribution
this
is
because
males
and
females
have
separate
average
heights
of
m
ft
⁄
in
for
men
and
m
ft
in
for
women
these
peaks
are
apparent
when
both
groups
are
combined
the
mode
is
the
only
form
of
average
that
can
be
used
for
data
that
can
not
be
put
in
order
another
thing
we
can
say
about
a
set
of
data
is
how
spread
out
it
is
a
common
way
to
describe
the
spread
of
a
set
of
data
is
the
standard
deviation
if
the
standard
deviation
of
a
set
of
data
is
small
then
most
of
the
data
is
very
close
to
the
average
if
the
standard
deviation
is
large
though
then
a
lot
of
the
data
is
very
different
from
the
average
if
the
data
follows
the
common
pattern
called
the
normal
distribution
then
it
is
very
useful
to
know
the
standard
deviation
if
the
data
follows
this
pattern
we
would
say
the
data
is
normally
distributed
about
of
every
pieces
of
data
will
be
off
the
average
by
less
than
the
standard
deviation
not
only
that
but
about
of
every
measurements
will
be
off
the
average
by
less
that
two
times
the
standard
deviation
and
about
in
will
be
closer
to
the
average
than
three
standard
deviations
we
also
can
use
statistics
to
find
out
that
some
percent
percentile
number
or
fraction
of
people
or
things
in
a
group
do
something
or
fit
in
a
certain
category
for
example
social
scientists
used
statistics
to
find
out
that
of
people
in
the
world
are
males
==
references
==
before
people
studied
substances
to
figure
out
how
to
do
things
such
as
turn
lead
into
gold
but
no
one
managed
to
do
that
this
was
called
alchemy
alchemists
separated
the
air
into
many
parts
and
isolated
the
noble
gases
from
it
they
also
processed
special
minerals
from
a
mine
in
sweden
to
get
rare
earth
metals
radioactivity
was
also
discovered
today
chemists
have
discovered
different
elements
some
are
very
common
like
oxygen
many
are
very
rare
and
expensive
like
platinum
some
cannot
be
found
on
earth
and
can
only
be
made
in
labs
like
rutherfordium
since
the
the
increased
understanding
of
physics
has
changed
chemists'
theories
about
chemical
reactions
with
smaller
and
faster
computers
chemists
have
built
better
tools
for
analyzing
substances
these
tools
have
been
sent
to
study
chemicals
on
mars
police
also
use
those
tools
to
study
evidence
from
crime
scenes
there
are
several
types
of
chemistry
analytical
chemistry
looks
at
which
chemicals
are
in
things
for
example
looking
at
how
much
arsenic
is
in
food
organic
chemistry
looks
at
things
that
have
carbon
in
them
for
example
making
acetylene
inorganic
chemistry
looks
at
things
that
do
not
have
carbon
in
them
one
example
is
making
an
integrated
circuit
a
large
area
of
chemistry
is
polymer
chemistry
this
looks
at
plastics
one
example
is
making
nylon
because
plastics
are
made
of
carbon
polymer
chemistry
is
part
of
organic
chemistry
another
area
is
biochemistry
this
looks
at
the
chemistry
of
living
things
an
example
would
be
seeing
how
arsenic
poisons
people
biochemistry
is
also
part
of
organic
chemistry
there
are
many
other
small
branches
of
chemistry
the
basic
unit
of
an
element
is
called
an
atom
an
atom
is
the
smallest
building
block
that
you
can
cut
an
element
into
without
the
element
breaking
down
turning
into
a
lighter
element
for
example
through
nuclear
fission
or
radioactive
decay
a
chemical
compound
is
a
substance
made
up
of
two
or
more
elements
in
a
compound
two
or
more
atoms
are
joined
together
to
form
a
molecule
the
tiniest
speck
of
dust
or
drop
of
liquid
that
one
can
see
is
made
up
of
many
millions
or
billions
of
these
molecules
mixtures
are
substances
where
chemicals
are
mixed
but
not
reacted
an
example
would
be
mixing
sand
and
salt
this
can
be
undone
again
to
produce
salt
and
sand
separately
chemical
compounds
are
changed
by
a
chemical
reaction
an
example
would
be
heating
sodium
bicarbonate
common
baking
soda
it
will
make
water
carbon
dioxide
and
sodium
carbonate
this
reaction
cannot
be
undone
one
very
important
concept
in
chemistry
is
that
different
atoms
interact
with
one
another
in
very
specific
proportions
for
example
two
hydrogen
atoms
interacting
with
one
oxygen
atom
lead
to
the
water
molecule
ho
this
relationship
is
known
as
the
law
of
constant
proportions
and
leads
to
the
idea
of
stoichiometry
a
term
that
refers
to
the
ratios
of
different
atoms
in
chemical
compounds
for
example
in
water
there
are
always
exactly
hydrogen
atoms
to
oxygen
atom
in
carbon
dioxide
there
are
exactly
oxygen
atoms
for
carbon
atom
these
relationships
are
described
using
chemical
formulas
such
as
ho
two
hydrogen
atoms
and
one
oxygen
atom
and
co
one
carbon
atom
and
two
oxygen
atoms
because
atoms
of
different
elements
react
with
one
another
in
very
specific
proportions
but
atoms
of
different
elements
have
different
weights
chemists
often
describe
the
amount
of
different
elements
and
compounds
in
terms
of
the
number
of
moles
a
mole
of
any
element
contains
the
same
number
of
atoms:
atoms
the
atomic
mass
of
an
element
can
be
used
to
see
how
much
of
the
element
makes
a
mole
for
example
the
atomic
mass
of
copper
is
about
that
means
about
grams
of
copper
metal
has
a
mole
of
atoms
the
atomic
mass
of
chlorine
is
about
that
means
grams
of
chlorine
has
a
mole
of
atoms
in
it
moles
can
be
used
to
see
how
many
molecules
are
in
chemical
compounds
too
copperii
chloride
is
an
example
cucl
is
its
chemical
formula
there
is
one
copper
atom
and
two
chlorine
atoms
·
=
add
all
the
molar
masses
of
the
elements
together
to
get
the
molar
mass
of
the
chemical
compound
=
that
means
in
grams
of
copperii
chloride
there
is
one
mole
of
copperii
chloride
molecules
this
concept
is
used
to
calculate
how
much
chemicals
are
needed
in
a
chemical
reaction
if
no
reactants
chemicals
that
are
reacted
should
be
left
if
too
much
reactant
is
used
there
will
be
some
reactants
left
in
the
chemical
reaction
acids
and
bases
are
common
chemicals
acids
release
h
ions
when
in
water
and
bases
release
oh−
ions
when
in
water
acids
can
react
with
bases
the
h
ion
is
taken
from
the
acid
by
the
base
this
makes
water
ho
a
salt
is
also
made
when
an
acid
and
a
base
react
together
an
example
would
be
reacting
hydrochloric
acid
hcl
and
sodium
hydroxide
naoh
hydrochloric
acid
releases
h
and
cl-
ions
in
water
the
base
releases
na
and
oh-
ions
the
h
and
the
oh-
react
to
make
water
there
is
a
solution
of
sodium
chloride
nacl
left
sodium
chloride
is
a
salt
chemistry
is
very
useful
in
everyday
life
and
makes
up
the
foundation
of
many
branches
of
science
most
objects
are
made
by
chemists
people
who
do
chemistry
chemists
are
constantly
working
to
find
new
and
useful
substances
chemists
make
new
drugs
and
materials
like
paints
that
we
use
every
day
many
chemicals
are
harmless
but
there
are
some
chemicals
that
are
dangerous
for
example
mercuryii
chloride
is
very
toxic
chromates
can
cause
cancer
tinii
chloride
pollutes
water
easily
hydrochloric
acid
can
cause
bad
burns
some
chemicals
like
hydrogen
can
explode
or
catch
fire
to
stay
safe
chemists
experiment
with
chemicals
in
a
chemical
lab
they
use
special
equipment
and
clothing
to
do
reactions
and
keep
the
chemicals
contained
the
chemicals
used
in
drugs
and
in
things
like
bleach
have
been
tested
to
make
sure
they
are
safe

used

most
historians
agree
that
the
game
of
chess
was
first
played
in
northern
india
during
the
gupta
empire
in
the
th
century
ad
this
early
type
of
chess
was
known
as
chaturanga
a
sanskrit
word
for
the
military
the
gupta
chess
pieces
were
divided
like
their
military
into
the
infantry
cavalry
elephants
and
chariots
in
time
these
pieces
became
the
pawn
knight
bishop
and
rook
the
english
words
chess
and
check
both
come
from
the
persian
word
shāh
meaning
king
the
earliest
written
evidence
of
chess
is
found
in
three
romances
epic
stories
written
in
sassanid
persia
around
ad
the
game
was
known
as
chatrang
or
shatranj
when
persia
was
taken
over
by
muslims
–
the
game
was
spread
to
all
parts
of
the
muslim
world
muslim
traders
carried
the
game
to
russia
and
to
western
europe
by
the
year
it
had
spread
all
over
europe
in
the
th
century
a
spanish
manuscript
called
libro
de
los
juegos
describes
the
games
of
shatranj
chess
backgammon
and
dice
the
game
changed
greatly
between
about
to
the
rules
of
the
older
game
were
changed
in
the
west
so
that
some
of
the
pieces
queen
bishop
had
more
scope
development
of
the
pieces
was
faster
and
the
game
more
exciting
the
new
game
formed
the
basis
of
modern
international
chess
historians
of
chess
consider
this
as
the
most
important
change
since
the
game
was
invented
the
rules
of
chess
are
governed
by
the
world
chess
federation
which
is
known
by
the
initials
fide
meaning
fédération
internationale
des

the
rules
are
in
the
section
laws
of

of
the

handbook
fide
also
give
rules
and
guidelines
for
chess
tournaments
chess
is
played
on
a
square
board
divided
into
eight
rows
of
squares
called
ranks
and
eight
columns
called
files
with
a
dark
square
in
each
player's
lower
left
corner
this
is
altogether
squares
the
colors
of
the
squares
are
laid
out
in
a
checker
chequer
pattern
in
light
and
dark
squares
to
make
speaking
and
writing
about
chess
easy
each
square
has
a
name
each
rank
has
a
number
from
to
and
each
file
a
letter
from
a
to
h
this
means
that
every
square
on
the
board
has
its
own
label
such
as
g
or
f
the
pieces
are
in
white
and
black
sets
the
players
are
called
white
and
black
and
at
the
start
of
a
game
each
player
has
pieces
the
pieces
are
one
king
one
queen
two
rooks
two
bishops
two
knights
and
eight
pawns
in
this
game
out
can
get
up
to
a
quadruple
pon
king
knight
queen
and
also
the
king
although
it
is
very
rare
definitions:
vertical
lines
are
files
horizontal
lines
are
ranks
lines
at

are
diagonals
each
piece
has
its
own
way
of
moving
around
the
board
the
x
marks
the
squares
where
the
piece
can
move
the
knight
is
the
only
piece
that
can
jump
over
another
piece
no
piece
may
move
to
a
square
occupied
by
a
piece
of
the
same
color
all
pieces
capture
the
same
way
they
move
except
pawns
the
king's
move
is
one
square
in
any
direction
the
king
k
for
short
may
not
move
to
any
square
where
it
is
threatened
by
an
opposing
piece
however
the
king
can
move
to
a
square
that
is
occupied
by
an
opponent's
piece
and
capture
the
piece
taking
it
off
the
board
the
queen
q
can
move
any
distance
in
any
direction
on
the
ranks
files
and
diagonals
the
rooks
r
move
any
distance
on
the
ranks
or
files
the
bishops
b
move
diagonally
on
the
board
since
a
bishop
can
only
move
diagonally
it
will
always
be
on
the
same
color
square
the
knights
kt
or
n
move
in
an
l
shape
each
move
must
be
either
two
squares
along
a
rank
and
one
square
along
a
file
or
two
squares
along
a
file
and
one
square
along
a
rank
it
is
the
only
piece
that
can
jump
over
other
pieces
like
the
other
pieces
it
captures
an
opposing
piece
by
landing
on
its
square
the
pawns
can
only
move
up
the
board
on
its
first
move
a
pawn
may
move
either
one
or
two
squares
forward
a
pawn
captures
one
square
diagonally
not
as
it
moves:
see
white
circles
on
its
diagram
besides
in
some
situations
pawns
can
capture
opponent's
pawns
in
a
special
way
called
en
passant
which
means
in
passing
in
french
see
below
most
pieces
capture
as
they
move
if
a
piece
lands
on
an
opponent's
piece
the
opposing
piece
is
taken
off
the
board
there
are
three
special
cases:
the
king
cannot
be
taken
see
check
and
checkmate
no
piece
can
be
taken
while
castling
see
below
pawns
take
one
square
diagonally
if
a
move
is
made
which
attacks
the
opposing
king
that
king
is
said
to
be
'in
check'
the
player
whose
king
is
checked
must
make
a
move
to
remove
the
check
the
options
are:
moving
the
king
capturing
the
threatening
piece
or
moving
another
piece
between
the
threatening
piece
and
the
king
if
the
player
whose
king
is
in
danger
cannot
do
any
of
these
things
it
is
checkmate
and
the
player
loses
the
game
once
in
every
game
each
king
can
make
a
special
move
known
as
castling
when
the
king
castles
it
moves
two
squares
to
the
left
or
right
when
this
happens
the
rook
is
moved
to
stand
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
king
castling
is
only
allowed
if
all
of
these
rules
are
kept:p
neither
piece
doing
the
castling
may
have
been
moved
during
the
game
there
must
be
no
pieces
between
the
king
and
the
rook
the
king
may
not
be
currently
in
check
nor
may
the
king
pass
through
any
square
attacked
by
the
opponent
as
with
any
move
castling
is
not
allowed
if
it
would
place
the
king
in
check
en
passant
'in
passing'
in
french
is
a
special
capture
it
is
only
available
when
a
pawn
moves
forward
two
squares
past
an
opposing
pawn
on
an
adjacent
file
the
opposing
pawn
must
be
on
the
th
rank
from
its
own
side
then
the
opponent's
pawn
can
capture
the
double-mover
as
if
it
had
only
moved
one
square
forward
this
option
is
open
on
the
next
move
only
for
example
if
the
black
pawn
has
just
moved
up
two
squares
from
g
to
g
then
the
white
pawn
on
f
can
take
it
by
en
passant
on
g
the
en
passant
rule
was
developed
when
pawns
were
allowed
to
make
their
double
move
the
rule
made
it
more
difficult
for
players
to
avoid
pawn
exchanges
and
blockade
the
position
it
kept
the
game
more
open
when
a
pawn
moves
to
its
eighth
rank
it
must
be
changed
for
a
piece:
a
queen
rook
bishop
or
knight
of
the
same
color
player's
choice
normally
the
pawn
is
queened
but
in
some
advantageous
cases
another
piece
is
chosen
called
'under-promotion'
checkmates
are
rare
in
competitive
chess
the
most
common
ends
are
decisions
made
by
one
or
both
players
checkmate
when
a
king
is
in
check
and
cannot
get
out
of
it
resignation
a
player
may
resign
at
any
time
usually
because
his/her
position
is
hopeless
a
losing
player
is
able
to
resign
by
placing
their
king
on
its
side
on
the
chessboard

the
moves
of
a
chess
game
are
written
down
by
using
a
special
chess
notation
this
is
compulsory
for
any
competitive
game
article
appendix
e
usually
algebraic
chess
notation
is
used
in
algebraic

each
square
has
one
and
only
one
name
whether
you
are
looking
from
white's
side
of
the
board
or
black's
here
moves
are
written
in
the
format
of:
initial
of
piece
moved
–
file
where
it
moved
–
rank
where
it
moved
for
example
qg
means
queen
moves
to
the
g-file
and
th
rank
that
is
to
the
square
g
if
there
are
two
pieces
of
the
same
type
that
can
move
to
the
same
square
one
more
letter
or
number
is
added
to
show
the
file
or
rank
from
which
the
piece
moved
e
g
ngf
means
knight
from
the
g-file
moves
to
the
square
f
the
letter
p
showing
a
pawn
is
not
used
so
that
e
means
pawn
moves
to
the
square
e
if
the
piece
makes
a
capture
x
is
written
before
the
square
in
which
the
capturing
piece
lands
on
example:
bxf
means
bishop
captures
on
f
when
a
pawn
makes
a
capture
the
file
from
which
the
pawn
left
is
used
in
place
of
a
piece
initial
for
example:
exd
means
pawn
captures
on
d
if
a
pawn
moves
to
its
eighth
rank
getting
a
promotion
the
piece
chosen
is
written
after
the
move
for
example
eq
or
e=q
castling
is
written
by
the
special
notations
-
for
kingside
castling
and
--
for
queenside
a
move
which
places
the
opponent's
king
in
check
normally
has
the
notation
added
checkmate
can
be
written
as
or
at
the
end
of
the
game
-
means
white
won
-
means
black
won
and
½-½
is
a
draw
in
print
figurines
like
those
in
diagrams
but
smaller
are
used
for
the
pieces
rather
than
initials
this
has
the
advantage
of
being
language-free
whereas
the
initials
of
pieces
are
different
in
every
language
typefaces
which
include
figurines
can
be
purchased
by
chess
authors
also
basic
notes
can
be
added
by
using
a
system
of
well-known
punctuation
marks
and
other
symbols
for
example:
means
a
good
move
means
a
very
good
move
?
means
a
bad
move
??
a
very
bad
move
sometimes
called
a
blunder
?
a
creative
move
that
may
be
good
and
?
a
doubtful
move
the
purpose
of
these
methods
is
to
make
publications
readable
in
a
wider
range
of
countries
for
example
one
kind
of
a

with

all
comes
the
openings
about
which
a
great
deal
is
now
known
the
best-known

is
the

to
that
move
in

ways

first
moves
of
a
chess

are
called

a
chess
opening
is
a
name
given
to
a
series
of
opening
moves
recognized
patterns
of
opening
moves
are
openings
and
have
been
given
names
such
as
the
ruy
lopez
or
sicilian
defence
they
are
listed
in
reference
works
such
as
the
encyclopaedia
of
chess
openings
there
are
dozens
of
different
openings
they
range
from
gambits
where
a
pawn
say
is
offered
for
fast
development
e
g
the
king's
gambit
to
slower
openings
which
lead

the
sequence
thought
best
for

moves
but
most
players
avoid
such
lines
expert
players
study
openings
throughout
their
chess
career
as
opening
theory
keeps
on
developing
the
basic
aims
of
the
opening
phase
are:
development:
to
place
develop
the
pieces
mostly
bishops
and
knights
on
useful
squares
where
they
will
have
the
most
powerful
impact
on
the
game
control
of
the
center:
the
center
is
the
most
important
part
of
the
board
the
player
who
controls
the
center
can
move
his/her
pieces
around
freely
his/her
opponent
on
the
other
hand
will
find
his/her
pieces
cramped
and
difficult
to
move
about
king
safety:
keeping
the
king
safe
from
danger
castling
see
section
above
can
often
do
this
pawn
structure:
pawns
can
be
used
to
control
the
center
players
try
to
avoid
making
pawn
weaknesses
such
as
isolated
doubled
or
backward
pawns
and
pawn
islands
–
and
to
force
such
weaknesses
in
the
opponent's
position
players
think
and
chess
databases
prove
that
white
by
virtue
of
the
first
move
begins
the
game
with
a
better
chance
black
normally
tries
to
equalise
or
to
get
some
counterplay
the
middlegame
is
the
part
of
the
game
after
most
pieces
have
been
developed
it
is
where
most
games
are
won
and
lost
many
games
will
end
in
resignation
even
before
an
endgame
takes
place
a
middlegame
position
has
a
structure
that
structure
is
determined
by
the
opening
the
simplest
way
to
learn
the
middlegame
is
to
select
an
opening
and
learn
it
well
see
examples
in
english
opening
and
french
defence
these
are
some
things
to
look
for
when
looking
at
a
middlegame
position:
material:
changes
in
the
balance
of
material
are
critical
to
lose
a
piece
for
nothing
is
enough
to
lose
a
game
if
the
players
are
evenly
matched
then
a
rough
material
balance
of
pieces
is
normal
material
balance
is
often
quite
static:
it
does
not
change
for
many
moves
development:
the
opening
may
have
left
one
player
with
a
lead
in
development
that
player
has
the
initiative
and
may
attack
before
the
opponent
can
get
his
pieces
out
it
is
a
temporary
asset:
if
a
lead
in
development
is
not
used
effectively
it
will
disappear
the
centre:
in
the
centre
pieces
have
their
greatest
effect
and
some
such
as
the
knight
attack
more
squares
in
the
centre
than
at
the
sides
the
player
who
controls
the
centre
will
almost
always
have
the
advantage
mobility:
a
position
is
mobile
if
the
pieces
can
get
where
they
need
to
almost
all
middle
game
positions
have
some
limitations
to
mobility
look
for
open
files
for
the
rooks
and
open
diagonals
for
the
bishops
outposts
are
what
knights
need
places
where
they
can
not
easily
be
dislodged
king
safety:
where
is
the
king?
ideally
a
king
should
be
castled
and
kept
behind
a
screen
of
pawns
many
other
things
may
happen
in
practice
if
a
king
is
weak
it
may
be
put
under
direct
attack
pawns:
they
provide
the
skeleton
of
a
position
they
move
slowly
and
may
become
blocked
for
many
moves
everything
takes
place
round
the
pawns
different
openings
produce
different
pawn
structures
in
this
way
openings
influence
the
whole

philidor:
pawns
are
the
soul
of
chess

an
example
from

borderline
between

by

important
defensive

maybe

plough
ahead

the
key

chessbase
shows
that
the
number
of
tournament
games
with
these
choices
were:
re
g
c
the
data
base
also
shows
that
the
overall
results
were
significantly
better
for
re
what
the
player
does
is
note
the
features
on
the
board
and
formulate
a
plan
which
takes
the
features
into
account
then
the
player
works
out
a
sequence
of
moves
of
course
in
practice
the
opponent
is
interfering
with
the
plan
at
every
step
the
endgame
or
end
game
or
ending
is
the
part
of
the
game
when
there
are
few
pieces
left
on
the
board
there
are
three
main
strategic
differences
between
earlier
parts
of
the
game
and
endgame:
pawns:
during
the
endgame
pawns
become
more
special
in
the
endgame
one
thing
players
try
to
do
is
to
promote
a
pawn
by
advancing
it
to
the
eighth
rank
kings:
may
become
strong
pieces
in
the
endgame
the
king
may
be
brought
towards
the
center
of
the
board
there
it
can
support
its
own
pawns
attack
the
opponent's
pawns
and
oppose
the
opponent's
king
draws:
in
the
endgame
a
game
may
be
drawn
because
there
are
too
few
pieces
on
the
board
to
allow
a
player
to
win
this
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
for
games
to
be
drawn
all
endgame
positions
can
be
put
into
two
camps
on
the
one
hand
are
positions
which
may
be
won
by
force
on
the
other
hand
are
positions
which
are
drawn
or
which
should
be
drawn
the
ones
that
are
drawn
for
certain
may
be
legally
drawn
mate
could
not
happen
or
drawn
by
chess
experience
no
sane
defence
could
lose
all
endgames
in
master
chess
revolve
around
the
borderline
between
winning
and
drawing
generally
once
a
'textbook'
drawn
position
is
reached
the
players
will
agree
a
draw
otherwise
they
play
on
endgames
can
be
studied
according
to
the
types
of
pieces
that
remain
on
board
for
example
king
and
pawn
endgames
have
only
kings
and
pawns
on
one
or
both
sides
and
the
task
of
the
stronger
side
is
to
promote
one
of
the
pawns
other
endings
are
studied
according
to
the
pieces
on
board
other
than
kings
e
g
rook
and
pawn
versus
rook
endgame
basic
checkmates
are
positions
in
which
one
side
has
only
a
king
and
the
other
side
has
one
or
two
pieces
enough
to
checkmate
the
opponent's
king
they
are
usually
learned
at
the
beginner
stage
examples
are

this
one
is
quite
difficult
there
are
two
types
of
chess
programs
one
is
to
play
against
you
the
other
is
to
help
you
become
a
better
player
by
learning
more
the
two
types
can
be
made
to
work
together
though
they
have
different
functions
chess
engines
are
computer
systems
that
can
play
chess
games
against
human
opponents
quite
a
number
have
been
devised
they
can
play
at
master
level
though
their
processes
are
quite
different

chess
databases
do
not
actually
play
they
give
access
to
the
recorded
history
of
master
chess
there
are
two
components
first
there
is
the
software
which
lets
one
search
and
organise
the
database
material
then
there
is
the
actual
database
typically
one
to
four
million
games
in
practice
databases
are
used
for
two
purposes
first
for
a
player
to
train
his/her
ability
at
specific
openings
second
to
look
up
specific
opponents
to
see
what
they
play
and
prepare
against
them
beforehand
the
existence
of
chess
databases
is
one
of
the
reasons
young
players
can
achieve
mastery
at
an
early
age
chessbase
is
the
biggest
database
and
widely
used
by
masters
although
it
can
be
used
online
most
users
download
the
software
and
data
onto
their
computer
if
that
computer
happens
to
be
a
laptop
then
they
might
take
the
laptop
to
tournaments
to
help
prepare
for
games
players
may
not
use
computers
or
any
other
aid
during
games
but
much
preparation
goes
on
behind
the
scenes
chessbase
has
to
be
purchased
and
it
is
not
cheap
this
is
a
dutch
magazine
for
advanced
players
which
runs
an
on-line
database
called
nicbase
as
part
of
its
services
nicbase
is
free
and
has
over
a
million
games
chessgames
com
runs
an
on-line
database
of
games
it
is
partly
free
but
requires
registration
full
access
to
all
its
facilities
is
by
a
fairly
modest
subscription
it
has
over
half
a
million
games
on
its
database
there
are
websites
which
a
player
can
join
for
a
fee
and
play
on
line
in
this
case
the
subscriber
will
play
against
other
subscribers
not
a

all
standards
of

are

python
is
used
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
programmers
and
is
used
in
many
places
sometimes
only
python
code
is
used
for
a
program
but
most
of
the
time
it
is
used
to
do
simple
jobs
while
another
programming
language
is
used
to
do
more
complicated
tasks
its
standard
library
is
made
up
of
many
functions
that
come
with
python
when
it
is
installed
on
the
internet
there
are
many
other
libraries
available
that
make
it
possible
for
the
python
language
to
do
more
things
these
libraries
make
it
a
powerful
language
it
can
do
many
different
things
some
things
that
python
is
often
used
for
are:
web
development
game
programming
desktop
guis
scientific
programming
network
programming
this
is
a
small
example
of
a
python
program
it
shows
hello
world
on
the
screen
python
also
does
something
called
dynamic
variable
assignment
this
means
that
when
a
number
or
word
is
made
in
a
program
the
user
does
not
have
to
say
what
type
it
is
this
makes
it
easier
to
reuse
variable
names
making
fast
changes
simpler
an
example
of
this
is
shown
below
this
code
will
make
both
a
number
and
a
word
and
show
them
both
using
only
one
variable
in
a
statically
typed
language
like
c
a
programmer
would
have
to
say
whether
x
was
a
number
or
a
word
before
c
would
let
the
programmer
set
up
x
and
after
that
c
would
not
allow
its
type
to
change
from
a
number
to
a
word
the
ancient
greeks
had
comedies
which
were
presented
in
competitions
at
the
festival
of
dionysia
one
of
the
best-known
comedy
authors
of
the
time
was
aristophanes
about
–
bc
one
of
his
works
the
clouds
was
performed
bc
the
work
did
not
survive
completely
but
a
later
version
did
survive
it
is
a
satire
against
socrates
and
pictures
the
great
philosopher
as
a
swaggering
con
artist
some
of
the
accusations
were
re-used
at
socrates'
trial
twenty
years
later
typical
for
satire
are
that
the
author
criticizes
society
and
living
people
another
type
of
ancient
greek
theatre
was
the
satyr
play
this
was
mock
drunkenness
brazen
sexuality
including
phallic
props
pranks
sight
gags
and
general
merriment
the
modern
equivalent
would
be
knock-about
comedy
humour
or
'new
comedy'
is
not
about
criticizing
people
or
ideas
but
rather
about
showing
characters
in
funny
situations
the
most
important
greek
playwright
of
this
type
was
probably
menander
the
best
known
roman
comedy
writer
was
plautus
he
often
used
greek
comedies
for
his
plays
many
comedy
plays
were
written
in
the
by
the
british
writer
william
shakespeare
shakespeare's
comedy
plays
include:
all’s
well
that
ends
well
the
comedy
of
errors
a
midsummer
nights
dream
and
twelfth
night
in
shakespeare's
day
a
comedy
did
not
mean
a
play
that
would
make
people
laugh
or
that
had
a
lot
of
jokes
instead
it
was
a
play
in
which
all
the
problems
work
out
all
right
in
the
end
this
was
unlike
a
tragedy
where
the
problems
do
not
work
out
usually
resulting
in
someone's
death
the
two
masks
one
was
smiling
the
other
crying

associated
with

before

china
there
were
hundreds
of
small
states
that
fought
each

for
hundreds
of
years
in
a
war
to
control
china
this
is
known
as
the
warring
states
period
although
the
continuing
wars
made
people
suffer
it
was
at
this
time
when
many
of
the
great
philosophies
of
the
east
were
born
including
confucianism

confucianism

alone
have
been
the

cultures
today
its
geography
mostly
looked
like
that
of
modern
china
except
with
northern
and
western
edges
that
varied
it
was
often
attacked
by
northern
nomadic
people
such
as
the
turkic
tribes
and
the
mongols
lead
by
genghis
khan
and
kublai
khan
during
the
history
of

the
northern
nomadic
people
and
the
chinese
people
had
been
fighting
each
other
and
taking
turns
to
rule
the
land
and
the
people
of
china
however
when
the
northern
people
beat
the
chinese
people
and
came
to
rule
the
kingdom
they
also
incorporated
the
chinese
way
of
living
and
became
like
the
chinese
many
of

dynasties
of

were
ruled
by
the
northern
people
including
the
qin
tang
yuan
mongolian
and

nd
millennium
it
became
an

this
was
because

bought
by

european
powers
started
to
take

other
countries
in

while
china
was
never
actually
taken
over
by
europeans
many
european
countries
such
as

influence
in

cut
itself
off
from
the

over
the
previous
few
centuries
by
the
qing
dynasty
it
had
fallen
behind
other
countries
in
technology
and
was
helpless
to
stop
this
from
happening
this
had
become
clear
when
it
lost
the
opium
wars

hearing
the

join
the

columbus
was
not
literally
the
first
european
person
to
have
discovered
america
at
the
time
of
his
voyage
the
americas
were
not
known
to
have
existed
however
leif
erikson
around
ad
had
landed
in
present-day
canada
this
discovery
had
no
impact
on
european
history
and
was
not
well
documented
columbus
discovered
america
in
the
sense
that
he
was
the
first
person
to
create
repeated
exploration
and
contact
with
the
new
world
another
point
is
that
native
americans
had
been
living
there
for
thousands
of
years
before
he
arrived
however
native
americans
did
not
record
or
contribute
to
the
european
record
of
history
for
obvious
reasons
columbus
therefore
discovered
america
in
context
of
european
history
many
people
in
western
europe
wanted
to
find
a
shorter
way
to
get
to
asia
columbus
thought
he
could
get
to
asia
by
sailing
west
he
did
not
know
about
the
countries
in
the
western
hemisphere
so
he
did
not
realize
they
would
block
him
from
getting
to
asia
however
columbus
did
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
for
this
voyage
on
his
own
after
defeating
the
emirate
of
granada
the
rulers
of
spain
ferdinand
ii
and
isabella
i
of
castile
agreed
to
pay
for
the
voyage
he
promised
to
bring
back
gold
and
spices
for
them
in
august
columbus
and
his
sailors
left
spain
in
three
ships:
the
santa
maría
the
holy
mary
the
pinta
the
painted
and
the
santa
clara
nicknamed
the
niña:
the
little
girl
the
three
ships
were
very
small
historians
think
that
the
largest
ship
the
santa
maría
was
only
about
feet
metres
long
and
about
to
feet
to
metres
wide
columbus's
other
ships
were
even
smaller
historians
think
they
were
about
–
feet
–
metres
long
on
october
after
sailing
for
about
four
months
columbus
landed
on
a
small
island
in
the
bahamas
the
natives
called
it
guanahani
columbus
renamed
it
san
salvador
island
holy
savior
he
met
arawak
and
taíno
native
americans
who
lived
on
the
island
they
were
friendly
and
peaceful
towards
columbus
and
his
crew
not
knowing
where
he
was
and
thinking
that
he
had
reached
asia
the
indies
he
called
them
indians
he
claimed
their
land
as
spain's
columbus
then
sailed
to
what
is
now
cuba
then
to
hispaniola
on
hispaniola
columbus
built
a
fort
this
was
one
of
the
first
european
military
bases
in
the
western
hemisphere
he
called
it
navidad
spanish
for
christmas
he
left
thirty-nine
crew
members
there
and
ordered
them
to
find
and
store
the
gold
on
the
day
he
landed
in
the
bahamas
columbus
wrote
about
the
arawaks
and
taíno:
columbus
noticed
that
some
of
the
arawaks
had
gold
earrings
he
took
some
of
them
as
prisoners
and
ordered
them
to
lead
him
to
the
gold
however
they
could
not
according
to
encyclopædia
britannica:
on
september
columbus
left
spain
with
enough
ships
supplies
and
men
to
invade
and
make
spanish
colonies
in
the
new
world
he
had
ships
and
men
these
men
included
soldiers
and
farmers
there
were
also
priests
whose
job
was
to
convert
the
natives
to
christianity
on
this
voyage
columbus
explored
some
of
the
islands
of
the
lesser
antilles
he
also
sailed
around
most
of
hispaniola
and
explored
the
sides
of
jamaica
and
cuba
he
had
not
seen
on
his
first
voyage
then
he
went
back
to
the
navidad
fort
he
found
the
fort
burned
down
eleven
of
the
soldiers
columbus
left
at
the
fort
were
buried
there
the
rest
had
disappeared
historians
think
this
happened
because
of
disease
and
fights
with
the
arawak
people
while
columbus
was
away
from
navidad
exploring
jamaica
and
cuba
his
soldiers
stopped
working
on
building
a
new
fort
and
farms
they
made
the
arawaks
give
them
food
they
also
stole
things
from
the
arawaks
and
raped
arawak
women
this
made
the
arawaks
decide
to
fight
back
against
the
spaniards
however
spain
had
many
weapons
that
the
arawaks
had
never
seen
including
steel
swords
pikes
crossbows
dogs
and
horses
this
made
it
much
easier
for
spain
to
win
fights
against
the
arawaks
columbus
also
took
revenge
against
the
arawaks
for
killing
his
soldiers
at
navidad
he
made
every
native
older
than
give
him
a
certain
amount
of
gold
every
three
months
if
a
person
did
not
do
this
columbus's
men
would
cut
off
their
hands
and
they
would
bleed
to
death
historian
carl
lehrburger
says
that
about
natives
died
this
way
columbus
also
led
his
soldiers
to
many
different
villages
in
hispaniola
to
take
them
over
and
make
them
pay
him
gold
also
if
they
could
not
pay
the
gold
people
would
be
made
into
slaves
or
killed
there
was
not
much
gold
on
the
parts
of
the
island
columbus
took
over
to
avoid
getting
their
hands
cut
off
many
arawaks
tried
to
run
away
from
columbus
and
his
men
however
columbus's
soldiers
used
dogs
to
hunt
them
down
and
kill
them
bartolomé
de
las
casas
said
that
the
spanish
killed
two
out
of
every
three
native
people
in
the
area
though
he
may
have
been
exaggerating
in
february
columbus
started
the
transatlantic
slave
trade
he
and
his
soldiers
captured
about
taíno
only
could
fit
on
columbus's
ships
so
columbus
told
his
men
they
could
take
any
of
the
rest
as
slaves
they
took
and
let
go
of
the
natives
that
columbus
shipped
to
spain
as
slaves
about
died
on
the
trip
half
of
the
rest
were
very
sick
when
they
arrived
this
was
the
first
time
people
had
ever
been
shipped
across
the
atlantic
ocean
to
be
sold
as
slaves
michele
da
cuneo
a
friend
of
columbus's
helped
capture
natives
as
slaves
in
a
letter
da
cuneo
later
wrote
that
columbus
gave
him
a
captured
native
woman
to
rape:
columbus
went
on
another
voyage
in
king
john
ii
of
portugal
had
said
there
was
a
continent
to
the
south-west
of
the
cape
verde
islands
on
his
third
voyage
columbus
wanted
to
find
this
continent
before
the
voyage
queen
isabella
reminded
columbus
that
he
should
treat
all
of
the
native
people
well
and
make
them
into
christians
on
this
voyage
columbus
sent
three
ships
straight
to
the
west
indies
the
caribbean
he
led
another
three
ships:
first
to
two
portuguese
islands
then
to
the
canary
islands
then
cape
verde
from
cape
verde
they
sailed
to
the
northern
coast
of
south
america
and
landed
in
trinidad
he
also
explored
part
of
south
america
and
the
islands
now
called
tobago
and
grenada
on
august
columbus
returned
to
hispaniola
he
found
that
many
of
the
spanish
settlers
there
were
unhappy
they
thought
there
would
be
more
gold
in
the
new
world
some
of
them
had
rebelled
while
he
was
gone
columbus
had
five
of
the
rebellion's
leaders
hanged
he
also
tried
to
make
the
rest
of
the
settlers
happy
by
giving
them
land
in
hispaniola
however
the
settlers
kept
sending
complaints
to
spain
in
queen
isabella
sent
a
man
named
francisco
de
bobadilla
to
hispaniola
she
gave
him
the
power
to
do
whatever
he
thought
he
should
do
when
he
arrived
in
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
have
columbus
arrested
and
sent
back
to
spain
in
chains
when
he
was
trying
to
make
spanish
settlers
happy
columbus
started
the
encomienda
system
in
hispaniola
under
this
system
columbus
would
give
a
piece
of
land
in
hispaniola
to
an
individual
spanish
settler
sometimes
he
would
give
away
a
whole
native
village
any
natives
that
lived
in
that
area
had
to
work
for
that
spanish
settler
natives
had
lived
on
this
land
for
centuries
columbus
was
giving
their
land
away
and
then
forcing
them
to
work
on
that
land
on
august
columbus
was
arrested
in
hispañola
now
called
santo
domingo
for
cruelty
to
natives
and
spaniards
he
was
sent
to
spain
in
chains
in
october
he
was
released
on
december
and
taken
to
court
columbus
had
important
friends
and
the
king
restored
his
freedom
he
was
not
made
governor
again
but
eventually
he
was
allowed
to
lead
another
voyage
columbus
died
of
heart
failure
and
arthritis
in
valladolid
spain
at
the
possible
age
of
columbus's
relatives
said
that
columbus
was
born
in
genoa
italy
today
no
historian
can
say
for
sure
where
columbus
was
born
most
experts
think
the
best
evidence
says
he
was
born
in
genoa
however
other
historians
think
columbus
was
born
somewhere
else
like
spain
or
portugal
some
think
he
was
originally
a
jew
who
converted
to
christianity
columbus
wrote
that
he
first
went
to
sea
when
he
was
years
old
in
columbus
married
felipa
moniz
perestrelo
she
was
from
a
semi-noble
family
with
connections
to
sailing
she
died
around
or
while
giving
birth
to
their
son
diego
in
while
in
córdoba
spain
columbus
met
beatriz
enríquez
de
trasierra
they
lived
together
for
a
while
they
had
one
child
named
fernando
columbus
had
a
few
different
goals
for
his
journeys
to
the
new
world
first
he
believed
he
could
find
a
shorter
and
easier
route
to
asia
which
made
things
europe
did
not
he
believed
he
could
find
a
shorter
route
to
china
other
people
had
called
this
belief
absurd
columbus
wanted
to
prove
these
people
wrong
second
columbus
wanted
to
find
gold
gold
was
the
main
kind
of
money
used
in
columbus's
times
in
his
letter
to
spain's
king
ferdinand
and
queen
isabella
columbus
wrote:
“gold
is
most
excellent
gold
is
treasure
and
[the
person]
who
[has]
it
does
all
he
wishes
to
in
this
world
this
means
that
someone
with
gold
can
do
anything
he
wants
to
do
many
historians
believe
that
columbus
wanted
to
become
a
powerful
person
–
and
in
order
to
become
powerful
he
needed
to
find
gold
when
the
spanish
learned
about
the
new
world
many
conquistadors
or
conquerors
went
there
this
led
to
the
spanish
colonization
of
the
americas
the
spanish
conquistadors
first
settled
on
the
islands
of
hispaniola
now
the
dominican
republic
and
haiti
cuba
and
puerto
rico
they
grabbed
as
much
gold
as
they
could
the
spanish
also
brought
priests
and
forced
the
native
americans
to
convert
to
christianity
in
the
united
states
columbus
day
is
a
holiday
that
celebrates
columbus's

on

yuri
married
her
in
after
gaining
his
pilot's
wings
in
a
mig-
post-graduation
he
was
told
to
go
to
luostari
airbase
in
murmansk
oblast
close
to
the
norwegian
border
where
bad
weather
made
flying
risky
as
a
full-grown
man
gagarin
was
metres
ft
in
tall
which
was
an
advantage
in
the
small
vostok
cockpit
he
became
a
lieutenant
of
the
soviet
air

on
november
and
on
november
he
got
the
rank
of
senior

gagarin
kept
physically

his
life
and
was
a
good
sportsman

he
also
underwent
training
for
the

out
of
the
twenty
originally
selected
the
final
choice
for
the
first

was
between
gagarin
and
gherman
titov
because
of
their
performance
in
training
as
well
as
their
physical
fitness
on
april
gagarin
became
the
first
man
to
travel
into
space
launching
to
orbit
aboard
the
vostok
ka-
vostok
his
call
sign
in
this
flight
was

during
his
flight
gagarin
famously
whistled
the
song
the
motherland
hears
the
motherland
knows
russian:
родина

the
first
two
lines
of
the
song
are:
the
motherland
hears
the
motherland
knows/where
her
son
flies
in
the
sky
this
song
was
written
by
dmitri
shostakovich
in
opus
with
words
by
yevgeniy
dolmatovsky
around
the
same
time
some
western
people
claimed
that
gagarin
during
his
space
flight
had
made
the
comment
i
don't
see
any
god
up
here
however
no
such
words
appear
in
the
direct
record
of
gagarin's
talk
with
the
earth
during
the
spaceflight
in
a
interview
a
close
friend
of
gagarin
colonel
valentin
petrov
said
that
gagarin
never
said
such
words
and
that
the
phrase
came
from
nikita
khrushchev's
speech
at
the
fullness
of
the
central
committee
of
the
cpsu
where
the
anti-religious
propaganda
was
talked
about
in
a
certain
context
khrushchev
said
gagarin
flew
into
space
but
didn't
see
any
god
there
after
the
flight
gagarin
became
a
world
famous
celebrity
he
toured
in
many
places
like
in
italy
the
united
kingdom
germany
canada
and
japan
he
did
this
to
promote
the
soviet
union
achievements
in
he
began
serving
as
a
deputy
to
the
supreme
soviet
of
the
soviet
union
he
later
came
back
to
star
city
while
there
he
worked
on
designs
for
a
reusable
spacecraft
gagarin
worked
on
these
designs
in
star
city
for
seven
years
he
became
lieutenant
colonel
or
podpolkovnik
of
the
soviet
air
force
on
june
then
on
november
he
got
the
rank
of
colonel
polkovnik
of
the
soviet
air
force
soviet
people
tried
to
keep
him
away
from
any
flights
being
worried
of
losing
their
hero
in
an
accident
gagarin
was
backup
pilot
for
vladimir
komarov
in
the
soyuz
flight
as
komarov's
flight
ended
in
a
deadly
crash
gagarin
was
banned
from
training
for
and
helping
out
in
further
spaceflight/s
gagarin
then
became
deputy
training
director
of
the
star
city
cosmonaut
training
base
at
the
same
time
he
began
to
re-join
as
a
fighter
pilot
on
march
while
on
a
routine
training
flight
from
chkalovsky
air
base
he
and
flight
instructor
vladimir
seryogin
died
in
a
mig-uti
crash
near
the
town
of
kirzhach
gagarin
and
seryogin
were
buried
in
the
walls
of
the
kremlin
on
red
square
people
are
not
sure
what
caused
the
crash
but
a
investigation
thinks
that
the
turbulence
from
a
su-
'fishpot-c'
interceptor
using
its
afterburners
may
have
caused
gagarin's
plane
to
go
out
of
control
russian
documents
opened
to
the
public
in
march
showed
that
the
kgb
had
changed
their
own
investigation
of
the
accident
in
addition
to
this
one
government
and
two
military
investigations
the
kgb's
report
removed
many
conspiracy
thoughts
instead
of
showing
the
actions
of
air
base
personnel
added
to
the
crash
the
report
says
that
an
air
traffic
controller
made
gagarin
have
old
weather
information
but
by
that
time
of
his
flight
conditions
had
become
very
bad
ground
crew
also
left
fuel
tanks
on
the
aircraft
gagarin's
planned
flight
needed
good
weather
and
no
outboard
tanks
the
investigation
ended
saying
that
gagarin's
aircraft
entered
a
spin
either
because
of
a
bird
strike
or
because
of
a
sudden
move
to
avoid
another
aircraft
because
of
the
old
weather
report
the
crew
thought
their
altitude
to
be
higher
than
it
actually
was
and
could
not
properly
react
to
bring
the
mig-
out
of
its
spin
in
his
book
two
sides
of
the
moon
alexey
leonov
tells
that
he
was
flying
a
helicopter
in
the
same
area
that
day
when
he
heard
two
loud
booms
in
the
distance
his
thought
was
that
the
sukhoi
jet
was
flying
below
its
minimum
allowed
altitude
and
without
realizing
it
because
of
the
terrible
weather
conditions
he
passed
within
or
meters
of
yuri
and
seregin's
plane
while
breaking
the
sound
barrier
the
resulting
turbulence
would
have
sent
the
mig
into
an
uncontrolled
spin
leonov
thinks
the
first
boom
he
heard
was
that
of
the
jet
breaking
the
sound
barrier
and
the
second
was
gagarin's
plane
crashing

race
on
the
sphere
and
cylinder
is
a
work
that
was
published
by
archimedes
in
two
volumes
in
about
bc
on
the
sphere
he
showed
that
the
surface
area
is
four
times
the
area
of
its
great
circle
in
modern
terms
this
means
that
the
surface
area
is
equal
to:
a
=
π
r
\displaystyle
a_s=\pi

\
the
surface

the

\displaystyle

a
sculpted
sphere
and
cylinder
were
placed
on
the
tomb
of
archimedes
at
his
request
archimedes
is
also
well
known
for
being
the
first
person
to
understand
statics
which
is
a
part
of
applied
mathematics
it
has
to
do
with
loads
that
do
not
move
for
example
in
buildings
or
bridges
he
also
understood
and
wrote
about
what
happens
when
things
float
in
liquids
which
is
called
buoyancy
archimedes'
principle:
the
weight
of
water
displaced
by
an
object
equals
the
amount
of
buoyancy
it
gets
it
has
practical
uses
it
can
be
used
to
measure
the
density
of
an
object
and
hence
whether
or
not
it
is
made
of
gold
the
story
of
the
golden
crown
does
not
appear
in
the
surviving
works
of
archimedes
archimedes
may
have
got
a
solution
known
in
hydrostatics
as
archimedes'
principle
which
he
describes
in
his
treatise
on
floating
bodies
this
principle
states
that
a
body
immersed
in
a
fluid
experiences
a
buoyant
force
equal
to
the
weight
of
the
fluid
it
displaces
using
this
principle
it
would
have
been
possible
to
compare
the
density
of
the
golden
crown
to
that
of
solid
gold
by
balancing
the
crown
on
a
scale
with
a
gold
reference
sample
then
immersing
the
apparatus
in
water
the
difference
in
density
between
the
two
samples
would
cause
the
scale
to
tip
accordingly
galileo
considered
it
probable
that
this
method
is
the
same
that
archimedes
followed
since
besides
being
very
accurate
it
is
based
on
demonstrations
found
by
archimedes
himself
archimedes
is
also
famous
as
an
inventor
because
he
made
new
tools
and
machines
for
example
he
made
a
machine
to
lift
water
that
could
be
used
by
farmers
to
bring
water
to
their
crops
this
is
called
archimedes'
screw
archimedes
probably
also
invented
a
machine
to
measure
distance
an
odometer
a
cart
was
built
with
wheels
that
turned
four
hundred
times
in
one
mile
a
pin
on
the
wheel
would
hit
a
-tooth
gear
so
it
turned
once
for
every
mile
this
gear
would
then
make
a
small
stone
fall
into
a
cup
at
the
end
of
a
journey
one
could
count
the
number
of
stones
in
the
cup
to
find
the
distance
archimedes
also
made
a
system
which
one
person
could
pull
a
large
ship
with
just
one
rope
this
was
called
the
compound
pulley
this
is
an
important
machine
which
is
even
today
helps
people
in
everyday
life
although
the
versions
we
now
use
are
much
more
complicated
they
still
work
by
the
same
principle
through
archimedes
also
invented
or
made
many
machines
used
in
war
for
example
he
made
better
catapults
this
was
during
the
punic
wars
which
were
between
rome
in
what
is
now
italy
and
the
city
of
carthage
in
what
is
now
north
africa
for
many
years
he
helped
stop
the
roman
army
from
attacking
syracuse
his
city
one
war
machine
was
called
the
claw
of
archimedes
or
the
iron
hand
it
was
used
to
defend
the
city
from
attacks
by
ships
ancient
writers
said
that
it
was
a
kind
of
crane
with
a
hook
that
lifted
ships
out
of
the
water
and
caused
their
destruction
another
story
about
archimedes
is
that
he
burned
roman
ships
from
far
away
using
many
mirrors
and
the
light
from
the
sun
this
is
perhaps
possible
but
it
is
perhaps
more
likely
that
this
was
done
with
flaming
missiles
from
a
catapult
archimedes
is
thought
to
be
so
important
as
a
mathematician
that
scientists
have
honoured
him:
a
large
hole
or
crater
on
the
moon
is
named
after
archimedes
some
mountains
on
the
moon
are
called
the
montes

curie
was
born
on
november
in
warsaw
poland
she
lived
there
until
she
was
at
the
age
of
ten
her
sister
zofia
died
her
mother
died
two
years
later
marie
curie
was
the
fifth
child
in
her
family
her
original
name
was
marya
her
father
was
a
math
teacher
he
died
when
she
was
as
a
young
girl
she
was
interested
in
physics
she
was
top
of
her
high
school
class
she
graduated
at
marie
taught
school
so
she
could
earn
money
to
go
to
school
in
paris
france
she
also
went
to
an
unaccredited
college
in
poland
eventually
she
left
poland
and
traveled
to
france
under
the
name
“marie
”
in
paris
she
earned
higher
degrees
and
did
her
important
scientific
work
she
founded
the
curie
institutes
in
paris
and
warsaw
curie
did
many
great
things
she
and
her
husband
created
a
theory
of
radioactivity
a
term
made
by
her
and
her
husband
pierre
curie
they
found
different
ways
to
separate
radioactive
isotopes
and
discovered
two
new
elements:
radium
and
polonium
she
used
her
own
studies
in
radioactivity
to
develop
a
new
treatment
for
cancer
these
treatments
used
the
radioactive
isotopes
she
was
the
first
woman
to
win
the
nobel
prize
she
was
the
first
person
to
win
two
nobel
prizes:
one
in
physics
and
one
in
chemistry
curie
discovered
radium
it
is
one
of
the
most
radioactive
and
dangerous
metals
she
shared
this
discovery
with
pierre
curie
and
gustave
bemont
the
three
found
radium
in
they
discovered
it
when
using
a
uranium
ore
it
gave
off
a
lot
of
radiation
they
decided
that
it
was
coming
from
more
than
uranium
the
group
found
radium
in
the
uranium
radium
is
now
used
for
many
different
things
for
example
doctors
used
to
use
it
to
kill
cancer
cells
radium
was
found
in
paint
and
watches
many
workers
who
made
radium-containing
products
developed
bone
cancer
even
though
curie
became
a
french
citizen
curie
never
lost
her
polish
identity
she
graduated
first
in
her
class
in
one
year
later
she
earned
a
master’s
degree
in
mathematics
later
she
met
her
husband
pierre
at
the
municipal
school
of
industrial
physics
and
chemistry
they
were
married
in
july
they
also
started
to
work
together
on
scientific
discoveries
marie
and
pierre
had
their
first
daughter
irene
in
their
second
daughter
eve
was
born
in
pierre
died
on
april
after
he
was
hit
by
a
horse-drawn
wagon
after
the
war
marie
started
to
raise
money
for
a
hospital
the
hospital
raised
money
for
radiation
research
she
was
invited
to
tour
the
united
states
to
recommend
and
speed
up
her
project
she
sailed
for
the
united
states
in
she
collected
enough
money
and
equipment
for
a
new
laboratory
she
then
started
speaking
at
meetings
to
raise
more
money
and
became
a
celebrity
she
also
supported
world
peace
by
serving
on
the
council
of
the
league
of
nations
near
the
curie
and
many
of
her
colleagues
began
to
suffer
from
symptoms
of
cancer
curie
began
to
lose
her
sight
cataract
surgeries
to
try
to
bring
back
her
sight
did
not
help
curie
knew
that
the
element
radium
she
discovered
might
have
been
causing
the
symptoms
but
she
did
not
want
to
admit
it
to
herself
or
others
in
the
early
curie’s
health
started
to
quickly
get
worse
doctors
diagnosed
her
with
pernicious
anemia
pernicious
anemia
is
a
blood
anemia
that
happens
when
someone
is
overly
exposed
to
radiation
the
doctors
didn’t
tell
the
public
or
curie
herself
what
was
going
on
on
july
at
years
old
she
died
in
a
sanitorium
at
the
french
alps
she
was
then
buried
next
to
her
husband
in
sceaux
france
some
people
believe
that
galileo
was
the
first
person
to
build
a
telescope
this
is
not
true
but
he
was
the
first
person
to
publish
his
observations
of
astronomical
objects
through
a
telescope
he
discovered
that
the
milky
way
is
made
of
many
stars
he
discovered
that
the
moon
has
hills
he
found
four
moons
around
jupiter
those
moons
are
now
called
the
galilean
moons
he
discovered
sunspots
which
are
dark
areas
of
the
sun
he
saw
that
the
planet
venus
has
light
and
dark
phases
just
like
the
moon
this
helped
people
to
know
that
the
sun
is
at
the
centre
of
the
solar
system
as
nicholas
copernicus
had
said
galileo
also
studied
natural
forces
and
was
one
of
the
most
important
discoverers
of
the
part
of
physics
that
is
now
called
kinematics
including
the
discovery
of
kinematic
relativity
however
he
is
often
remembered
now
for
things
that
either
didn't
happen
or
failed
a
legend
says
that
he
climbed
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
and
dropped
cannonballs
of
different
weights
to
see
which
would
strike
the
ground
first
even
though
their
weights
were
not
the
same
they
hit
the
ground
at
the
same
time
galileo
found
that
objects
fall
to
the
ground
at
the
same
rate
unless
things
like
wind
resistance
change
the
rate
this
went
against
the
views
of
aristotle
an
ancient
philosopher
whose
theory
was
different
galileo's
findings
were
ignored
by
most
people
and
aristotle's
view
was
still
accepted
as
correct
until
isaac
newton
proved
galileo
was
right
this
also
led
to
newton
creating
his
law
of
gravity
galileo
also
tried
to
determine
the
speed
of
light
he
climbed
a
hill
and
had
an
assistant
climb
another
hill
both
carrying
lanterns
with
closed
shutters
he
then
opened
the
shutter
of
his
lantern
his
assistant
opened
his
own
shutter
when
he
saw
galileo's
lantern
galileo
then
measured
the
time
it
took
for
his
assistant's
shutter
to
open
knowing
the
time
difference
and
the
distance
between
the
hills
he
tried
to
estimate
the
speed
of
light
however
this
did
not
work
galileo
came
to
accept
the
findings
of
copernicus
that
the
sun
was
the
center
of
the
then-known
universe
and
not
the
earth
because
he
promoted
this
and
other
ideas
he
came
to
the
notice
of
the
committee
of
propaganda
the
dreaded
inquisition
the
church
taught
that
the
earth
stood
still
while
everything
in
the
sky
moved
around
it
the
inquisition
ruled
in
that
other
theories
could
only
be
discussed
as
possibilities
not
facts
galileo
said
he
would
obey
he
played
a
major
part
in
the
scientific
revolution
through
this
argument
galileo
later
discussed
the
question
in
his
most
famous
work
dialogue
concerning
the
two
chief
world
systems
published
in
by
permission
of
the
inquisition
his
scientific
writing
was
usually
in
latin
for
hundreds
of
scientists
around
europe
but
this
was
one
of
the
books
he
wrote
in
italian
so
thousands
of
italians
could
read
it
the
book
was
in
the
form
of
conversations
between
three
men
the
man
representing
the
church's
point
of
view
was
called
'simplicio'
church
leaders
who
liked
his
earlier
books
were
angry
at
this
one
the
inquisition
took
action
in
he
was
arrested
and
put
on
trial
they
found
him
vehemently
suspect
of
heresy
they
reminded
him
of
the
fate
of
giordano
bruno
who
had
been
burnt
at
the
stake
for
heresy
on
topics
such
as
transubstantiation
and
the
trinity
bruno
also
believed
the
earth
went
round
the
sun
and
stars
had
planets
the
inquisition
forced
galileo
to
recant
say
he
was
wrong
under
the
threat
of
execution
and
to
withdraw
his
works
from
publication
galileo
spent
the
last
ten
years
of
his
life
under
house
arrest
galileo
continued
to
write
about
physics
and
other
topics

nietzsche
wrote
a
lot
about
how
people
make
decisions
and
about
how
they
live
their
lives
he
attacked
most
of
the
moral
ideas
that
were
popular
at
the
time
because
he
did
not
believe
that
there
are
any
real
facts
about
what
is
right
or
wrong
he
thought
people
should
create
their
own
facts
about
morality
he
also
often
attacked
the
ideas
of
the
christian
religion
-
he
believed
that
the
christian
idea
that
one
should
feel
pity
when
one
sees
weakness
was
unhelpful
according
to
him
weak
people
rely
on
other
people's
love
as
a
way
of
protecting
themselves
nietzsche
believed
that
people
should
be
stronger
than
that
he
thought
that
people
should
be
very
aware
of
their
body
and
of
the
real
world
in
which
they
actually
live
he
told
his
readers
not
to
live
in
a
daydream
or
make
decisions
based
on
unrealistic
thoughts
he
believed
that
ideas
of
heaven
came
from
an
inability
to
cope
with
life
in
the
world
nietzsche
considered
the
world
to
be
one
connected
thing
including
mankind
and
nature
he
invented
the
idea
of
the
will
to
power
this
idea
is
that
everyone
and
everything
is
trying
to
overcome
itself
or
defeat
or
take
control
from
itself
therefore
if
the
world
is
just
one
thing
this
is
the
force
that
makes
the
world
nietzsche
thought
that
human
beings
would
be
successful
at
overcoming
themselves
and
he
thought
that
when
they
did
they
would
be
different
and
better
he
named
the
person
who
would
do
this
someday
a
superman
or
übermensch
in
german
he
thought
that
the
supermen
would
be
stronger
than
normal
humans
and
not
restricted
by
other
people's
ideas
of
right
and
wrong

nietzsche's

some
people
say
that
hitler
did
not
understand
nietzsche's
ideas
but
he
used
them
to
try
to
show
that
his
actions
were
right
hitler
and
benito
mussolini
used
the
term
übermensch
to
refer
to
the
aryan
race
however
he
was
not
popular
among
all
fascists
nietzsche
wrote
in
a
very
fiery
and
exciting
way
however
what
he
wrote
later
in
his
life
became
more
and
more
odd
when
he
was
forty
years
old
nietzsche
went
insane
supposedly
one
day
in
the
city
of
turin
italy
he
saw
a
horse
being
whipped
by
its
owner
and
ran
to
save
it
hugging
it
around
the
throat
after
this
nietzsche
never
wrote
again
and
could
not
look
after
himself
this
illness
may
have
been
caused
by
the
disease
syphillis
or
a
brain
tumour
his
writing
and
ideas
are
still
popular
and
of
interest
to
academics
and
intellectuals
in
the
late
georg
brandes
developed
a
philosophy
called
aristocratic
radicalism
inspired
by
nietzsche's
idea
of
the
overman
nietzsche
is
associated
with
anarchism
but
his
writing
seems
to
have
a
negative
opinion

stretched
from

the

refused

alexander's
surviving
generals
and
heirs
they
fought
and
conquered

the
largest
surviving
piece
was

alexander's
legacy
includes
the
cultural
diffusion
of
greek
ideas
and
language
he
founded
some
twenty
cities
that
was
named
after
him
most
notably
alexandria
in

alexander's
settlement
of
greek
colonists
resulted
in

octavian
came
into

this
was
three
men
ruling
over

and
octavian

and
the
conspirators
led
by
two
of
caesar's
assassins
brutus
and
cassius
at
first
octavian
was
the
junior
partner
in
the
triumvirate
lepidus
was
more
experienced
in
government
and
mark
antony
was
a
fine
military
leader
the
triumvirate
defeated
brutus
and
cassius
at
the
battle
of
philippi
bc
largely
due
to
antony's
leadership
then
they
split
the
leadership
of
the
republic
three
ways
antony
took
the
east
lepidus
took
spain
and
part
of
north
africa
and
octavian
took
italy
antony
followed
in
caesar's
footsteps
by
going
to
egypt
and
becoming
cleopatra's
lover
they
had
three
children
together
his
absence
from
rome
allowed
the
intelligent
octavian
to
build
up
support
the
triumvirate
broke
up
in

and
disagreement
turned
to
civil

in

antony
was
defeated
by
octavian
at

then
at

octavian
was

the
name

august
in

most

his
main
accomplishment
was
the

a

that
lasted

as
a

it

him
as

the

often
used
by

he
gives
an

perspective

this
birthplace
of

is
called
lumbini
in

that
time
a
clan
called

father
was
a
king
named
suddodana

and
his
mother
was
maya
devi
siddhārtha
lived
in
luxury
his
father
kept
trouble
and
hard
work
far
from
him
a
seer
predicted
that
if
siddhārth
stayed
inside
his
palace
his
whole
life
then
he
would
become
a
great
king
however
if
he
left
the
palace
then
he
would
become
a
great
religious
leader
the
king
did
not
want
his
son
to
become
a
religious
leader
he
kept
siddhartha
in
the
palace
for
his
whole
childhood
when
he
was
older
his
father
found
a
woman
for
siddhārtha
to
marry
at
the
age
of
he
married
the
woman
named
yashodhara
and
they
had
a
son
rahul
although
gautama
had
everything
he
could
want
he
still
was
not
happy
he
wanted
to
learn
the
meaning
of
his
existence
it
is
said
that
he
got
out
of
the
castle
against
his
father's
orders
he
saw
the
four
great
sights:
an
old
crippled
man
a
sick
man
a
dead
man
and
a
holy
man
with
no
home
but
in
real
he
became
member
of
shakya
sangh
in
age
of
after
eight
years
shakya
and
koli
dispute
happened
which
was
about
the
use
of
water
of
river
rohini
some
people
of
both
the
sides
got
injured
after
it
in
a
meeting
of
shakya
sangh
they
decided
to
fight
a
war
against
kolis
to
teach
them
lesson
siddhartha
opposed
the
proposal
and
said
war
is
not
a
solution
of
any
problem
we
can
form
a
council
of
some
people
of
both
sides
and
that
council
can
solve
the
issues
almost
all
the
members
rejected
his
opinion
next
day
head
of
the
sangh
said
we
are
going
to
recruit
new
soldiers
for
the
war
and
it
is
essential
for
a
man
who
is
above
and
below
years
again
siddhartha
opposed
the
proposal
head
of
the
sangh
made
him
recall
his
oath
but
siddharth
said
he
will
not
fight
sangh
asked
him
to
choose
fight
for
the
sangh
against
kolis
death
sentence
or
he
will
leave
the
country
social
boycott
of
his
family
siddhartha
said
i
am
ready
for
death
head
of
the
sangh
said
this
step
can
be
harmful
because
kosala
king
will
not
allow
it
if
it
is
your
problem
then
i
may
become
a
monk
and
then
i
can
leave
this
country
kosala
king
cant
do
anything
in
it
said
siddhartha
head
of
the
sangh
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
after
you
leave
we
will
start
a
war
so
that
king
will
not
be
able
to
findout
any
relation
between
you
and
war
head
of
the
sangh
said
next
day
siddhartha
left
his
family
his
land
and
everything
it
was
th
year
of
his
birth
at
that
time
holy
men
were
usually
ascetics
they
hurt
their
bodies
in
order
to
help
their
spiritual
beings
they
do
not
do
things
they
like
so
they
can
defeat
their
desires
the
most
ascetic
kinds
of
holy
men
were
called
jains
they
practiced
self-denial
and
made
themselves
suffer
very
much
they
believed
this
would
free
the
ātman
soul
from
pain
and
sadness
siddhārth
did
these
things
well
eventually
he
was
better
than
his
teachers
he
still
found
no
answer
and
he
left
his
teachers
some
friends
and
he
went
even
farther
he
ate
only
six
grains
of
rice
a
day
he
tried
holding
his
breath
he
became
just
skin
and
bones
and
he
nearly
died
still
he
had
no
answer
siddhārth
started
to
think
again
about
this
path
he
thought
there
might
be
a
better
way
than
hurting
himself
he
found
a
fig
tree
now
called
the
bodhi
tree
and
started
to
meditate
he
told
himself
that
he
would
not
get
up
until
he
had
found
enlightenment
he
meditated
under
the
tree
for
days
his
mind
is
said
to
have
become
pure
and
then
six
years
after
he
began
his
path
he
said
he
found
enlightenment
and
became
the
buddha
when
the
buddha
became
enlightened
he
knew
the
answer
to
suffering
and
he
knew
how
to
defeat
suffering
this
answer
was
called
the
four
noble
truths
he
was
not
sure
if
he
should
teach
his
new
ideas
or
not
he
asked
himself
if
the
world
was
ready
for
such
a
deep
teaching
but
in
the
end
he
decided
to
travel
to
a
town
called
sarnath
to
teach
the
people
his
new
way
he
taught
about
the
four
noble
truths
and
the
noble
eightfold
path
the
people
listened
to
him
when
he
taught
he
did
not
pretend
to
be
a
god
he
said
he
was
just
a
man
who
had
found
the
meaning
of
life
enlightenment
and
that
any
person
can
also
find
the
meaning
of
life
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
walked
all
over
southern
nepal
and
parts
of
india
to
teach
people
what
he
believed
he
started
a
sangha
which
is
a
group
of
buddhist
monks
and
nuns
many
people
became
enlightened
because
of
him
at
the
age
of
gautama
buddha
died
the
teachings
of
the
buddha
are
known
as
buddhism
buddhism
is
mostly
about
ending
the
feeling
of
pain
that
all
people
feel
inside
gautama
buddha
taught
that
pain
is
a
part
of
all
life
he
taught
that
pain
is
because
of
desire
and
he
showed
that
there
is
a
way
to
end
desire
and
end
pain
by
doing
good
things
not
doing
bad
things
and
training
one's
mind
this
is
done
to
end
pain
and
gain
enlightenment
buddhism
teaches
non-harm
and
balance
–
not
going
too
far
one
way
or
the
other
the
buddha
taught
people
to
meditate
or
think
deeply
while
sitting
in
the
lotus
position
some
buddhists
chant
and
meditate
while
walking
buddhists
sometimes
do
these
things
to
understand
the
human
heart
and
mind
sometimes
they
do
these
things
to
understand
the
way
the
world
works
sometimes
they
do
these
things
to
find
peace
the
buddha
would
not
say
if
gods
exist
or
not
he
taught
that
people
should
not
look
to
gods
to
save
them
or
bring
them
enlightenment
the
gods
may
have
power
over
world
events
and
they
might
help
people
or
they
might
not
but
buddha
believed
that
it
is
up
to
each
person
to
become
enlightened

thousands
of
other
people
when
they
got
to
bethlehem
every
room
was
full
jesus
was
placed
in
a
manger
as
there
was
no
room
for
them
at
the
inn
shepherds
who
were
minding
their
sheep
on
the
hillside
came
in
to
see
the
baby
and
went
away
singing
thanks
to
god
for
the
newborn
king
in
the
gospel
of
matthew
it
says
that
wise
men
from
a
far
country
saw
a
new
star
in
the
sky
and
traveled
to
find
the
young
jesus
because
they
knew
that
the
messiah
was
going
to
be
born
under
a
star
and
that
the
star
was
a
sign
that
jesus
was
born
to
be
a
king
most
christians
celebrate
the
day
that
jesus
was
born
as
the
holiday
of
christmas
although
the
gospels
do
not
say
what
day
jesus
was
born
the
date
chosen
was
of
december
because
there
was
already
a
roman
holiday
on
that
day
the
arrival
of
jesus
was
prophesied
by
john
the
baptist
he
baptized
jesus
in
the
jordan
river
during
the
baptism
the
spirit
of
god
like
a
dove
came
down
upon
jesus
and
the
voice
of
god
was
heard
according
to
the
bible
the
spirit
led
jesus
into
the
desert
where
he
fasted
for
days
there
he
resisted
the
devil's
temptations
then
jesus
went
into
galilee
settled
in
capernaum
and
began
to
preach
about
the
kingdom
of
god
he
was
about
years
old
jesus
taught
mainly
by
telling
stories
he
taught
that
god
alone
was
the
true
king
and
that
people
should
love
god
and
love
each
other
as
the
scriptures
told
them
to
do
and
he
taught
his
followers
how
to
pray
jesus
performed
miracles
that
were
signs
of
god's
power
such
as
giving
hungry
people
food
and
wine
healing
sick
people
and
making
dead
people
alive
again
he
also
set
people
free
from
evil
spirits
jesus
gathered
together
twelve
men
known
as
the
twelve
apostles
whom
he
chose
and
trained
to
spread
his
message
he
had
many
other
disciples
including
many
women
but
because
of
jewish
customs
the
women
disciples
could
not
travel
to
distant
places
on
their
own
as
teachers
the
bible
says
jesus
became
famous
he
went
to
jerusalem
where
many
were
visiting
the
city
for
passover
when
they
heard
that
he
was
coming
they
greeted
him
as
if
he
was
a
king
they
thought
he
would
free
them
from
the
roman
rule
but
jesus
rode
into
jerusalem
on
a
donkey
as
a
sign
that
he
came
in
peace
jesus
did
certain
things
which
upset
the
jewish
religious
leaders
they
thought
he
showed
disrespect
for
customs
that
the
jews
had
kept
for
many
centuries
for
example
jews
did
no
work
at
all
on
the
th
day
of
the
week
the
sabbath
because
it
was
a
holy
day
in
john's
gospel
chapter
there
is
the
story
of
jesus
healing
a
crippled
man
jesus
saw
a
man
lying
on
a
mattress
he
healed
the
man
and
told
him
to
pick
up
the
mattress
and
go
home
carrying
the
mattress
on
the
sabbath
was
against
religious
custom
so
the
religious
leaders
argued
with
jesus
about
it
they
then
watched
everything
he
did
and
remembered
all
the
things
that
were
against
the
religious
customs
in
mark's
gospel
chapter
it
says
that
when
jesus
arrived
in
jerusalem
he
went
to
the
jewish
temple
he
became
angry
at
what
he
saw
there
were
people
selling
things
there
and
money
lenders
who
were
cheating
poor
people
jesus
chased
away
all
the
people
who
were
selling
things
he
said
the
chief
priests
and
scribes
had
turned
the
temple
into
a
den
of
thieves
because
they
were
making
money
from
the
poor
and
taking
away
homes
from
poor
women
who
had
no
other
way
to
pay
for
the
temple
worship
the
gospels
say
that
the
temple
leaders
were
angry
and
wanted
to
kill
him
they
told
the
roman
government
that
jesus'
followers
wanted
him
to
become
the
king
of
the
country
and
take
it
over
the
gospels
say
the
roman
governor
thought
that
jesus
should
be
set
free
but
that
the
jewish
leaders
said
if
you
do
that
then
you
are
not
the
friend
of
caesar
caesar
was
the
roman
ruler
the
governor
sentenced
him
to
death
because
his
followers
had
claimed
he
was
king
the
roman
soldiers
killed
jesus
by
crucifixion
he
was
nailed
up
to
a
high
cross
by
his
hands
and
feet
this
was
a
common
way
for
the
romans
to
kill
rebels
and
criminals
jesus'
body
was
buried
in
a
tomb
which
belonged
to
one
of
his
followers
on
the
day
after
the
sabbath
early
in
the
morning
women
went
to
treat
the
body
with
spice
and
perfumed
oil
but
the
gospels
say
that
the
body
of
jesus
was
gone
and
that
he
was
seen
alive
afterwards
this
is
called
the
resurrection
some
people
like
the
disciple
thomas
said
i'm
not
going
to
believe
this
until
i
have
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
but
the
bible
says
that
more
than
people
including
thomas
saw
jesus
alive
again
there
are
many
stories
in
the
gospels
about
what
jesus
did
after
he
was
resurrected
finally
the
gospel
of
luke
says
that
jesus
took
his
disciples
to
a
hill
where
he
blessed
them
and
told
them
to
spread
his
teaching
through
all
the
world
and
that
then
clouds
came
down
and
he
was
lifted
up
to
heaven
most
christians
celebrate
the
time
that
the
gospels
say
he
died
and
was
raised
from
the
dead
as
the
holiday
of
easter
the
christian
church
is
founded
on
jesus
the
things
that
christians
believe
about
jesus
are
based
on
the
four
gospels
of
the
bible
and
on
letters
or
epistles
that
were
written
in
the
st
century
explaining
jesus'
teachings
to
his
followers
jesus
did
not
write
these
letters
they
were
mainly
written
by
a
jewish
man
named
paul
at
first
he
tried
to
stop
christianity
from
spreading
then
he
became
a
christian
himself
and
was
an
important
leader
as
christian
churches
started
in
different
towns
and
countries
paul
wrote
letters
to
them
a
lot
of
the
ideas
that
christians
believe
are
written
in
paul's
letters
there
is
also
lots
of
instruction
for
running
churches
and
families
there
are
other
letters
in
the
new
testament
by
other
writers
including
peter
james
and
john
these
letters
all
help
to
build
the
beliefs
that
modern
christians
have
see
section:
other
views
about
jesus
whether
or
not
jesus
is
god
has
been
argued
about
for
a
long
time
most
christians
including
those
from
catholic
orthodox
and
protestant
denominations
believe
jesus
was
both
god
and
man
jesus
is
described
in
different
parts
of
the
new
testament
as
being
the
word
of
god
the
son
of
god
the
son
of
man
and
god
himself
these
teachings
which
are
believed
by
most
christians
are
not
believed
by
many
other
people
the
islamic
teaching
is
that
jesus
was
a
prophet
but
he
was
not
part
of
god
or
the
son
of
god
in
jesus'
own
time
many
jews
became
very
angry
at
jesus
for
saying
that
he
was
the
son
of
god
and
also
because
his
followers
said
he
was
the
messiah
most
jews
do
not
believe
this
these
bible
verses
tell
the
christian
teaching
that
jesus
is
god:
in
the
beginning
was
the
word
and
the
word
was
with
god
and
the
word
was
god
he
was
in
the

john
:
esv
this
letter
is
thought
to
be
by
the
same
john
that
wrote
john's
gospel
many
christians
believe
that
these
verses
say
jesus
is
god
all
christians
believe
that
jesus'
death
on
the
cross
allows
all
people
to
be
forgiven
by
god
for
their
sins
bad
things
they
have
done
most
christians
believe
that
if
a
person
asks
god
to
forgive
them
he
will
do
so
and
they
will
get
to
live
forever
with
him
in
heaven
many
christians
believe
that
by
the
teaching
of
the
bible
jesus
was
not
only
truly
god
but
also
truly
human
and
that
this
was
part
of
god's
plan
to
bring
humans
closer
to
understanding
him
people
who
do
not
have
christian
beliefs
have
different
ideas
about
jesus
verses
from
the
bible:-
and
the
word
became
flesh
and
dwelt
among
us
john
:in
matthew's
gospel
jesus
is
often
called
the
son
of
man
matthew
has
borrowed
these
words
from
the
old
testament
where
they
are
often
used
to
show
that
humankind
is
very
far
from
god
in
the
bible
god
is
often
praised
and
thanked
for
helping
ordinary
humans
who
are
called
the
sons
of
man
in
psalm
the
writer
king
david
asks
god
what
is
man
that
you
are
mindful
of
him
and
the
son
of
man
that
you
care
for
him?in
matthew's
gospel
:
jesus
says
then
will
appear
in
heaven
the
sign
of
the
son
of
man
and
then
all
the
tribes
of
the
earth
will
mourn
and
they
will
see
the
son
of
man
coming
on
the
clouds
of
heaven
with
power
and
great
glory
like
king
david
in
psalm
jesus
is
making
a
difference
between
his
ordinary
human
life
and
his
great
power
as
the
son
of
god
one
of
the
best-loved
parts
of
the
old
testament
is
a
song
called
psalm
it
starts:
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
want
he
makes
me
lie
down
in
green
pastures
he
leads
me
beside
still
waters
in
the
gospels
jesus
often
spoke
about
himself
as
being
like
a
shepherd
caring
for
sheep
he
called
himself
the
good
shepherd
who
would
even
give
his
own
life
to
protect
his
sheep
he
told
the
jewish
people
referring
to
non-jewish
or
gentile
believers
that
he
had
other
sheep
that
do
not
belong
to
this
flock
john
:
in
one
of
his
last
conversations
with
his
disciple
peter
he
told
him
feed
my
sheep
in
other
words
take
care
of
my
people
in
judaism
from
ancient
times
people
are
seen
as
sinful
or
bad
they
need
to
be
forgiven
by
god
they
believed
that
there
were
two
ways
to
get
god's
forgiveness
by
prayer
and
by
sacrifice
prayer
could
be
done
anywhere
but
sacrifices
were
done
at
the
temple
a
person
would
bring
an
animal
often
a
lamb
or
if
they
were
poor
a
dove
they
would
put
their
hands
on
the
animal
to
lay
their
sins
on
it
then
the
animal
would
be
killed
as
a
punishment
for
the
sin
this
type
of
sacrifice
continued
until
the
temple
in
jerusalem
was
destroyed
in
ad
paying
money
to
the
temple
was
also
a
sort
of
sacrifice
when
jesus
drove
the
traders
out
of
the
temple
they
were
the
people
who
sold
lambs
and
doves
and
the
people
who
exchanged
roman
money
into
special
temple
money
part
of
christian
belief
is
that
jesus
christ
did
not
just
come
as
a
human
person
so
that
he
could
teach
a
better
way
of
life
christians
also
believe
that
jesus
was
the
ultimate
sacrifice
for
the
sin
of
humankind
that
jesus
is
the
saviour:
the
one
who
is
here
to
save
christians
believe
that
unlike
ordinary
people
jesus
was
completely
pure
and
free
from
sin
but
that
when
he
died
on
the
cross
he
took
on
himself
all
the
sins
of
every
person
who
would
believe
in
him
like
the
lamb
sacrificed
in
the
temple
based
on
john's
gospel
christian
teaching
is
that
the
death
and
resurrection
of
jesus
are
the
sign
of
his
power
to
forgive
the
sins
of
any
person
who
turns
to
him
and
truly
asks
for
forgiveness
the
bible
says
that
sinners
who
are
forgiven
should
try
to
live
a
new
life
and
not
go
back
to
their
sinful
behaviour
christians
believe
that
knowing
about
god's
love
helps
people
to
live
a
new
and
better
life
these
are
three
verses
from
the
bible
that
are
important
in
this
christian
belief:-
for
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
only
son
that
whoever
believes
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
eternal
life
john's
gospel
:
jesus
said
to
him
“i
am
the
way
and
the
truth
and
the
life
no
one
comes
to
the
father
except
through
me
john's
gospel
:
if
we
say
we
have
no
sins
we
are
fooling
ourselves
and
not
telling
the
truth
but
if
we
tell
our
sins
humbly
to
god
then
he
has
promised
to
listen
and
to
forgive
our
sins
and
make
us
clean
from
all
our
badness
from
the
first
letter
of
john
some
people
who
are
not
christians
believe
that
jesus
lived
at
the
time
that
the
gospels
say
but
do
not
believe
that
jesus
was
the
son
of
god
or
savior
they
believe
that
jesus
was
an
ordinary
but
very
good
person
a
teacher
and
perhaps
a
prophet
mohandas
gandhi
said
i
am
a
muslim
and
a
hindu
and
a
christian
and
a
jew
even
though
he
was
born
a
jain
muslims
believe
jesus
under
the
name
isa
was
the
second-to-last
prophet
messenger
of
god
they
believe
that
muhammad
was
the
very
last
prophet
they
believe
that
both
jesus
and
muhammad
were
ordinary
men
chosen
by
god
to
be
his
servant
and
teach
the
word
of
islam
muslims
do
not
believe
that
jesus
was
god
or
the
son
of
god
islam
is
strictly
monotheistic:
it
says
that
there
is
only
one
god
muslims
believe
that
jesus
cannot
be
part
of
god
because
there
is
only
one
god
if
someone
other
than
god
is
worshiped
it
is
thought
to
be
polytheism
belief
in
more
than
one
god
it
is
also
thought
to
be
idolatry:
idolizing
someone
other
than
god
islam
teaches
that
jesus
did
not
die
on
the
cross
but
another
man
disguised
as
him
went
on
the
cross
for
isa
qur'an
:
this
is
very
different
from
christianity
jesus'
death
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
christian
belief
about
salvation
muslims
always
say
peace
be
upon
him
after
saying
jesus'
name
as
a
sign
of
respect
in
short
and
arabic
a
muslims
also
accept
some
other
teachings
about
jesus
these
teachings
say
that
jesus
will
return
to
the
earth
in
the
end
of
days
he
will
then
destroy
the
false
messiah
or
anti-christ
before
the
day
of
judgment
muslims
also
accept
jesus'
claims
to
be
a
healer
they
believe
in
the
many
miracles
he
is
said
to
have
performed
like
raising
the
dead
to
life
and
giving
sight
to
the
blind
they
believe
that
all
his
miracles
were
granted
to
him
from
god
the
qur'an
like
the
bible
mentions
the
virgin
birth
of
jesus
but
then
it
says
other
things
about
mary
islamic-maryam
the
bible
says
that
joseph
helped
mary
give
birth
to
jesus
but
in
islam
there
is
no
joseph
instead
mary
walked
the
desert
alone
in
labor
and
found
a
tree
the
angel
gabriel
jibreel
asked
if
she
was
hungry
then
told
her
to
shake
the
tree
and
dates
fell
for
her
to
eat
then
he
asked
if
she
was
thirsty
and
he
said
look
down
at
your
feet
and
there
was
water
and
there
she
gave
birth
to
jesus
qur'an
this
is
why
muslims
fast
and
how
they
break
their
fast
mary
knew
she
had
to
go
back
to
her
town
and
when
she
did
with
jesus
in
her
arms
the
people
were
shouting
at
her
for
adultery
mary
wanted
to
explain
herself
but
the
angel
told
her
not
to
speak
even
though
jesus
was
a
jew
and
his
teaching
came
out
of
the
jewish
religion
most
jewish
people
do
not
believe
that
jesus
was
the
messiah
that
is
promised
in
the
jewish
scriptures
in
the
gospels
it
tells
that
jesus
made
the
jewish
teachers
very
angry
with
his
teachings
it
says
that
part
of
their
anger
was
because
he
told
them
they
were
hypocrites
which
means
that
they
externally
made
themselves
appear
to
be
living
a
holy
life
but
internally
their
hearts
were
far
from
god's
in
the
gospels
the
other
reason
that
they
became
angry
was
that
jesus
acted
as
if
he
was
the
messiah
and
said
he
was
the
son
of
god
this
meant
that
he
was
either
a
terrible
liar
that
he
was
mad
and
just
imagined
it
or
that
it
was
true
but
jesus
did
not
seem
to
be
mad
so
that
left
only
two
choices
if
jesus
was
lying
then
he
was
doing
something
badly
against
the
jewish
religion
it
was
because
of
the
claims
that
jesus
was
the
son
of
god
that
some
of
the
jewish
leaders
wanted
him
killed
and
they
handed
him
to
the
roman
rulers
the
romans
did
not
care
if
jesus
said
something
that
was
against
the
jewish
beliefs
but
they
knew
that
people
had
also
said
that
jesus
was
king
of
the
jews
the
jewish
leaders
claimed
this
was
against
the
roman
government's
laws
although
the
roman
leaders
did
not
agree
they
had
him
killed
to
prevent
a
possible
riot
although
today
and
through
history
most
jews
do
not
believe
what
christians
say
about
jesus
there
are
some
jews
who
do
believe
that
jesus
was
the
messiah
promised
in
the
jewish
scriptures
jews
who
believe
this
are
called
messianic
jews
nearly
all
modern
scholars
both
christian
and
non-christian
agree
that
jesus
was
a
real
person
both
christian
and
non-christian
scholars
base
their
studies
of
him
on
the
gospels
they
are
believed
to
have
been
written
between
-
ad
by
tradition
the
gospels
were
written
by
four
men
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
who
gave
their
names
to
these
books
this
is
the
order
in
which
they
are
arranged
in
the
new
testament
of
the
bible
but
scholars
think
that
it
is
not
the
order
in
which
they
were
written
the
gospel
of
mark
was
probably
written
before
the
gospel
of
matthew
the
four
gospels
all
tell
the
story
of
the
life
of
jesus
but
they
do
it
from
four
different
points
of
view
because
they
were
written
by
different
people
and
each
writer
had
reasons
to
tell
it
in
a
different
way
other
scholars
have
said
that
leaders
in
the
early
christian
church
made
changes
to
the
gospel
writings
these
changes
are
said
to
have
happened
at
different
times
in
different
ways
and
for
different
reasons
for
example
one
story
was
left
out
of
many
old
versions
of
the
gospels
it
is
about
jesus
rescuing
a
woman
who
had
committed
adultery
had
sex
outside
marriage
and
was
about
to
be
killed
st
augustine
of
hippo
-
ad
wrote
that
this
was
probably
was
left
out
because
some
church
leaders
thought
the
story
might
cause
people
to
act
in
a
sinful
way
this
story
is
in
all
modern
bibles
and
is
thought
to
contain
very
important
teaching
for
christians
other
differences
that
can
be
found
in
versions
of
the
gospels
are
mostly
small
and
do
not
make
a
difference
to
what
is
known
about
the
life
of
jesus
and
his
teaching
mark's
gospel
which
is
thought
by
biblical
scholars
to
be
the
earliest
has
the
name
of
a
young
disciple
of
the
apostle
paul
who
is
mentioned
several
times
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
and
paul's
letters
the
gospel
was
probably
written
in
rome
and
is
thought
by
scholars
to
be
from
the
memories
of
jesus'
follower
or
disciple
peter
it
does
not
tell
about
jesus'
birth
it
starts
when
he
was
years
old
at
the
time
when
the
disciples
got
to
know
him
it
shows
jesus
as
a
man
of
action:
going
around
the
country
teaching
and
healing
people
matthew's
gospel
was
written
next
matthew
was
one
of
jesus'
disciples
he
was
a
jewish
man
that
was
hated
by
other
jews
because
he
worked
for
the
roman
rulers
as
a
tax
collector
matthew
tells
that
one
day
jesus
saw
him
sitting
at
his
desk
in
the
market
place
and
said
follow
me
most
biblical
scholars
believe
that
matthew
had
read
mark's
gospel
and
decided
to
fill
in
some
things
that
mark
left
out
because
while
mark
wrote
his
gospel
for
the
church
of
rome
matthew
wanted
to
write
for
jewish
christians
all
over
the
roman
empire
matthew
was
a
well-educated
jew
so
he
knew
the
jewish
scriptures
which
christians
also
use
and
call
the
old
testament
of
the
bible
matthew
knew
the
scripture
teachings
that
the
messiah
or
god's
anointed
one
would
come
in
his
gospel
he
often
mentions
these
teachings
he
also
starts
off
by
giving
a
list
of
jesus'
ancestors
because
this
was
important
to
jewish
readers
the
apostle
luke
was
greek
and
a
friend
of
the
apostle
paul
he
was
a
doctor
luke
came
to
know
about
jesus
from
the
disciples
luke
writes
about
the
birth
and
the
childhood
of
jesus
and
he
says
mary
kept
all
these
things
in
her
heart
and
thought
about
them
luke
was
not
a
jew
and
he
writes
in
a
way
that
is
easy
for
other
people
who
are
not
jews
to
understand
he
explains
jewish
customs
and
laws
he
wrote
a
second
book
called
the
acts
of
the
apostles
which
tells
what
the
disciples
did
after
jesus
had
left
them
it
is
believed
by
scholars
of
the
bible
that
john
was
a
disciple
of
jesus
and
was
probably
the
youngest
of
the
twelve
men
who
were
jesus'
main
followers
he
lived
to
be
an
old
man
and
because
of
his
teaching
about
jesus
he
was
sent
to
a
small
island
called
patmos
john
writes
with
one
particular
idea
in
mind
he
wants
to
prove
to
the
reader
that
jesus
is
god's
way
of
saving
humans
from
the
terrible
problem
of
sin
or
evil
john
starts
by
telling
the
reader
that
jesus
was
and
is
god
john
says
that
jesus
is
god's
living
communication
or
living
word
every
part
of
john's
gospel
is
written
to
show
that
jesus
came
from
god
taught
the
message
of
god
and
is
the
way
for
people
to
understand
god's
love
the
gospels
tell
many
of
the
stories
that
jesus
told
when
he
was
teaching
people
about
the
way
that
god
loved
them
and
the
way
they
should
live
these
are
called
parables
they
include
the
following:
in
this
story
from
chapter
of
luke's
gospel
jesus
shows
what
it
means
to
be
a
good
neighbour
near
the
jews
lived
the
people
called
samaritans
they
did
not
agree
with
each
other
about
religious
teaching
and
were
considered
enemies
one
day
a
jewish
man
was
walking
when
some
robbers
beat
him
up
robbed
him
and
left
him
naked
and
almost
dead
by
the
road
a
jewish
priest
came
along
and
saw
him
he
thought
if
i
touch
that
naked
bleeding
man
i
will
be
unclean
and
i
will
not
be
able
to
go
to
the
temple
so
he
pretended
that
he
had
not
seen
him
another
jew
a
holy
man
came
along
and
acted
in
the
same
way
at
last
a
samaritan
came
along
with
a
donkey
when
he
saw
the
wounded
man
he
stopped
he
washed
his
wounds
with
wine
and
olive
oil
then
he
put
him
on
his
donkey
and
took
him
to
the
nearest
inn
he
paid
the
innkeeper
and
said
keep
him
until
he
is
well
and
whatever
is
owing
i
will
pay
when
i
come
back
this
way
jesus
said
to
the
people
who
were
listening
which
one
of
these
people
acted
like
a
good
neighbour?
they
said
he
that
stopped
and
helped
jesus
said
you
go
and
act
the
same
way
in
this
story
from
chapter
of
luke's
gospel
jesus
tells
how
a
rich
man
had
two
sons
they
would
both
get
a
share
of
his
money
when
he
died
the
younger
son
said
father
give
me
my
money
now
so
i
can
go
and
enjoy
myself
while
i'm
young
he
took
the
money
to
the
city
and
spent
it
all
on
parties
with
his
friends
and
other
sinful
things
soon
he
had
none
left
to
feed
himself
and
was
ashamed
he
got
a
job
caring
for
pigs
a
unholy
meat
to
eat
just
keep
himself
from
starving
he
said
to
himself
i'll
go
home
to
my
father
and
i
will
say
'father
i
have
sinned
please
let
me
be
a
servant
in
your
house'
when
his
father
saw
him
coming
he
ran
along
the
road
to
put
his
arms
around
his
son
the
father
said
bring
the
finest
clothes
kill
the
fattest
calf
to
make
a
feast
when
the
elder
brother
heard
all
this
he
was
angry
and
said
i'm
a
good
son
to
you
but
you
never
even
gave
me
one
little
goat
to
have
a
party
with
my
friends
the
father
said
you
have
always
been
with
me
i
love
you
greatly
and
all
i
have
is
yours
but
my
son
who
was
lost
is
now
found
my
son
who
seemed
to
be
dead
is
alive
be
happy
with
me
jesus
said
that
this
is
the
way
god
loves
and
forgives
his
people
when
they
ask
for
forgiveness
knowledge
in
religion
is
different
in
that
it
depends
on
faith
belief
and
the
authority
of
religious
leaders
not
on
evidence
of
a
scientific
or
legal
kind
there
are
differing
views
on
whether
religious
statements
should
be
regarded
as
knowledge
in
many
expressions
of
christianity
such
as
catholicism
and
anglicanism
knowledge
is
one
of
the
seven
gifts
of
the
holy
spirit
in
the
garden
of
eden
knowledge
is
the
factor
that
made
humans
greedy
and
treacherous
but
in
the
book
of
proverbs
it
states:
'to
be
wise
you
must
first
obey
the
lord'
:
in
islam
knowledge
has
great
significance
the
all-knowing
al-ʿalīm
is
one
of
the
names
of
god
reflecting
distinct
properties
of
god
in
islam
the
qur'an
asserts
that
knowledge
comes
from
god
:
and
various
hadith
encourage
getting
knowledge
muhammad
is
reported
to
have
said
seek
knowledge
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
and
verily
the
men
of
knowledge
are
the
inheritors
of
the
prophets
islamic
scholars
theologians
and
jurists
are
often
given
the
title
alim
meaning
'knowledgeable'
==
references
==
many
people
have
asked
themselves
if
god
exists
philosophers
theologians
and
others
have
tried
to
prove
that
it
exists
and
others
have
tried
to
disprove
the
theory
in
philosophical
terminology
such
arguments
are
about
the
epistemology
of
the
ontology
of
god
the
debate
exists
mainly
in
philosophy
as
science
does
not
address
whether
or
not
supernatural
things
exist
there
are
many
philosophical
issues
with
the
existence
of
god
some
definitions
of
god
are
not
specific
arguments
for
the
existence
of
god
typically
include
metaphysical
empirical
inductive
and
subjective
types
some
theories
are
built
around
holes
in
evolutionary
theory
as
well
as
order
and
complexity
in
the
world
arguments
against
the
existence
of
god
typically
include
empirical
deductive
and
inductive
arguments
conclusions
sometimes
include:
god
does
not
exist
strong
atheism
god
almost
certainly
does
not
exist
de
facto
atheism
no
one
knows
whether
god
exists
agnosticism
god
exists
but
this
cannot
be
proven
or
disproven
deism
or
theism
and
god
exists
and
this
can
be
proven
theism
there
are
many
variations
on
these
positions
and
sometimes
different
names
for
some
of
them
for
example
the
position
god
exists
and
this
can
be
proven
is
sometimes
called
gnostic
theism
or
strong
theism
there
are
different
names
for
god
in
different
religions
some
examples
are
yahweh
elohim
in
judaism
and
christianity
allah
in
islam
baha
in
bahá'í
faith
and
ahura
mazda
in
zoroastrianism
by
the
year
approximately
of
the
world's
population
were
part
of
one
of
the
three
main
abrahamic
religions
christian
islam
less
than
judaism
with
buddhism
with
hinduism
with
traditional
chinese
religion
with
various
other
religions
and
less
than
as
non-religious
most
of
these
religious
beliefs
involve
god
or
gods
abrahamic
religions
are
very
popular
monotheistic
ones
well-known
abrahamic
religions
include
judaism
christianity
and
islam
monotheistic
means
the
people
in
these
religions
believe
there
is
only
one
god
the
name
of
god
is
usually
not
allowed
to
be
said
in
judaism
but
some
jews
today
call
him
yhwh
yahweh
or
jehovah
muslims
say
the
word
allah
which
is
the
arabic
word
for
god
believers
in
the
abrahamic
religions
except
islamic
believers
believe
that
god
has
created
human
beings
in
his
image
but
this
idea
is
not
easily
understood
by
humankind
one
artistic
idea
is
that
of
an
wise
elder
man
in
use
since
the
renaissance
the
christian
holy
bible
talks
about
god
in
different
ways
within
christian
canon
the
old
testament
talks
about
god
the
father
whilst
the
new
testament
is
about
jesus
or
god
the
son
many
christians
believe
that
jesus
was
god's
incarnation
on
earth
christians
consider
the
holy
spirit
to
be
god
as
well
the
third
person
of
god
in
the
new
testament
there
are
three
beings
who
are
said
to
be
god
in
different
forms:
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
spirit
also
known
as
the
holy
ghost
this
is
called
the
holy
trinity
although
the
word
trinity
is
not
in
the
bible
the
word
used
for
god
in
chapter
one
of
genesis
is
actually
plural
and
the
phrase
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit'
is
used
in
the
new
testament
e
g
matthew
:
another
word
that
christians
believe
has
exactly
the
same
meaning
as
trinity
is
the
word
godhead
which
is
in
the
holy
bible
christians
believe
that
god
incarnated
in
a
human
body
through
the
normal
birth
process
normally
growing
up
into
a
man
named
jesus
or
yeshua
coming
to
earth
specifically
to
give
every
person
an
opportunity
of
salvation
from
their
own
evil
called
sin
the
effect
of
personal
evil
far
transcends
the
repercussions
humans
cause
to
one
another
in
the
world
but
affects
one's
relationship
with
god
the
father
and
that
aspect
of
the
self
cannot
be
addressed
through
one's
own
self-improvement
efforts
but
requires
god
to
intervene
in
order
to
set
one
right
when
jesus
prayed
and
talked
to
god
he
called
him
father
and
taught
others
to
do
the
same
jesus
also
taught
that
one
must
be
born
again
in
order
to
receive
god's
spirit
otherwise
one
remains
separated
from
god
acting
merely
from
their
own
mind
thus
being
vulnerable
to
deception
by
human
philosophies
or
the
many
spiritual
philosophies
which
do
not
come
from
god
but
from
fallen
angels
which
are
within
various
false
religions
after
a
person
consciously
accepts
the
free
gift
of
eternal
life
which
jesus's
sacrifice
offers
god
comes
to
live
in
the
individual
as
god
lived
in
humankind
before
the
fall
in
hinduism
there
is
only
one
god
named
brahman
but
brahman
is
said
to
have
taken
on
many
different
incarnations
some
of
these
are
rama
krishna
buddha
shiva
kali
parvati
and
durga
to
many
outsiders
the
worship
of
god's
different
incarnations
is
considered
to
be
the
worship
of
many
gods
however
it
is
really
only
the
worship
of
one
god
in
different
ways
some
hindus
also
believe
that
the
spirit
of
god
lives
in
everyone
this
idea
is
called
advaita
vedanta
which
is
the
hindu
term
for
monism
religions
like
buddhism
and
confucianism
involve
the
worship
of
many
gods
or
sometimes
no
gods
at
all
philosophers
can
talk
about
god
or
god
sometimes
they
talk
about
a
specific
god
but
other
times
they
are
just
talking
about
the
idea
of
god
one
of
the
earliest
western
philosophers
to
write
about
god
in
a
monotheistic
way
was
the
greek
aristotle
who
describes
god
as
the
supreme
cause
aristotle
saw
god
as
a
being
that
makes
everything
happen
but
is
not
influenced
by
anything
else
there
are
also
some
philosophical
problems
with
god
one
of
them
is
called
god
paradox
it
is
a
question
about
whether
an
omnipotent
god
can
make
a

is
so

he
cannot
lift

in
popular
culture
soul
usually
means
deep
feeling
and
commitment
it
is
in
this
sense
that
the
word
appears
in
the
term
soul
music
however
that
music
was
also
influenced
by
gospel
music
which
was
religious
one
popular
idea
about
souls
that
is
easy
to
express
is
that
a
person
is
a
soul
and
has
a
body
the
soul
is
the
i
in
i
exist
that
feels
and
lives
life
what
people
call
the
mind
could
be
part
of
the
soul:
one
soul
started
this
article
other
souls
have
edited
it
and
another
soul
is
reading
it
this
view
however
implies
that
the
human
body
is
a
possession
and
seems
to
devalue
bodies
that
do
not
have
souls
as
defined
or
understood
by
the
speaker
some
people
say
that
animals
heretics
and
people
of
another
religion
do
not
have
souls
like
most
uses
of
the
verb
to
be
there
is
an
ideology
in
these
simple
words
christianity
teaches
that
all
humans
have
an
immortal
soul
this
means
that
it
is
a
part
of
them
which
does
not
die
when
their
physical
body
dies
but
lives
on
with
them
to
heaven
or
to
hell
christians
believe
that
the
soul
is
the
'breath
of
life'
which
god
gave
to
adam
in
japan
the
soul
is
believed
to
weigh
grams
this
belief
may
have
been
influenced
by
the
observations
of
dr
mcdougall
in
the
early
one
distinction
often
made
is
between
soul
which
is
distinct
from
other
souls
and
spirit
which
may
be
combined
with
that
of
other
beings
the
idea
of
the
holy
spirit
in
christianity
for
example
is
a
universal
and
shared
spirit
many
souls
are
part
of
and
which
is
expressed
on
earth
in
that
faith
by
the
church
meaning
the
body
of
christ
meaning
all
bodies
that
follow
jesus
this
could
be
more
inclusive
than
the
is/has
view
of
souls

the
most
important
teachings
of
judaism
is
that
there
is
one
god
who
wants
people
to
do
what
is
just
and
compassionate
judaism
teaches
that
a
person
serves
god
by
learning
the
holy
books
and
doing
what
they
teach
these
teachings
include
both
ritual
actions
and
ethics
judaism
teaches
that
all
people
are
made
in
the
image
of
god
and
deserve
to
be
treated
with
dignity
and
respect
the
three
main
beliefs
at
the
centre
of
judaism
are
monotheism
identity
and
covenant
these
are
some
of
judaism’s
main
teachings:
the
main
teachings
of
judaism
about
god
are
that
there
is
a
god
and
there
is
only
one
god
only
god
created
the
universe
and
only
he
controls
it
judaism
also
teaches
that
god
is
spiritual
and
not
physical
jews
believe
that
god
is
one
–
a
unity:
he
is
one
whole
complete
being
he
cannot
be
divided
into
parts
and
people
cannot
say
how
he
looks
in
words
they
can
only
say
how
he
is
and
what
he
does
jews
believe
that
all
goodness
and
morality
is
from
god
god
is
interested
in
what
people
do
and
he
watches
what
they
do
judaism
teaches
that
all
people
are
made
in
the
image
of
god
this
is
why
people
must
be
treated
with
dignity
and
respect
a
person
serves
god
by
being
like
god
this
means
that
they
must
do
what
is
fair
and
just
show
mercy
and
behave
with
kindness
and
love
for
people
judaism
says
that
god
exists
forever
that
he
is
in
every
place
and
that
he
knows
all
things
he
is
above
nature
“supernatural”
but
he
is
in
the
world
and
he
hears
people
who
pray
to
him
and
can
answer
them
god
is
the
main
power
in
the
universe
judaism
teaches
that
god
allows
people
to
choose
what
to
do
–
this
is
called
“free
will
”
a
person
is
responsible
for
their
actions
god
rewards
people
who
do
good
actions
and
punishes
people
who
do
bad
actions
god
gives
a
person
a
reward
or
a
punishment
in
this
world
but
he
gives
the
final
reward
or
punishment
to
the
soul
of
the
person
after
they
die
jews
believe
that
god
made
an
agreement
called
a
“covenant”
with
abraham
the
ancestor
of
the
jewish
people
the
bible
says
that
god
promised
to
bless
abraham
and
his
descendants
if
they
worshipped
god
and
were
faithful
to
him
god
made
this
covenant
with
abraham's
son
isaac
and
with
isaac's
son
jacob
god
gave
jacob
another
name
–
israel
this
is
how
jacob’s
descendants
got
the
name
the
“children
of
israel”
or
“israelites
”
god
later
gave
the
torah
to
the
israelites
through
their
leader
moses
the
torah
told
the
israelites
how
to
live
and
build
their
community
god
gave
the
israelites
the
ten
commandments
and
other
laws
in
the
torah
the
jews
are
sometimes
called
the
“chosen
people
”
this
is
because
the
bible
says
god
told
them
“you
will
be
to
me
a
kingdom
of
priests
and
a
holy
nation”
exodus
:
and
“for
you
are
a
holy
people
to
the
lord
your
god
and
the
lord
chose
you
to
be
his
own
special
nation
out
of
all
peoples
on
the
earth”
deuteronomy
:
jews
understand
this
means
that
they
have
special
duties
and
responsibilities
commanded
by
god
for
example
jews
must
build
a
just
society
and
serve
only
god
jews
believe
that
this
covenant
works
in
two
ways:
if
they
follow
god’s
laws
he
will
give
them
his
love
and
protection
but
they
are
also
responsible
for
their
sins
–
bad
actions
–
and
not
doing
what
god
told
them
jews
believe
that
they
must
teach
other
people
that
god
exists
and
that
god
wants
all
people
to
do
good
actions
jews
believe
that
their
job
in
the
world
is
to
be
a
light
to
the
nations
isiah
:
by
showing
the
people
of
the
world
ways
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
jews
believe
that
god
has
given
them
a
special
job
to
repair
the
world
their
job
is
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
with
more
good
in
it
they
must
use
the
things
in
the
world
to
increase
good
and
come
closer
to
god
they
call
this
“tikkun
olam”
–
repairing
the
world
jews
see
themselves
as
god’s
partner
to
repair
the
world
in
any
way
they
can
–
to
find
ways
to
lessen
suffering
of
people
and
animals
to
make
more
peace
and
respect
between
people
and
protect
the
earth’s
environment
from
destruction
jews
do
not
try
to
convince
other
people
to
believe
in
judaism
jews
believe
they
have
a
special
job
to
show
all
peoples
that
god
exists
but
people
do
not
have
to
be
jewish
to
follow
god
all
people
can
serve
god
by
following
the
seven
commandments
rules
given
to
noah
but
judaism
accepts
people
who
choose
to
change
their
religion
to
judaism
jews
believe
that
god
tells
them
in
the
torah
the
way
of
life
that
they
must
follow
the
torah
says
god
wants
the
people
of
israel
to
walk
in
his
ways
to
love
him
and
to
serve
him
and
to
keep
god’s
commandments
deut
:–
actions
are
more
important
than
beliefs
and
beliefs
must
be
made
into
actions
these
actions
are
called
“mitzvot”
in
hebrew
singular:
a
mitzvah
sometimes
they
are
called
“laws”
rules
or
“commandments”
many
people
think
of
a
mitzvah
as
a
good
act
or
a
good
thing
to
do
there
are
mitzvot
in
the
torah
jews
believe
that
the
torah
gives
mitzvot
for
all
people
all
people
must
keep
seven
laws
that
were
taught
to
noah
and
his
children
after
the
flood
the
jews
must
keep
mitzvot
which
are
listed
in
the
torah
the
rabbis
counted
mitzvot
that
jews
must
not
do
negative
mitzvot
and
mitzvot
that
jews
must
do
positive
mitzvot
some
mitzvot
are
for
everyday
life
and
some
are
only
for
special
times
such
as
jewish
holidays
many
of
the
mitzvot
are
about
the
holy
temple
in
jerusalem
and
cannot
be
done
now
since
the
temple
was
destroyed
some
of
the
mitzvot
are
about
how
people
must
act
to
other
people
for
example
they
must
give
charity
to
a
poor
person
or
help
a
person
who
is
in
danger
they
must
not
steal
or
lie
these
are
ethical
and
moral
mitzvot
some
mitzvot
are
about
how
people
must
act
towards
god
for
example
they
must
respect
god’s
name
or
not
work
on
the
sabbath
these
are
religious
or
ritual
mitzvot
jews
believe
that
god
tells
them
to
do
both
ethical
and
religious
acts
jews
see
mitzvot
as
acts
that
sanctify
–
bring
holiness
–
to
the
world
and
bring
people
and
the
world
closer
to
god
jews
do
the
mitzvot
to
sanctify
the
physical
world
and
the
things
in
it
such
as
food
and
drink
clothing
and
natural
activities
such
as
sex
work
or
seeing
beautiful
sights
before
doing
many
acts
such
as
eating
jews
say
a
blessing
–
a
short
prayer
–
that
god
makes
and
gives
a
person
the
things
that
they
need
for
life
in
judaism
life
is
most
holy
and
important
a
jew
must
stop
doing
other
mitzvot
of
the
torah
to
help
save
another
person’s
life
jews
believe
that
they
must
do
the
mitzvot
with
happiness
and
joy
because
the
bible
says
“serve
god
with
joy
come
before
god
with
singing”
psalms
:
doing
a
mitzvah
helps
a
person
come
close
to
god
and
that
makes
the
person
happy
a
group
of
jews
called
the
hasidim
say
this
is
the
best
way
to
live
they
say
that
worrying
takes
people
away
from
joy
and
they
will
not
see
the
beauty
and
good
in
the
world
many
mitzvot
in
the
torah
are
about
the
land
of
israel
the
talmud
and
later
books
call
these
mitzvot
“commandments
connected
to
the
land”
because
jews
can
only
do
them
in
the
land
of
israel
for
example
jews
give
gifts
to
the
poor
or
the
priests
from
their
fields
every
year
take
fruit
or
animals
to
the
temple
in
jerusalem
and
must
stop
working
on
the
land
every
seven
years
the
“shmittah”
–
sabbatical
year
the
land
of
israel
is
holy
in
judaism
a
jewish
belief
is
that
god
created
the
earth
from
mount
moriah
in
jerusalem
in
the
land
of
israel
and
he
is
always
closest
to
this
land
jews
believe
that
this
land
is
where
god
told
the
jewish
people
to
build
a
society
to
serve
him
and
many
mitzvot
commandments
in
the
torah
are
about
the
land
of
israel
the
jewish
people
believe
their
history
as
a
nation
begins
with
abraham
the
story
of
abraham
in
the
torah
begins
when
god
tells
abraham
to
leave
his
country
he
promises
abraham
and
his
descendants
a
new
home
in
the
land
of
canaan
this
is
now
known
as
the
land
of
israel
it
is
named
after
abraham's
grandson
jacob
who
was
also
called
israel
and
who
was
the
father
of
the
twelve
tribes
this
is
where
the
name
“land
of
israel”
comes
from
the
land
is
also
called
“the
promised
land”
because
in
the
torah
god
promises
to
give
the
land
to
the
children
of
abraham
gen
:
gen
:
gen
:
gen
:
the
rabbis
of
the
talmud
understood
from
the
torah
num
:
that
it
is
a
“mitzvah”
for
jews
to
live
in
the
land
of
israel
they
saw
living
outside
of
israel
as
not
natural
for
a
jew
jews
often
called
the
land
outside
of
israel
galut
this
is
usually
translated
as
diaspora
a
place
where
people
are
scattered
but
the
word
more
closely
means
exile
the
story
of
going
out
of
egypt
called
the
exodus
is
very
important
in
the
way
the
jewish
people
understand
the
world
the
torah
tells
how
god
took
a
group
of
slaves
–
the
israelites
–
from
slavery
and
tells
them
how
to
be
his
partner
to
build
the
world
jews
see
this
story
as
a
model
for
the
whole
world
in
the
future
the
whole
world
will
change
and
all
the
people
of
the
world
will
serve
the
one
god
this
will
be
god’s
kingdom
on
earth
the
whole
of
jewish
history
–
and
world
history
–
is
part
of
this
process
the
prophets
taught
that
god
would
send
a
person
to
the
world
who
would
help
all
the
people
of
the
world
see
that
god
is
the
maker
and
king
of
the
world
this
person
is
called
the
messiah
the
word
messiah
comes
from
the
hebrew
word
mashiah
which
means
the
anointed
one
the
book
of
isaiah
says
the
messiah
will
be
a
just
king
who
will
unite
the
jewish
people
and
lead
them
in
god's
way
the
messiah
will
also
unite
all
the
people
of
the
world
to
serve
god
people
will
act
with
justice
and
kindness
and
the
whole
world
will
be
filled
with
peace
jews
still
wait
for
the
messiah
to
come
they
believe
that
this
will
be
a
person
other
jews
believe
in
a
future
time
when
justice
and
peace
will
come
through
the
cooperation
of
all
people
and
the
help
of
god
jews
believe
that
to
know
what
god
wants
them
to
do
they
must
study
the
books
of
torah
and
its
laws
and
do
what
they
teach
these
include
both
laws
about
how
to
behave
to
other
people
and
how
to
serve
god
the
two
most
important
groups
of
books
in
judaism
are
the
bible
and
the
talmud
the
beliefs
and
actions
of
judaism
come
from
these
books
jewish
teachers
and
scholars
wrote
more
books
called
commentaries
they
explain
and
say
more
about
what
is
written
in
the
bible
and
talmud
the
torah
is
the
most
important
of
all
jewish
writings
the
first
five
books
of
the
hebrew
bible
known
to
christians
as
the
old
testament
make
up
the
torah
the
torah
contains
the
basic
laws
of
judaism
and
describes
the
history
of
the
jews
until
the
death
of
moses
jewish
tradition
says
that
god
told
moses
what
to
write
in
the
torah
which
is
also
called
the
five
books
of
moses
religious
jews
believe
that
moses
brought
the
ten
commandments
and
the
torah
down
from
mount
sinai
the
ten
commandments
are
special
because
they
were
heard
by
all
of
the
jewish
people
at
mount
sinai
however
in
traditional
judaism
all
of
the
mitzvot
in
the
torah
are
equally
important
jews
divide
the
hebrew
bible
into
three
parts
and
call
it
the
tanakh
the
three
parts
are
the
torah
which
is
the
first
five
books
the
nevi'im
which
are
the
books
of
the
prophets
and
the
ketuvim
meaning
the
writings
which
are
other
books
of
history
and
moral
teachings
rabbinic
jews
also
believe
that
there
is
another
part
of
the
torah
besides
the
books
of
moses
it
is
called
the
mishnah
also
called
the
oral
torah
or
oral
law
it
explains
how
to
follow
the
laws
written
in
the
books
there
is
a
commentary
explanation
of
the
mishnah
called
the
gemara
together
the
mishna
and
the
gemara
make
up
the
talmud
karaite
jews
however
believe
that
there
is
no
additional
torah
besides
the
books
of
moses
traditional
jews
believe
that
god
gave
the
written
torah
and
the
oral
torah
to
moses
and
that
moses
told
it
to
the
jewish
people
and
that
it
is
the
same
today
as
it
was
back
then
traditional
jews
also
believe
that
all
of
the
commandments
must
still
be
followed
today
liberal
jews
believe
that
the
torah
was
inspired
by
god
but
written
by
human
beings
liberal
jews
believe
that
all
of
the
ethical
laws
in
the
torah
must
still
be
followed
but
many
ritual
laws
do
not
need
to
be
followed
today
it
is
considered
good
in
judaism
to
talk
about
the
commandments
and
to
try
to
understand
how
to
follow
them
the
talmud
has
many
stories
about
rabbis
who
argued
about
the
commandments
over
time
some
opinions
have
become
the
rule
for
everyone
some
rules
are
still
being
argued
about
jews
praise
logical
argument
and
looking
for
truth
there
is
no
single
leader
of
judaism
who
can
decide
how
to
follow
the
commandments
or
what
to
believe
even
though
jews
believe
different
things
and
they
disagree
about
the
rules
they
are
still
one
religion
and
one
people
jews
who
follow
the
religious
rules
called
kashrut
only
eat
some
types
of
food
that
are
prepared
by
special
rules
food
that
a
jew
can
eat
is
called
kosher
food
traditional
jews
are
very
careful
about
kashrut
they
usually
cannot
eat
many
foods
in
non-kosher
restaurants
or
in
the
home
of
someone
who
does
not
keep
kosher
sometimes
this
makes
it
hard
to
visit
people
or
to
do
business
it
is
important
to
understand
that
this
is
part
of
their
religion
people
help
avoid
this
problem
by
choosing
to
dine
with
traditional
jews
in
a
kosher
restaurant
or
serve
them
kosher
food
in
their
home
liberal
jews
are
not
so
careful
about
kosher
although
some
of
them
may
keep
some
rules
jews
can
eat
any
fresh
fruit
or
vegetables
that
do
not
have
any
insects
on
or
in
them
jews
can
eat
any
fish
that
has
scales
and
fins
this
includes
fish
like
salmon
and
tuna
they
cannot
eat
seafood
like
shrimp
lobster
or
mussels
jews
can
eat
meat
of
any
animal
that
chews
its
cud
food
which
has
already
been
partly
digested
and
has
split
hooves
for
example
cows
sheep
deer
and
goats
however
to
be
kosher
it
must
be
slaughtered
and
prepared
in
a
specific
way
jews
can
eat
many
common
birds
such
as
chickens
and
turkeys
and
duck
the
birds
must
also
be
slaughtered
and
prepared
in
a
specific
way
jews
can't
eat
birds
of
prey
like
vultures
foods
sold
in
stores
or
restaurants
must
be
checked
by
a
jew
who
is
an
expert
in
kashrut
the
name
for
this
person
is
mashgiach
or
kosher
overseer
he
makes
sure
that
the
kosher
rules
were
kept
foods
bought
at
the
store
often
have
a
symbol
called
a
hechsher
on
them
to
tell
the
customer
that
the
food
have
been
checked
many
everyday
foods
have
a
hechsher
honey
is
an
insect
product
made
by
bees
but
it
is
kosher
it
is
a
well-known
myth
that
kosher
food
must
be
blessed
by
a
rabbi
some
call
non-kosher
foods
treifah
meaning
torn
this
is
because
the
torah
says
not
to
eat
an
animal
that
has
been
killed
or
torn
by
another
animal
jews
cannot
eat
animals
that
do
not
have
split
hooves
or
animals
that
do
not
chew
their
cud
unlike
cows
and
sheep
pigs
have
split
hooves
but
do
not
chew
their
cud
and
are
therefore
not
kosher
jews
cannot
eat
rodents
reptiles
or
amphibians
jews
cannot
eat
any
sea
animal
that
does
not
have
scales
and
fins
for
example
sharks
eels
crabs
shrimp
and
lobsters
are
not
kosher
jews
cannot
eat
birds
that
eat
meat
like
vultures
which
are
mentioned
in
a
list
in
the
torah
jews
cannot
eat
any
insects
except
for
a
few
types
of
crickets
or
locusts
there
are
other
rules
for
kosher
food
as
well
animals
must
be
killed
in
a
certain
way
including
using
a
fast
strike
across
the
neck
with
a
very
sharp
blade
which
makes
sure
that
the
animal
dies
quickly
all
the
blood
must
be
removed
from
an
animal
before
the
meat
is
eaten
this
is
done
by
soaking
and
salting
the
meat
a
jew
cannot
eat
a
meal
that
has
both
meat
and
milk
in
it
this
comes
from
the
rule
in
the
torah
that
a
jew
must
not
cook
a
young
goat
in
its
mother's
milk
because
of
this
jews
use
separate
dishes
and
utensils
for
foods
that
have
meat
in
it
and
foods
that
have
milk
in
it
after
eating
meat
many
jews
do
not
drink
milk
products
before
a
time
period
between
to
hours
has
passed
kosher
food
must
be
cooked
in
a
kitchen
for
actual
kosher
food
if
the
kitchen
has
been
used
to
cook
non-kosher
food
such
as
rabbit
and
pig
then
the
kitchen
must
be
cleaned
in
a
special
way
before
it
can
be
used
to
cook
kosher
food
one
of
the
commandments
is
to
keep
the
jewish
sabbath
or
shabbat
shabbat
starts
every
friday
at
sunset
and
ends
on
saturday
at
nightfall
shabbat
is
a
day
of
rest
to
thank
god
for
making
the
universe
the
tradition
of
resting
on
shabbat
comes
from
the
torah
according
to
the
torah
god
created
the
world
in
six
days
and
on
the
seventh
day
shabbat
he
rested
many
jews
go
to
their
temple
or
synagogue
to
pray
on
shabbat
religious
jews
follow
special
rules
on
shabbat
these
rules
require
jews
not
to
do
creative
work
on
shabbat
one
reason
for
this
is
to
give
people
a
break
from
all
the
things
that
make
them
busy
during
the
week
this
helps
them
focus
more
on
appreciating
god
their
family
and
the
rest
of
creation
also
it
reminds
people
that
god
is
the
creator
and
ruler
of
the
world
and
no
matter
how
great
a
person's
creative
power
is
it
cannot
compare
with
god's
creation
of
the
universe
and
everything
in
it
many
of
these
categories
of
creative
work
include
actions
that
people
might
not
think
of
as
work
for
instance
on
shabbat
a
jew
cannot:
use
electrical
machines
like
phones
computers
or
a
tv
buy
or
sell
things
put
on
or
off
a
fire
or
a
light
drive
a
car
or
ride
a
bicycle
cook
write
build
or
fix
thingstraditional
jews
are
very
careful
about
shabbat
it
is
a
special
day
they
clean
their
houses
and
prepare
special
food
for
shabbat
they
dress
in
their
nicest
clothes
they
sing
beautiful
songs
and
say
extra
prayers
in
the
synagogue
they
have
dinner
and
lunch
with
their
families
many
families
also
invite
guests
for
dinner
and
for
lunch
they
eat
special
delicious
food
and
sing
together
traditional
shabbat
songs
on

for

most
jews
in
europe
believed
the
same
basic
things
about
judaism
jews
in
other
lands
had
different
beliefs
and
customs
than
european
jews
about
years
ago
a
small
group
of
jews
in
germany
decided
to
stop
believing
in
many
parts
of
judaism
and
try
to
become
more
modern
and
more
like
germans
those
jews
were
called
reform
jews
today
there
are
three
main
kinds
of
judaism:
reform
conservative
and
orthodox
judaism
there
are
also
kinds
with
a
smaller
number
of
people
such
as
reconstructionist
judaism
and
karaite
judaism
each
group
has
its
own
practices
according
to
how
it
understands
the
jewish
laws
some
do
not
believe
in
keeping
most
of
the
laws
for
example:
reform
also
called
liberal
or
progressive
judaism
does
not
require
eating
kosher
food
or
keeping
the
sabbath
at
all
reform
judaism
teaches
jews
to
focus
on
the
ethical
laws
of
judaism
conservative
judaism
developed
after
reform
judaism
the
leaders
of
conservative
judaism
felt
that
reform
judaism
was
too
radical
they
wanted
to
conserve
protect
jewish
tradition
instead
of
reforming
changing
it
orthodox
jews
do
not
believe
that
reform
or
conservative
judaism
are
correct
because
they
believe
that
the
laws
given
by
god
are
timeless
and
can't
be
changed
in
the
most
recent
survey
of
jews
in
the
united
states
in
-
it
was
found
that
of
american
jews
say
they
are
reform
say
they
are
conservative
say
they
are
orthodox
say
they
are
reconstructionist
and
do
not
say
what
type
they
are
in
israel
almost
all
jews
go
to
orthodox
synagogues
there
are
very
few
reform
or
conservative
synagogues
but
there
has
been
an
steady
increase
since
in
israel
jews
do
not
call
themselves
reform
conservative
or
orthodox
instead
they
mostly
call
themselves
haredi
completely
religious
dati
basically
religious
masorati
traditional/conservative
or
chiloni
secular
surveys
suggest
about
of
israelis
say
they
are
secular
say
they
are
dati
or
haredi
and
say
they
are
traditional
names
are
very
important
in
judaism
many
jews
believe
that
a
name
not
only
tells
you
who
someone
is
but
also
tells
you
something
about
them
names
of
god
are
very
special
in
judaism
so
jews
do
not
write
them
or
speak
them
fully
but
use
other
words
instead
that
is
why
some
jews
write
g-d
with
a
-
instead
of
an
o
hashem
means
the
name
it
is
the
word
jews
use
most
often
when
not
praying
to
talk
about
god
adonai
means
my
lord
this
name
tells
jews
about
god's
position
god
is
the
king
of
the
world
and
his
name
adonai
lets
us
know
that
elohim
means
one
who
is
strong
enough
to
do
everything
this
name
is
used
when
talking
about
god's
power
to
create
or
god's
justice
this
tells
us
that
god
is
the
creator
and
that
god
rules
the
world
with
just
laws
the
two
names
above
are
so
special
that
orthodox
jews
use
these
names
only
when
they
pray
and
read
the
torah
when
they
are
not
praying
or
reading
the
torah
they
say
hashem
the
name
or
elokim
god
-
some
jews
write
god
by
replacing
the
o
with
a
dash
like
this:
g-d
they
do
this
because
god's
name
is
very
holy
so
they
are
not
allowed
to
throw
away
a
piece
of
paper
with
god
written
on
it
however
if
by
accident
god
is
written
then
the
paper
can
be
disposed
of
in
a
special
way
and
buried
in
a
special
place
others
say
that
god
is
just
an
english
word
not
hebrew
and
so
it
is
not
holy
yhwh
yehovah/yahweh
is
the
most
sacred
name
of
god
in
hebrew
and
is
not
pronounced
by
most
jews
no
one
knows
where
the
name
came
from
or
what
exactly
it
means
it
looks
like
the
hebrew
word
hayah
which
is
the
verb
to
be
according
to
hebrew
scripture
when
moses
asked
god
who
god
was
god
told
moses
i
am
that
i
am/i
am
who
i
am
jews
believe
that
the
name
yhwh
shows
that
god
is
endless
instead
of
trying
to
say
it
most
jews
say
hashem
which
means
the
name
some
people
pronounce
this
name
as
yahweh
or
jehovah
scholars
of
religion
sometimes
refer
to
yhwh
as
the
tetragrammaton
from
greek
words
meaning
four
letters
three
types
of
family
are:
nuclear
family
single-parent
family
and
extended
family
a
nuclear
family
is
made
up
of
parents
and
one
or
more
children
living
together
a
single-parent
family
is
one
where
there
is
one
parent
and
one
or
more
children
an
extended
family
or
joint
families
means
father
mother
daughters
sons
grandparents
uncles
aunts
cousins
nieces
and
nephews
in
many
countries
including
china
pakistan
and
india
extended
or
joint
families
traditionally
live
together
both
the
nuclear
family
and
the
single-parent
family
are
also
called
the
immediate
family
foster
families
are
families
where
a
child
lives
with
and
is
cared
for
by
people
who
are
not
his
or
her
parents
some
family
members
are
genetically
closer
to
each
other
the
following
table

the
government
tries
to
lead
the
whole
group
governments
do
things
such
as:
decide
which
people
get
which
pieces
of
land
decide
which
people
can
tell
other
people
what
to
do
decide
whether
to
go
to
war
with
another
country
create
money
build
things
for
the
use
of
the
whole
group
such
as
roads
hospitals
libraries
and
docks
educate
people
either
for
their
own
good
or
to
teach
them
what
the
government
wants
them
to
know
take
care
of
the
very
young
the
sick
or
the
very
old
manage
the
welfare
of
the
country
and
manages
the
money
available
for
spending
on
services
hospitals
schools
etc
one
of
the
ways
the
government
leads
the
group
is
by
making
laws
and
rules
which
tell
everybody
what
they
can
and
can
not
do
the
government
makes
these
laws
so
that
society
will
be
safe
and
well-ordered
the
law
that
you
must
not
drink
alcohol
while
driving
a
car
stops
people
from
drunk
driving
which
could
kill
people
the
law
you
must
wear
a
helmet
on
a
motorcycle
makes
sure
that
people
protect
themselves
the
government
can
also
control
people
and
what
happens
in
a
country
in
other
ways
besides
making
laws
for
example
how
the
government
spends
its
money
makes
a
big
difference
in
what
people
will
do
or
what
will
happen
to
people
if
the
government
spends
a
lot
of
money
on
hospitals
and
nurses
the
people
will
probably
become
healthier
also
if
people
like
their
government
or
think
that
their
government
is
wise
they
may
do
something
just
because
their
government
says
it
is
a
good
thing
to
do
governments
often
make
posters
or
television
advertisements
that
encourage
people
to
stop
smoking
cigarettes
or
eat
more
fruits
and
vegetables
politics
is
often
compared
to
ethics
ideas
about
right
and
wrong
ethics
is
a
more
abstract
study
of
right
and
wrong
ethics
is
usually
more
concerned
with
principle
than
law
or
politics
or
diplomacy
so
many
people
think
ethics
is
not
practical
but
without
some
agreement
on
ethics
there
is
probably
no
way
to
even
have
a
debate
laws
or
an
election
there
is
always
some
agreement
on
ethics
and
personal
conduct
in
a
political
system
in
most
countries
people
have
formed
political
parties
to
put
forward
their
ideas
there
is
usually
some
disagreement
between
people
within
a
party
but
they
work
together
because
they
feel
that
they
agree
on
enough
things
and
they
will
have
more
power
if
they
join
together
they
agree
to
take
the
same
position
on
many
issues
and
agree
to
support
the
same
changes
to
law
and
the
same
leaders
an
election
is
usually
a
competition
between
different
parties
some
examples
of
parties
are
the
liberal
party
the
labor
party
and
the
greens
the
greek
philosopher
aristotle
wrote
that
humans
are
a
political
animal
and
that
ethics
and
politics
are
closely
linked
niccolò
machiavelli
wrote
in
his
book
the
prince
that
politics
was
firstly
about
having
and
keeping
power
he
said
that
without
power
a
leader
could
do
nothing
in
thomas
hobbes
wrote
leviathan
a
book
about
politics
hobbes
wrote
that
people
living
in
groups
often
give
up
some
of
their
rights
in
exchange
for
some
protections
from
a
government
in
the
john
stuart
mill
developed
the
liberal
idea
of
politics
mill
said
that
democracy
is
the
most
important
political
development
of
the
he
said
that
there
should
be
more
protection
for
individual
rights
against
the
government
bernard
crick
wrote
a
list
of
the
political
virtues
which
were
about
best
practices
of
politics
itself
there
are
also
disagreements
between
different
countries
attempts
to
solve
the
problem
with
meetings
are
called
diplomacy
this
is
politics
between
nations
instead
of
politics
within
nations
if
the
problems
are
not
resolved
by
diplomatic
meetings
they
can
lead
to
war
or
terrorism
political
economy
constitution
geopolitics
the
idea
of
bartering
things
is
very
old
a
long
time
ago
people
did
not
buy
or
sell
with
money
instead
they
traded
one
thing
for
another
to
get
what
they
wanted
or
needed
one
person
who
owned
many
cows
could
trade
with
another
person
who
owned
much
wheat
each
would
trade
a
little
of
what
he
had
with
the
other
this
would
support
the
people
on
his
farm
other
things
that
were
easier
to
carry
around
than
cows
also
came
to
be
held
as
valuable
this
gave
rise
to
trade
items
such
as
jewelry
and
spices
when
people
changed
from
trading
in
things
like
for
example
cows
and
wheat
to
using
money
instead
they
needed
things
that
would
last
a
long
time
they
must
still
have
a
known
value
and
could
be
carried
around
the
first
country
in
the
world
to
make
metal
coins
was
called
lydia
these
first
appeared
during
the
th
century
bc
in
the
western
part
of
what
is
now
turkey
the
lydian
coins
were
made
of
a
weighed
amount
of
precious
metal
and
were
stamped
with
a
picture
of
a
lion
this
idea
soon
spread
to
greece
the
rest
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
rest
of
the
world
coins
were
all
made
to
the
same
size
and
shape
in
some
parts
of
the
world
different
things
have
been
used
as
money
like
clam
shells
or
blocks
of
salt
besides
being
easier
to
carry
than
cows
using
money
had
many
other
advantages
money
is
easier
to
divide
than
many
trade
goods
if
someone
own
cows
and
wants
to
trade
for
only
half
a
cow's
worth
of
wheat
he
probably
does
not
want
to
cut
his
cow
in
half
but
if
he
sells
his
cow
for
money
and
buys
wheat
with
money
he
can
get
exactly
the
amount
he
wants
cows
die
and
wheat
rots
but
money
lasts
longer
than
most
trade
goods
if
someone
sells
a
cow
for
money
he
can
save
that
money
away
until
he
needs
it
he
can
always
leave
it
to
his
children
when
he
dies
it
can
last
a
very
long
time
and
he
can
use
it
at
any
time
not
every
cow
is
as
good
as
another
cow
some
cows
are
sick
and
old
and
others
are
healthy
and
young
some
wheat
is
good
and
other
wheat
is
moldy
or
stale
so
if
a
person
trades
cows
for
wheat
he
might
have
a
hard
time
arguing
over
how
much
wheat
each
cow
is
worth
however
money
is
standard
that
means
one
dollar
is
worth
the
same
as
another
dollar
it
is
easier
to
add
up
and
count
money
than
to
add
up
the
value
of
different
cows
or
amounts
of
wheat
later
after
coins
had
been
used
for
hundreds
of
years
paper
money
started
out
as
a
promise
to
pay
in
coin
much
like
an
i
o
note
the
first
true
paper
money
was
used
in
china
in
the
th
century
ad
paper
money
was
also
printed
in
sweden
between
and
both
times
it
did
not
work
well
and
had
to
be
stopped
because
the
banks
kept
running
out
of
coins
to

of

is
not
even
things
you
can
hold
it
is
numbers
in

saved
in

many
people
still
feel
more
comfortable
using
coins
and
paper
and
do
not
totally
trust
using
electronic
money
on

types
of

in

these
are:

money
can
be
used
for
other
purposes
besides
serving
as
a
medium
of
exchange
we
say
it
possesses
intrinsic
value
because
it
is
useful
or
valuable
by
itself
some
examples
of
commodity

are

i
the

formed
the
league
of

this
organization
was
a
place
where
nations
could
talk
through
their
differences
calmly
however
some
countries
like
germany
italy
and
japan
ignored
the
league
and
tried
to
solve
their
problems
through
war
members

did
not

to
go
to

young

and
in
a

countries
women
between

and
of
good
health
may
be
forced
by
the
government
of
their
country
to
join
the
military
and
have
military
training
this
is
called
conscription
the
countries
that
do
not
have
conscription
include
australia
bangladesh
canada
france
hungary
india
italy
japan
malta
new

saudi
arabia
slovenia
south
africa
spain
and
the
united

in
some
countries
such
as
argentina
and
united
states
conscription
is
legal
but
is
not
used
at
the
present
time
when
a
person
wants
to
join
the
military
as
a
volunteer
they
enlist
this
means
simply
that
they
put
their
name
on
a
list
they
have
to
be
above
a
certain
age
or
in
most
countries
they
have
to
pass
physical
fitness
tests
to
show
that
they
are
well
enough
to
do
the
jobs
that
they
will
have
to
do
they
must
also
have
good
enough
hearing
to
hear
orders
and
good
enough
sight
to
use
a
rifle
new
people
in
the
military
are
often
called
“recruits”
they
have
training
at
a
special
camp
sometimes
called
“boot
camp
or
basic
training
during
this
training
the
recruits
usually
have
very
little
free
time
they
learn
to
understand
the
orders
or
commands
that
are
given
by
the
officers
to
the
troops
the
troops
are
the
military
people
in
a
group
they
learn
the
right
ways
to
obey
the
orders
they
do
a
lot
of
exercise
to
improve
their
fitness
and
strength
they
learn
about
weapons
first
aid
and
their
uniforms
and
kit
their
kit
is
their
equipment
recruits
also
learn
how
to
march
this
is
the
way
to
walk
together
keeping
in
step
learning
to
march
is
sometimes
called
“drill”
by
the
time
soldiers
finish
boot
camp
they
should
know
enough
to
be
a
helpful
person
in
their
group
the
camp
usually
finishes
with
a
parade
in
which
the
newly
trained
recruits
show
off
their
marching
and
other
skills
they
have
learned
in
front
of
important
visitors
once
the
recruits
are
fully
trained
they
are
ready
to
defend
protect
their
country
from
attack
or
to
go
to
war
if
necessary
from
the
earliest
times
individual
states
or
political
factions
have
used
war
to
gain
sovereignty
over
regions
in
one
of
the
earliest
civilizations
in
history
mesopotamia
they
were
in
a
near
constant
state
of
war
ancient
egypt
during
its
early
dynastic
period
came
about
by
war
when
lower
and
upper
egypt
were
joined
together
as
one
country

sometimes
people
don't
see
a
difference
between
fighting
between
countries
or
people
and
the
formal
declaration
of
a
state
of
war
those
who
do
see
this
difference
usually
only
use
the
word
war
for
the
fighting
where
the
countries'
governments
have
officially
declared
war
on
each
other
smaller
armed
conflicts
are
often
called
riots
rebellions
coups
etc
one
country
may
send
forces
to
another
country
for
a
variety
of
reasons
sometimes
it
is
to
help
keep
order
or
prevent
killings
of
innocents
or
other
crimes
against
humanity
it
may
be
to
protect
a
friendly
government
against
an
uprising
here
it
may
be
called
a
police
action
or
humanitarian
intervention
instead
of
a
war
some
people
think
it's
still
a
war
another
kind
of
war
existed
from
until
called
the
cold
war
this
started
when
diplomatic
relations
between
the
united
states
and
the
soviet
union
broke
down
both
countries
had
nuclear
weapons
and
both
stood
ready
to
use
them
against
the
other
but
there
was
no
actual
war
between
the
two
it
ended
with
the
fall
of
the
soviet
union
in
the
cold
war
was
also
called
a
containment
where
the
united
states
tried
to
prevent
the
spread
of
communism
to
other
countries
during
the
cold
war
the
major
powers
did
not
fight
themselves
but
often
backed
third
parties
in
what
was
called
a
proxy
war
the
vietnam
war
is
often
given
as
an
example
of
a
proxy
war
but
proxy
wars
happened
long
before
the
cold
war
and
are
still
happening
a
war
between
peoples
and
groups
in
the
same
country
is
known
as
a
civil
war
it
is
generally
agreed
there
are
two
things
that
make
a
war
a
civil
war
it
must
be
a
struggle
between
groups
in
the
same
country
or
state
over
political
control
or
to
force
a
major
change
in
the
government's
policy
the
second
criterion
is
that
more
than
people
have
to
have
been
killed
with
a
minimum
of
from
each
side
the
american
civil
war
is
an
example
of
a
civil
war
while
the
figures
are
mere
estimates
the
total
casualties
are
thought
to
be
about
only
in
the
last
years
or
so
have
states
agreed
on
international
laws
to
limit
warfare
this
has
been
mainly
for
humanitarian
reasons
the
geneva
conventions
and
the
hague
conventions
are
two
examples
of
agreements
that
establish
laws
governing
wars
collectively
these
are
usually
called
international
humanitarian
law
ihl
because
these
are
established
laws
they
restrict
those
engaged
in
armed
conflicts
to
follow
the
ihl
also
a
country
must
not
only
respect
the
law
but
they
also
need
to
make
sure
other
countries
respect
it
as
well
they
cannot
turn
a
blind
eye
meaning
pretend
they
do
not
see
a
thing
to
countries
who
are
not
following
ihc
the
first
of
these
was
the
geneva
convention
in
it
became
international
law
with
the
signatures
of
countries
the
statistical
analysis
of
war
was
started
by
lewis
fry
richardson
following
world
war
i
more
recent
databases
of
wars
have
been
assembled
by
the
correlates
of
war
project
and
peter
brecke
peace
the
word
which
is
its
opposite
meaning
-
where
there
is
peace
this
means
that
there
is
no
war
list
of
wars
list
of
battles
there
are
two
schools
of
thought:
partial
writing:
writing
is
any
system
of
graphic
symbols
which
conveys
some
thought
full
writing:
writing
is
any
graphic
system
which
can
convey
any
and
all
thought
ptherefore
depending
on
an
author's
definition
of
writing
the
term
may
be
used
in
different
ways
with
many
early
systems
we
do
not
know
what
they
do
convey
the
central
idea
is
that
a
full
writing
system
must
be
able
to
represent
anything
that
might
be
said
in
spoken
language
p
from
this
point
of
view
the
invention
of
the
rebus
is
an
essential
step
we
can
only
be
sure
a
sign
system
is
full
writing
if
we
can
translate
the
symbols
into
a
modern
language
in
the
case
of
some
ancient
scripts
we
cannot
do
this
writing
was
invented
independently
a
number
of
times
the
sumerian
the
ancient
egyptian
the
chinese
and
the
mayan
writings
are
separate
in
their
invention
p
all
these
writing
systems
started
with
pictographs
symbols
that
stood
for
things
then
they
developed
a
mixture
of
methods
our
own
alphabetic
system
is
different
it
is
based
on
the
sounds
of
spoken
language
all
alphabets
are
modified
versions
of
the
first
one
which
originated
with
the
phoenicians
and
the
ancient
greeks
the
sumerians
lived
in
mesopotamia
between
the
tigris
and
euphrates
rivers
years
ago
this
was
a
fertile
region
and
is
now
mostly
in
iraq
the
sumerians
developed
a
form
of
writing
called
cuneiform
triangular
marks
were
pressed
into
soft
clay
tablets
after
the
clay
had
dried
in
the
sun
the
tablets
were
baked
then
they
were
carried
somewhere
else
for
others
to
read
we
know
that
its
first
uses
were
for
trade
accounting
and
administration
the
earliest
signs
were
mostly
pictorial
but
soon
they
stood
as
symbols
for
objects
ideas
and
sounds
this
writing
system
was
extremely
successful
and
outlasted
the
sumerian
empire
it
was
then
used
by
other
civilisations
in
the
middle
east
such
as
the
old
akkadian
babylonian
assyrian
elamite
hittite
old
persian
and
ugaritic
empires
the
last
cuneiform
inscription
was
dated
as
ad
thus
the
system
had
lasted
for
more
than
years
p
each
version
of
cuneiform
had
to
be
deciphered
separately
because
all
the
languages
were
different
documents
including
stone
objects
written
in
more
than
one
language
provided
the
clues
this
is
the
most
famous
of
the
old
forms
of
writing
or
scripts
it
was
invented
at
roughly
the
same
time
as
cuneiform
yet
was
quite
different
in
style
and
used
different
materials
egyptians
ended
up
with
three
writing
systems
for
the
same
language
they
were:
hieroglyphic:
the
famous
pictorial
language
on
stone
monuments
hieratic:
a
cursive
'running'
script
used
by
the
priests
demotic:
a
cursive
script
used
by
the
people
the
writing
tools
used
varied
according
to
the
material
which
was
written
on
the
two
cursive
scripts
were
written
with
reed
pens
and
carbon
inks
onto
papyrus
if
the
material
was
cloth
then
the
writing
was
done
by
a
brush
many
examples
survive
the
hieroglyphs
were
inscribed
carved
into
stone
hammer
chisel
or
painted
onto
stone
surfaces
many
survive
some
with
the
original
colours
intact
the
key
event
in
the
decipherment
of
hieroglyphic
writing
was
the
discovery
of
the
rosetta
stone
this
is
a
granite
slab
with
the
same
message
written
in
hieroglyphic
demotic
and
in
greek
ancient
greek
is
well
understood
and
made
possible
the
interpretation
of
the
other
two
scripts
chinese
is
the
language
with
the
largest
number
of
native
speakers
its
history
dates
back
to
about
bc
p
the
chinese
writing
system
is
idio-syllabic
a
mixed
method
using
characters
which
may
have
one
or
more
of
these
elements:
pictographic:
representing
objects
visual
logic:
the
number
''
is
three
horizontal
strokes
complex
logic:
the
sun
is
a
box
with
a
horizontal
mid-stroke
rebus:
sounds
like
the
character
for
wheat
is
also
used
for
'come'
because
the
words
are
homophonous
sound
alike
semantic-phonetic:
combination
of
a
character
for
meaning
with
another
for
sound
pronunciation
chinese
has
a
huge
number
of
characters:
in
the
region
of
p
because
of
this
printing
methods
were
never
really
successful
in
china
despite
their
early
invention
in
the
th
century
wang
tzhen
had
sixty
thousand
wood
block
characters
cut
a
huge
investment
in
time
and
money
he
printed
copies
of
a
local
gazette
and
was
author
of
a
treatise
on
agriculture
and
other
technical
works
even
with
printing
machines
from
europe
in
the
th
century
the
process
was
hampered
by
the
huge
number
of
characters
which
slowed
the
composition
to
a
snail's
pace
china
has
eight
regional
languages
that
are
mutually
unintelligible
and
many
true
dialects
the
system
appears
to
work
mainly
because
as
many
as
speak
mandarin
fluency
in
chinese
reading
and
writing
is
undoubtedly
difficult
to
achieve
and
this
must
act
as
a
brake
on
the
drive
for
literacy
there
have
been
a
number
of
attempts
to
reform
or
simplify
the
system
the
most
radical
in
pinyin
which
is
a
program
to
replace
chinese
characters
with
an
alphabetic
system
this
was
supported
by
mao
but
faltered
after
his
death
it
seems
that
the
idea
of
an
alphabet–a
script
based
entirely
upon
sound–arose
only
once
and
has
been
copied
and
adapted
to
suit
many
different
languages
although
no
alphabet
fits
its
language
perfectly
it
is
flexible
enough
to
fit
any
language
approximately
it
was
a
unique
invention
pour
alphabet
is
called
the
roman
alphabet
as
compared
with
the
cyrillic
and
other
alphabets
all
of
these
come
from
the
ancient
greek
alphabet
which
dates
back
to
about
to
bc
p
the
greek
alphabet
was
probably
developed
from
the
phoenician
script
which
appeared
somewhat
earlier
and
had
some
similar
letter-shapes
the
phoenician
language
was
a
semitic
language
often
called
canaanite
the
semitic
group
of
languages
includes
arabic
maltese
hebrew
and
also
aramaic
the
language
spoken
by
jesus
we
do
not
know
much
about
how
the
alphabetic
idea
arose
but
the
phoenicians
a
trading
people
came
up
with
letters
which
were
adapted
by
the
early
greeks
to
produce
their
alphabet
the
one
big
difference
is
that
the
phoenician
script
had
no
pure
vowels
arabic
script
has
vowels
which
may
be
shown
by
diacritics
small
marks
above
or
below
the
line
the
oldest
qu'ran
manuscripts
had
no
diacritics
israeli
children
today
use
texts
with
vowel
'dots'
added
to
about
the
third
grade
pno
ancient
script
alphabetic
or
not
had
pure
vowels
before
the
greeks
the
greek
alphabet
even
has
two
vowels
for
'e'
and
two
for
'o'
to
distinguish
between
the
long
and
short
sounds
it
is
fairly
clear
from
this
that
careful
thought
went
into
both
the
phoenician
invention
and
the
greek
adaptation
however
no
details
survive
of
either
process
semitic
scripts
apparently
derive
from
proto-sinaitic
a
script
of
which
only
inscriptions
plus
doubtful
are
known
it
is
thought
by
some
researchers
that
the
original
source
of
this
script
was
the
egyptian
hieratic
script
by
the
late
middle
kingdom
about
bc
hieratic
had
added
some
alphabetic
signs
for
representing
the
consonants
of
foreign
names
egyptian
activity
in
sinai
was
at
its
height
at
that
time
a
similar
idea
had
been
suggested
many
years
before
there
are
a
number
of
scripts
which
have
never
been
deciphered
despite
much
effort
p
perhaps
the
most
famous
are
the
script
of
the
indus
valley
civilization
and
etruscan
the
indus
river
civilisation
predates
other
literate
civilisations
on
the
indian
subcontinent
going
back
to
about
bc
their
cities
of
mohenjo-daru
and
harappa
were
well-planned
with
good
drainage
the
script
is
found
on
seal
stones
terracotta
bronze
bone
and
ivory
all
are
brief
and
the
language
is
unknown
the
etruscan
language
used
greek
letter-forms
and
is
found
mainly
on
etruscan
tombs
from
tuscany
through
to
venice
they
were
an
empire
before
the
romans
who
defeated
them
and
absorbed
their
ideas
all
knowledge
of
their
language
was
lost
except
that
some
of
the
names
on
tomb
memorials
can
be
read
from
the
greek
letters
the
tărtăria
tablets
are
three
tablets
discovered
in
in
the
village
of
tărtăria
hungarian:
alsótatárlaka
this
is
about
km
mi
from
alba
iulia
in
romania
the
tablets
dated
to
around
bc
have
symbols
in
clay:
the
vinča
symbols
some
claim
they
are
a
yet
undeciphered
language
if
this
is
so
they
would
be
the
earliest
known
form
of
writing
in
similar
symbols
were
found
during
excavations
by
miloje
vasić
–
in
vinča
this
is
a
suburb
of
belgrade
serbia
some
km
from
turdaș
later
more
were
found
in
another
part
of
belgrade
since
over
one
hundred
and
fifty
vinča
sites
have
been
found
in
serbia
alone
many
including
vinča
itself
have
not
been
fully
excavated
the
culture
of
the
whole
area
is
called
the
vinča
culture
although
some
of
these
symbols
look
exactly
the
same
as
some
letters
in
etruscan
greek
and
aramaic
they
are
generally
regarded
as
an
original
independent
development
it
is
only
in
the
last
years
that
most
people
have
been
able
to
read
and
write
in
europe
and
north
america
in
many
other
parts
of
the
world
this
did
not
happen
until
the
th
century
until
then
literacy
was
mainly
for
clerics
that
is
people
who
had
training
as
priests
even
wealthy
people
were
often
illiterate
and
used
scribes
to
write
for
them
the
invention
of
printing
came
before
mass
literacy
before
each
book
had
to
be
created
by
hand
so
there
were
few
books
available
compared
to
the
billions
in
the
world
today
mass
literacy
needed
cheap
books
even
now
there
is
still
widespread
illiteracy
the
ordinary
use
of
writing
by
means
of
a
pen
and
paper
can
refer
to
writing
for
oneself
as
in
a
diary
but
mostly
it
refers
to
sending
letters
once
it
was
almost
the
only
means

early
astronomers
used
only
their
eyes
to
look
at
the
stars
they
made
maps
of
the
constellations
and
stars
for
religious
reasons
and
calendars
to
work
out
the
time
of
year
early
civilisations
such
as
the
maya
people
and
the
ancient
egyptians
built
simple
observatories
and
drew
maps
of
the
stars
positions
they
also
began
to
think
about
the
place
of
earth
in
the
universe
for
a
long
time
people
thought
earth
was
the
center
of
the
universe
and
that
the
planets
the
stars
and
the
sun
went
around
it
this
is
known
as
geocentrism
ancient
greeks
tried
to
explain
the
motions
of
the
sun
and
stars
by
taking
measurements
a
mathematician
named
eratosthenes
was
the
first
who
measured
the
size
of
the
earth
and
proved
that
the
earth
is
a
sphere
a
theory
by
another
mathematician
named
aristarchus
was
that
the
sun
is
in
the
center
and
the
earth
is
moving
around
it
this
is
known
as
heliocentrism
only
a
few
people
thought
it
was
right
the
rest
continued
to
believe
in
the
geocentric
model
most
of
the
names
of
constellations
and
stars
come
from
greeks
of
that
time
arabic
astronomers
made
many
advancements
during
the
middle
ages
including
improved
star
maps
and
ways
to
estimate
the
size
of
the
earth
they
also
learned
from
the
ancients
by
translating
greek
books
into
arabic
during
the
renaissance
a
priest
named
nicolaus
copernicus
thought
from
looking
at
the
way
the
planets
moved
that
the
earth
was
not
the
center
of
everything
based
on
previous
works
he
said
that
the
earth
was
a
planet
and
all
the
planets
moved
around
the
sun
this
brought
back
the
old
idea
of
heliocentrism
a
physicist
called
galileo
galilei
built
his
own
telescopes
and
used
them
to
look
more
closely
at
the
stars
and
planets
for
the
first
time
he
agreed
with
copernicus
the
catholic
church
decided
that
galileo
was
wrong
he
had
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
under
house
arrest
heliocentric
ideas
were
soon
improved
by
johannes
kepler
and
isaac
newton
who
invented
the
theory
of
gravity
after
galileo
people
made
better
telescopes
and
used
them
to
see
farther
objects
such
as
the
planets
uranus
and
neptune
they
also
saw
how
stars
were
similar
to
our
sun
but
in
a
range
of
colours
and
sizes
they
also
saw
thousands
of
other
faraway
objects
such
as
galaxies
and
nebulae
the
th
century
saw
important
changes
in
astronomy
in
karl
jansky
discovered
radio
emission
from
outside
the
earth
when
trying
to
isolate
a
source
of
noise
in
radio
communications
marking
the
birth
of
radio
astronomy
and
the
first
attempts
at
using
another
part
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
to
observe
the
sky
those
parts
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
that
the
atmosphere
did
not
block
were
now
opened
up
to
astronomy
allowing
more
discoveries
to
be
made
the
opening
of
this
new
window
on
the
universe
saw
the
discovery
of
entirely
new
things
for
example
pulsars
which
sent
regular
pulses
of
radio
waves
out
into
space
the
waves
were
first
thought
to
be
alien
in
origin
because
the
pulses
were
so
regular
that
it
implied
an
artificial
source
the
period
after
world
war
saw
more
observatories
where
large
and
accurate
telescopes
are
built
and
operated
at
good
observing
sites
normally
by
governments
for
example
bernard
lovell
began
radio
astronomy
at
jodrell
bank
using
leftover
military
radar
equipment
by
the
site
had
the
largest
steerable
radio
telescope
in
the
world
similarly
the
end
of
the
saw
the
start
of
the
building
of
dedicated
observatories
at
mauna
kea
in
hawaii
a
good
site
for
visible
and
infra-red
telescopes
thanks
to
its
high
altitude
and
clear
skies
the
next
great
revolution
in
astronomy
was
thanks
to
the
birth
of
rocketry
this
allowed
telescopes
to
be
placed
in
space
on
satellites
space
telescopes
gave
access
for
the
first
time
in
history
to
the
entire
electromagnetic
spectrum
including
rays
that
had
been
blocked
by
the
atmosphere
the
x-rays
gamma
rays
ultraviolet
light
and
parts
of
the
infra-red
spectrum
were
all
opened
to
astronomy
as
observing
telescopes
were
launched
as
with
other
parts
of
the
spectrum
new
discoveries
were
made
from
satellites
were
launched
to
be
replaced
with
more
accurate
and
better
satellites
causing
the
sky
to
be
mapped
in
nearly
all
parts
of
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
discoveries
broadly
come
in
two
types:
bodies
and
phenomena
bodies
are
things
in
the
universe
whether
it
is
a
planet
like
our
earth
or
a
galaxy
like
our
milky
way
phenomena
are
events
and
happenings
in
the
universe
for
convenience
this
section
has
been
divided
by
where
these
astronomical
bodies
may
be
found:
those
found
around
stars
are
solar
bodies
those
inside
galaxies
are
galactic
bodies
and
everything
else
larger
are
cosmic
bodies
planets
asteroids
comets
starsdiffuse
objects:
nebulas
clusterscompact
stars:
white
dwarves
neutron
stars
black
holes
galaxies
galaxy
clusters
superclusters
burst
events
are
those
where
there
is
a
sudden
change
in
the
heavens
that
disappears
quickly
these
are
called
bursts
because
they
are
normally
associated
with
large
explosions
producing
a
burst
of
energy
they
include:
supernovas
novasperiodic
events
are
those
that
happen
regularly
in
a
repetitive
way
the
name
periodic
comes
from
period
which
is
the
length
of
time
required
for
a
wave
to
complete
one
cycle
periodic
phenomena
include:
pulsars
variable
starsnoise
phenomena
tend
to
relate
to
things
that
happened
a
long
time
ago
the
signal
from
these
events
bounce
around
the
universe
until
it
seems
to
come
from
everywhere
and
varies
little
in
intensity
in
this
way
it
resembles
noise
the
background
signal
that
pervades
every
instrument
used
for
astronomy
the
most
common
example
of
noise
is
static
seen
on
analogue
televisions
the
principal
astronomical
example
is:
cosmic
background
radiation
telescopes
are
the
main
tool
of
observing
they
take
all
the
light
in
a
big
area
and
put
in
into
a
small
area
this
is
like
making
your
eyes
very
big
and
powerful
astronomers
use
telescopes
to
look
at
things
that
are
far
away
and
dim
telescopes
make
objects
look
bigger
closer
brighter
spectrometers
study
the
different
wavelengths
of
light
this
shows
what
something
is
made
of
many
telescopes
are
in
satellites
they
are
space
observatories
there
are
way
astronomers
can
get
better
pictures
of
the
heavens
light
from
a
distant
source
reaches
a
sensor
and
gets
measured
normally
by
a
human
eye
or
a
camera
for
very
dim
sources
there
may
not
be
enough
light
particles
coming
from
the
source
for
it
to
be
seen
one
technique
that
astronomers
have
for
making
it
visible
is
using
integration
which
is
like
longer
exposures
in
photography
astronomical
sources
do
not
move
much:
only
the
rotation
and
movement
of
the
earth
causes
them
to
move
across
the
heavens
as
light
particles
reach
the
camera
over
time
they
hit
the
same
place
making
it
brighter
and
more
visible
than
the
background
until
it
can
be
seen
telescopes
at
most
observatories
and
satellite
instruments
can
normally
track
a
source
as
it
moves
across
the
heavens
making
the
star
appear
still
to
the
telescope
and
allowing
longer
exposures
also
images
can
be
taken
on
different
nights
so
exposures
span
hours
days
or
even
months
in
the
digital
era
digitised
pictures
of
the
sky
can
be
added
together
by
computer
which
overlays
the
images
after
correcting
for
movement
with
radio
telescopes
smaller
telescopes
can
be
combined
together
to
create
a
big
one
which
works
like
one
as
big
as
the
distance
between
the
two
smaller

better
data
analysis
is
the
process
of
getting
more
information
out
of
an
astronomical
observation
than
by
simply
looking
at
it
the
observation
is
first
stored
as
data
this
data
will
then
have
various
techniques
used
to
analyse
it
fourier
analysis
in
mathematics
can
show
if
an
observation
over
a
length
of
time
is
changing
periodically
changes
like
a
wave
if
so
it
can
extract
the
frequencies
and
the
type
of

pattern
and
find
many
things
including
new

not
all
of
a
type
of
bright

it
turned
out
that
all

of
the
important

and
the

used
to
describe
them
it
should
be
noted
that
astronomy
in
the
modern

has
been
divided
mainly
by
electromagnetic
spectrum
although
there
is
some
evidence
this
is
changing
solar
astronomy
is
the
study
of
the
sun
the
sun
is
the
closest
star
to
earth
at
around
million
miles
away
it
is
the
easiest
to
observe
in
detail
observing
the
sun
can
help
us
understand
how
other
stars
work
and
are
formed
changes
in
the
sun
can
affect
the
weather
and
climate
on
earth
a
stream
of
charged
particles
called
the
solar
wind
is
constantly
sent
off
from
the
sun
the
solar
wind
hitting
the
earth's
magnetic
field
causes
the
northern
lights
studying
the
sun
helped
people
understand
how
nuclear
fusion
works
planetary
astronomy
is
the
study
of
planets
moons
dwarf
planets
comets
and
asteroids
as
well
as
other
small
objects
that
orbit
stars
the
planets
of
our
own
solar
system
have
been
studied
in
depth
by
many
visiting
spacecraft
such
as
cassini-huygens
saturn
and
the
voyager
and
galactic
astronomy
is
the
study
of
distant
galaxies
studying
distant
galaxies
is
the
best
way
of
learning
about
our
own
galaxy
as
the
gases
and
stars
in
our
own
galaxy
make
it
difficult
to
observe
galactic
astronomers
attempt
to
understand
the
structure
of
galaxies
and
how
they
are
formed
through
the
use
of
different
types
of
telescopes
and
computer
simulations
radio
telescope
hydrodynamics
is
used
in
astronomy
for
mathematically
modelling
how
gases
behave
strong
magnetic
fields
found
around
many
bodies
can
drastically
change
how
these
gases
behave
affecting
things
from
star
formation
to
the
flows
of
gases
around
compact
stars
this
makes
mhd
an
important
and
useful
tool
in
astronomy
gravitational
wave
astronomy
is
the
study
of
the
universe
in
the
gravitational
wave
spectrum
so
far
all
astronomy
that
has
been
done
has
used
the
electromagnetic
spectrum
gravitational
waves
are
ripples
in
spacetime
emitted
by
very
dense
objects
changing
shape
which
include
white
dwarves
neutron
stars
and
black
holes
because
no
one
has
been
able
to
detect
gravitational
waves
directly
the
impact
of
gravitational
wave
astronomy
has
been
very
limited
a

solar
astronomy
====
there
are
galaxies
of
different
sizes
typical
galaxies
range
from
dwarfs
with
as
few
as
ten
million
stars
up
to
giants
with
a
hundred
trillion
stars
all
orbiting
the
galaxy's
center
of
mass
galaxies
may
contain
many
multiple
star
systems
star
clusters
and
various
interstellar
clouds
the
sun
is
one
of
the
stars
in
the
milky

galaxy
the
solar
system
includes
the
earth
and
all
the
other
objects
that
orbit
the
sun
star
clusters
are
not
galaxies
they
are
inside
galaxies
globular
clusters
are
spherical-shape
star
cluster
which
are
part
of
the
outer
halo
of
the
milky
way
one
of
the
largest
and
oldest
known
star
clusters
messier
has
several
million
stars
packed
closely
together
with
a
black
hole
at
its
centre
the
stars
are
too
closely
packed
to
get
an
accurate
count
but
it
certainly
has
more
stars
than
some
of
the
smaller
galaxies
within
galaxy
clusters
galaxies
move
relative
to
other
galaxies
they
can
and
do
collide
when
this
happens
the
stars
generally
move
past
each
other
but
gas
clouds
and
dust
interact
and
can
form
a
burst
of
new
stars
gravity
pulls
both
galaxies
into
somewhat
new
shapes
forming
bars
rings
or
tail-like
structures
many
galaxies
also
continue
to
form
new
generations
of
stars
the
milky
way
and
all
spiral
shaped
galaxies
like
it
see
right
side
image
of
ngc
produce
new
stars
at
a
rate
of
one
or
two
stars
per
year
this
star
formation
happens
in
the
vast
interstellar
clouds
that
account
for
about
to
of
the
mass
of
these
galaxies
globular
star
clusters
on
the
other
hand
are
not
currently
forming
stars
because
this
activity
happened
billions
of
years
ago
and
then
stopped
once
all
of
the
gas
and
dust
clouds
were
used
up
in
the
astronomical
literature
the
word
'galaxy'
with
a
capital
g
is
used
for
our
galaxy
the
milky
way
the
billions
of
other
galaxies
are
just
written
as
'galaxy'
with
a
lowercase
g
the
term
milky
way
first
came
out
in
the
english
language
in
a
poem
by
chaucer
see
yonder
lo
the
galaxyë
which
men
clepeth
the
milky
wey
for
hit
is
whyt
when
william
herschel
wrote
his
catalogue
of
deep
sky
objects
he
used
the
name
spiral
nebula
for
objects
like
the
andromeda
galaxy
years
later
astronomers
discovered
that
they
are
made
of
stars
as
the
milky
way
is
so
nebula
is
now
only
used
for
diffuse
structures
within
a
galaxy
there
are
two
main
kinds
of
galaxies
spiral
galaxy
and
elliptical
galaxy
they
are
classified
according
to
the
hubble
sequence
a
spiral
galaxy
is
a
galaxy
that
has
a
spiral
shape
most
of
the
galaxies
in
the
universe
observed
by
astronomers
are
spiral
galaxies
about
they
are
divided
into
two
:
barred
spiral
galaxy
classified
as
sb
unbarred
spiral
galaxy
classified
as
sangc
and
ngc
are
examples
of
barred
spiral
galaxy
whirlpool
galaxy
and
messier
are
examples
of
unbarred
spiral
galaxy
the
identifying
characteristics
of
a
spiral
galaxy
are
disk-shaped
rotating
spiral
arms
and
a
bulge
in
the
galactic
core
the
spiral
arms
are
where
new
hot
stars
are
born
bulge
in
the
galactic
core
has
old
stars
this
feature
is
common
to
the
most
spiral
galaxies
an
elliptical
galaxy
is
a
galaxy
that
has
a
ellipsoid
d
of
ellipse
shape
this
type
of
galaxy
are
dominant
in
universe
especially
in
galaxy
clusters
the
shape
range
from
circle
ellipse
and
cigar-shaped
in
hubble
sequence
this
shape
can
be
represented
as
class
:
e
circle-shape
e
ellipse-shape
e
cigar-shapedelliptical
galaxy
can
have
a
large
range
size
the
giant
elliptical
galaxy
can
be
over
a
more
million
light
year
and
the
smallest
know
as
dwarf
elliptical
galaxy
are
less
than
one-tenth
the
size
of
milky
way
the
size
of
an
elliptical
galaxy
can
be
measured
as
an
effective
radius
which
defines
the
area
from
which
half
its
light
comes
the
mass
of
elliptical
galaxy
is
also
large
a
giant
elliptical
galaxy
can
have
mass
of
many
trillions
of
solar
masses
the
simple
definition
of
lenticular
galaxy
is
a
galaxy
seen
in
a
disc
shape
determining
the
shape
of
a
lenticular
galaxy
is
difficult
because
the
shape
can
be
between
spiral
galaxy
and
elliptical
galaxy
the
shape
can
be
known
by
looking
at
the
bulge
of
the
galactic
center
if
the
bulge
is
very
bright
it
is

the

being
round
half
of
it
is

up
by
the

as
it
goes
around
or
orbits
the
earth
sometimes
the
side
that
people
on
earth
can
see
is
all
lit
brightly
other
times
only
a
small
part
of
the
side
we
see
is
lit
this
is
because
the
moon
does
not
send
out
its
own
light
people
only
see
the
parts
that
are
being
lit
by
sunlight
these
different
stages
are
called
phases
of
the

it
takes
the
moon
about
days
days
hours
minutes
to
complete
the
cycle
from
big
and
bright
to
small
and
dim
and
back
to
big

the
phase
when
the
moon
passes
between
the

and

is
called
the
new

the
next
phase
of
the

is
called
the
waxing
crescent
followed
by
the
first
quarter
waxing
gibbous
then
to
a
full

a
full
moon
occurs
when
the
moon
and
sun
are
on
opposite
sides
of
the
earth
as
the
moon
continues
its
orbit
it
becomes
a
waning

waning
crescent
and
finally

people
used
the

to

a

is
approximately
equal

to
a
lunar

the
moon
always
shows
the

side
to
earth
astronomers
call
this
phenomenon
tidal
locking
this
means
that
half
of
it
can
never
be
seen
from
earth
the
side
facing
away
from
earth
is
called
the
far
side
or
dark
side
of
the
moon
even
though
the
sun
does
shine
on
it—we
just
never
see
it
lit
before
people
stood
on
the

the
united

and
the
ussr
sent

to
the

these

would
orbit
the

the

were
the

armstrong
climbed
down

was
the
first
human
to

as
he
said
that's
one
small

for
a
man
one
giant
leap
for
mankind
even
though
their
footprints
were
left
on
the
moon
a
long
time
ago
it
is
likely
that
they
are
still
there
as
there
is
no
wind
or
rain
making
erosion
extremely
slow
the

do
not

more
people
landed

between
and
when
the
last
spaceship
apollo
visited
eugene
cernan
of
apollo
was
the
last
person
to
touch
the
moon
because
it
is
smaller
the
moon
has
less
gravity
than
earth
only
/
of
the
amount
on
earth
so
if
a
person
weighs
kg
on
earth
the
person
would
only
weigh
kg
on
the
moon
but
even
though
the
moon's
gravity
is
weaker
than
the
earth's
gravity
it
is
still
there
if
person
dropped
a
ball
while
standing
on
the
moon
it
would
still
fall
down
however
it
would
fall
much
more
slowly
a
person
who
jumped
as
high
as
possible
on
the
moon
would
jump
higher
than
on
earth
but
still
fall
back
to
the
ground
because
the
moon
has
no
atmosphere
there
is
no
air
resistance
so
a
feather
will
fall
as
fast
as
a
hammer
without
an
atmosphere
the
environment
is
not
protected
from
heat
or
cold
astronauts
wore
spacesuits
and
carried
oxygen
to
breathe
the
suit
weighed
about
as
much
as
the
astronaut
the
moon's
gravity
is
weak
so
it
was
not
as
heavy
as
on
earth
in
the
earth
the
sky
is
blue
because
the
blue
rays
of
the
sun
bounce
off
the
gases
in
the
atmosphere
making
it
look
like
blue
light
is
coming
from
the
sky
but
on
the
moon
because
there
is
no
atmosphere
the
sky
looks
black
even
in
the
daytime
and
because
there
is
no
atmosphere
to
protect
the
moon
from
the
rocks
that
fall
from
outer
space
these
meteorites
crash
right
into
the
moon
and
make
wide
shallow
holes
called
craters
the
moon
has
thousands
of
them
newer
craters
gradually
wear
away
the
older
ones
the
giant
impact
hypothesis
is
that
the
moon
was
created
out
of
the
debris
from
a
collision
between
the
young
earth
and
a
mars-sized
protoplanet
this
is
the
favored
scientific
hypothesis
for
the
formation
of
the
moon
in
nasa
said
that
they
had
found
a
lot
of
water
on
the
moon
the
water
is
not
liquid
but
is
in
the
form
of
hydrates
and
hydroxides
liquid
water
cannot
exist
on
the
moon
because
photodissociation
quickly
breaks
down
the
molecules
however
from
the
image
nasa
received
there
is
a
history
of
water
existence
during
the
cold
war
the
united
states
army
thought
about
making
a
military
post
on
the
moon
able
to
attack
targets
on
earth
they
also
considered
conducting
a
nuclear
weapon
test
on
the
moon
the
united
states
air
force
had
similar
plans
however
both
plans
were
brushed-off
as
nasa
moved
from
a
military
to
a
civilian-based
agency
even
though
the
soviet
union
left
remains
on
the
moon
and
the
united
states
left
a
few
flags
no
country
has
control
over
the
moon
the
and
soviet
union
both
signed
the
outer
space
treaty
which
calls
the
moon
and
all
of
outer
space
the
province
of
all
mankind
this
treaty
also
banned
all
use
of
the
military
of
the

the

dna
has
a
double
helix
shape
which
is
like
a
ladder
twisted
into
a
spiral
each
step
of
the
ladder
is
a
pair
of
nucleotides
a
nucleotide
is
a
molecule
made
up
of:
deoxyribose
a
kind
of
sugar
with
carbon
atoms
a
phosphate
group
made
of
phosphorus
and
oxygen
and
nitrogenous
basedna
is
made
of
four
types
of
nucleotide:
adenine
a
thymine
t
cytosine
c
guanine
gthe
'rungs'
of
the
dna
ladder
are
each
made
of
two
bases
one
base
coming
from
each
leg
the
bases
connect
in
the
middle:
'a'
only
pairs
with
't'
and
'c'
only
pairs
with
'g'
the
bases
are
held
together
by
hydrogen
bonds
adenine
a
and
thymine
t
can
pair
up
because
they
make
two
hydrogen
bonds
and
cytosine
c
and
guanine
g
pair
up
to
make
three
hydrogen
bonds
although
the
bases
are
always
in
fixed
pairs
the
pairs
can
come
in
any
order
a-t
or
t-a
similarly
c-g
or
g-c
this
way
dna
can
write
'codes'
out
of
the
'letters'
that
are
the
bases
these
codes
contain
the
message
that
tells
the
cell
what
to
do
on
chromosomes
the
dna
is
bound
up
with
proteins
called
histones
to
form
chromatin
this
association
takes
part
in
epigenetics
and
gene
regulation
genes
are
switched
on
and
off
during
development
and
cell
activity
and
this
regulation
is
the
basis
of
most
of
the
activity
which
takes
place
in
cells
when
dna
is
copied
this
is
called
dna
replication
briefly
the
hydrogen
bonds
holding
together
paired
bases
are
broken
and
the
molecule
is
split
in
half:
the
legs
of
the
ladder
are
separated
this
gives
two
single
strands
new
strands
are
formed
by
matching
the
bases
a
with
t
and
g
with
c
to
make
the
missing
strands
first
an
enzyme
called
dna
helicase
splits
the
dna
down
the
middle
by
breaking
the
hydrogen
bonds
then
after
the
dna
molecule
is
in
two
separate
pieces
another
molecule
called
dna
polymerase
makes
a
new
strand
that
matches
each
of
the
strands
of
the
split
dna
molecule
each
copy
of
a
dna
molecule
is
made
of
half
of
the
original
starting
molecule
and
half
of
new
bases
when
dna
is
copied
mistakes
are
sometimes
made
–
these
are
called
mutations
there
are
three
main
types
of
mutations:
deletion
where
one
or
more
bases
are
left
out
substitution
where
one
or
more
bases
are
substituted
for
another
base
in
the
sequence
insertion
where
one
or
more
extra
base
is
put
in
duplication
where
a
sequence
of
bases
pairs
are
repeated
mutations
may
also
be
classified
by
their
effect
on
the
structure
and
function
of
proteins
or
their
effect
on
fitness
mutations
may
be
bad
for
the
organism
or
neutral
or
of
benefit
sometimes
mutations
are
fatal
for
the
organism
–
the
protein
made
by
the
new
dna
does
not
work
at
all
and
this
causes
the
embryo
to
die
on
the
other
hand
evolution
is
moved
forward
by
mutations
when
the
new
version
of
the
protein
works
better
for
the
organism
a
section
of
dna
that
contains
instructions
to
make
a
protein
is
called
a
gene
each
gene
has
the
sequence
for
at
least
one
polypeptide
proteins
form
structures
and
also
form
enzymes
the
enzymes
do
most
of
the
work
in
cells
proteins
are
made
out
of
smaller
polypeptides
which
are
formed
of
amino
acids
to
make
a
protein
to
do
a
particular
job
the
correct
amino
acids
have
to
be
joined
up
in
the
correct
order
proteins
are
made
by
tiny
machines
in
the
cell
called
ribosomes
ribosomes
are
in
the
main
body
of
the
cell
but
dna
is
only
in
the
nucleus
of
the
cell
the
codon
is
part
of
the
dna
but
dna
never
leaves
the
nucleus
because
dna
cannot
leave
the
nucleus
the
cell
makes
a
copy
of
the
dna
sequence
in
rna
this
is
smaller
and
can
get
through
the
holes
–
pores
–
in
the
membrane
of
the
nucleus
and
out
into
the
cell
genes
encoded
in
dna
are
transcribed
into
messenger
rna
mrna
by
proteins
such
as
rna
polymerase
mature
mrna
is
then
used
as
a
template
for
protein
synthesis
by
the
ribosome
ribosomes
read
codons
'words'
made
of
three
base
pairs
that
tell
the
ribosome
which
amino
acid
to
add
the
ribosome
scans
along
an
mrna
reading
the
code
while
it
makes
protein
another
rna
called
trna
helps
match
the
right
amino
acid
to
each
codon
dna
was
first
isolated
extracted
from
cells
by
swiss
physician
friedrich
miescher
in
when
he
was
working
on
bacteria
from
the
pus
in
surgical
bandages
the
molecule
was
found
in
the
nucleus
of
the
cells
and
so
he
called
it
nuclein
in
frederick
griffith
discovered
that
traits
of
the
smooth
form
of
pneumococcus
could
be
transferred
to
the
rough
form
of
the
same
bacteria
by
mixing
killed
smooth
bacteria
with
the
live
rough
form
this
system
provided
the
first
clear
suggestion
that
dna
carries
genetic
information
the
avery–macleod–mccarty
experiment
identified
dna
as
the
transforming
principle
in
dna's
role
in
heredity
was
confirmed
in
when
alfred
hershey
and
martha
chase
in
the
hershey–chase
experiment
showed
that
dna
is
the
genetic
material
of
the
t
bacteriophage
in
the
erwin
chargaff
found
that
the
amount
of
thymine
t
present
in
a
molecule
of
dna
was
about
equal
to
the
amount
of
adenine
a
present
he
found
that
the
same
applies
to
guanine
g
and
cytosine
c
chargaff's
rules
summarises
this
finding
in
james
d
watson
and
francis
crick
suggested
what
is
now
accepted
as
the
first
correct
double-helix
model
of
dna
structure
in
the
journal
nature
their
double-helix
molecular
model
of
dna
was
then
based
on
a
single
x-ray
diffraction
image
photo
taken
by
rosalind
franklin
and
raymond
gosling
in
may
experimental
evidence
supporting
the
watson
and
crick
model
was
published
in
a
series
of
five
articles
in
the
same
issue
of

of
these
franklin

gosling's
paper
was
the
first
publication
of

own

method
that
partly
supported
the
watson

by
maurice
wilkins
and
two
of
his
colleagues
whose

and

also
supported
the

in

proposed
by

for
their
double-helix

jointly
received
the

at
the
time
a
debate
continues
about
who
should
receive
credit
for
the
discovery
in
crick
explained
the
relationship
between
dna
rna
and
proteins
in
the
central

of
molecular
biology
how
dna
was
copied
the
replication
mechanism
came
in
through
the
meselson–stahl
experiment
more
work
by
crick
and
coworkers
showed
that
the
genetic
code
was
based
on
non-overlapping
triplets
of
bases
called
codons
these
findings
represent
the
birth
of

the
evidence
for
evolution
is
given
in
a
number
of
books
some
of
this
evidence
is
discussed
here
the
realization
that
some
rocks
contain
fossils
was
a
very
important
event
in
natural
history
there
are
three
parts
to
this
story:
realizing
that
things
in
rocks
which
looked
organic
actually
were
the
altered
remains
of
living
things
this
was
settled
in
the
th
and
th
centuries
by
conrad
gessner
nicolaus
steno
robert
hooke
and
others
realizing
that
many
fossils
represented
species
which
do
not
exist
today
it
was
georges
cuvier
the
comparative
anatomist
who
proved
that
extinction
occurred
and
that
different
strata
contained
different
fossils
p
realizing
that
early
fossils
were
simpler
organisms
than
later
fossils
also
the
later
the
rocks
the
more
like
the
present
day
are
the
fossils
the
most
convincing
evidence
for
the
occurrence
of
evolution
is
the
discovery
of
extinct
organisms
in
older
geological
strata
the
older
the
strata
are
the
more
different
the
fossil
will
be
from
living
representatives
that
is
to
be
expected
if
the
fauna
and
flora
of
the
earlier
strata
had
gradually
evolved
into
their
descendants
the
evolution
of
the
horse
family
equidae
is
a
good
example
of
the
way
that
evolution
works
the
oldest
fossil
of
a
horse
is
about
million
years
old
it
was
a
small
animal
with
five
toes
on
the
front
feet
and
four
on
the
hind
feet
at
that
time
there
were
more
forests
in
the
world
than
today
this
horse
lived
in
woodland
eating
leaves
nuts
and
fruit
with
its
simple
teeth
it
was
only
about
as
big
as
a
fox
about
million
years
ago
the
world
started
to
become
cooler
and
drier
forests
shrank
grassland
expanded
and
horses
changed
they
ate
grass
they
grew
larger
and
they
ran
faster
because
they
had
to
escape
faster
predators
because
grass
wears
teeth
out
horses
with
longer-lasting
teeth
had
an
advantage
for
most
of
this
long
period
of
time
there
were
a
number
of
horse
types
genera
now
however
only
one
genus
exists:
the
modern
horse
equus
it
has
teeth
which
grow
all
its
life
hooves
on
single
toes
great
long
legs
for
running
and
the
animal
is
big
and
strong
enough
to
survive
in
the
open
plain
horses
lived
in
western
canada
until
years
ago
but
all
horses
in
north
america
became
extinct
about
years
ago
the
causes
of
this
extinction
are
not
yet
clear
climate
change
and
over-hunting
by
humans
are
suggested
so
scientists
can
see
that
changes
have
happened
they
have
happened
slowly
over
a
long
time
how
these
changes
have
come
about
is
explained
by
the
theory
of
evolution
this
is
a
topic
which
fascinated
both
charles
darwin
and
alfred
russel
wallace
when
new
species
occur
usually
by
the
splitting
of
older
species
this
takes
place
in
one
place
in
the
world
once
it
is
established
a
new
species
may
spread
to
some
places
and
not
others
australasia
has
been
separated
from
other
continents
for
many
millions
of
years
in
the
main
part
of
the
continent
australia
of
mammals
of
reptiles
of
fish
and
insects
and
of
amphibians
are
endemic
its
native
mammals
are
mostly
marsupials
like
kangaroos
bandicoots
and
quolls
by
contrast
marsupials
are
today
totally
absent
from
africa
and
form
a
small
portion
of
the
mammalian
fauna
of
south
america
where
opossums
shrew
opossums
and
the
monito
del
monte
occur
see
the
great
american
interchange
the
only
living
representatives
of
primitive
egg-laying
mammals
monotremes
are
the
echidnas
and
the
platypus
they
are
only
found
in
australasia
which
includes
tasmania
new
guinea
and
kangaroo
island
these
monotremes
are
totally
absent
in
the
rest
of
the
world
on
the
other
hand
australia
is
missing
many
groups
of
placental
mammals
that
are
common
on
other
continents
carnivora
artiodactyls
shrews
squirrels
lagomorphs
although
it
does
have
indigenous
bats
and
rodents
which
arrived
later
the
evolutionary
story
is
that
placental
mammals
evolved
in
eurasia
and
wiped
out
the
marsupials
and
monotremes
wherever
they
spread
they
did
not
reach
australasia
until
more
recently
that
is
the
simple
reason
why
australia
has
most
of
the
world's
marsupials
and
all
the
world's
monotremes
in
about
sq
mi
km
the
hawaiian
islands
have
the
most
diverse
collection
of
drosophila
flies
in
the
world
living
from
rainforests
to
mountain
meadows
about
hawaiian
drosophilid
species
are
known
genetic
evidence
shows
that
all
the
native
drosophilid
species
in
hawaiʻi
have
descended
from
a
single
ancestral
species
that
colonized
the
islands
about
million
years
ago
the
subsequent
adaptive
radiation
was
spurred
by
a
lack
of
competition
and
a
wide
variety
of
vacant
niches
although
it
would
be
possible
for
a
single
pregnant
female
to
colonise
an
island
it
is
more
likely
to
have
been
a
group
from
the
same
species
the
combination
of
continental
drift
and
evolution
can
explain
what
is
found
in
the
fossil
record
glossopteris
is
an
extinct
species
of
seed
fern
plants
from
the
permian
period
on
the
ancient
supercontinent
of
gondwana
glossopteris
fossils
are
found
in
permian
strata
in
southeast
south
america
southeast
africa
all
of
madagascar
northern
india
all
of
australia
all
of
new
zealand
and
scattered
on
the
southern
and
northern
edges
of
antarctica
during
the
permian
these
continents
were
connected
as
gondwana
this
is
known
from
magnetic
striping
in
the
rocks
other
fossil
distributions
and
glacial
scratches
pointing
away
from
the
temperate
climate
of
the
south
pole
during
the
permian
p
when
biologists
look
at
living
things
they
see
that
animals
and
plants
belong
to
groups
which
have
something
in
common
charles
darwin
explained
that
this
followed
naturally
if
we
admit
the
common
parentage
of
allied
forms
together
with
their
modification
through
variation
and
natural
selection
ppfor
example
all
insects
are
related
they
share
a
basic
body
plan
whose
development
is
controlled
by
master
regulatory
genes
they
have
six
legs
they
have
hard
parts
on
the
outside
of
the
body
an
exoskeleton
they
have
eyes
formed
of
many
separate
chambers
and
so
on
biologists
explain
this
with
evolution
all
insects
are
the
descendants
of
a
group
of
animals
who
lived
a
long
time
ago
they
still
keep
the
basic
plan
six
legs
and
so
on
but
the
details
change
they
look
different
now
because
they
changed
in
different
ways:
this
is
evolution
it
was
darwin
who
first
suggested
that
all
life
on
earth
had
a
single
origin
and
from
that
beginning
endless
forms
most
beautiful
and
most
wonderful
have
been
and
are
being
evolved
p
evidence
from
molecular
biology
in
recent
years
has
supported
the
idea
that
all
life
is
related
by
common
descent
strong
evidence
for
common
descent
comes
from
vestigial
structures
p
the
useless
wings
of
flightless
beetles
are
sealed
under
fused
wing
covers
this
can
be
simply
explained
by
their
descent
from
ancestral
beetles
which
had
wings
that
worked
prudimentary
body
parts
those
that
are
smaller
and
simpler
in
structure
than
corresponding
parts
in
ancestral
species
are
called
vestigial
organs
those
organs
are
functional
in
the
ancestral
species
but
are
now
either
nonfunctional
or
re-adapted
to
a
new
function
examples
are
the
pelvic
girdles
of
whales
halteres
hind
wings
of
flies
wings
of
flightless
birds
and
the
leaves
of
some
xerophytes
e
g
cactus
and
parasitic
plants
e
g
dodder
however
vestigial
structures
may
have
their
original
function
replaced
with
another
for
example
the
halteres
in
flies
help
balance
the
insect
while
in
flight
and
the
wings
of
ostriches
are
used
in
mating
rituals
and
in
aggressive
display
the
ear
ossicles
in
mammals
are
former
bones
of
the
lower
jaw
rudimentary
organs
plainly
declare
their
origin
and
meaning
p
rudimentary
organs
are
the
record
of
a
former
state
of
things
and
have
been
retained
solely
though
the
powers
of
inheritance
far
from
being
a
difficulty
as
they
assuredly
do
on
the
old
doctrine
of
creation
might
even
have
been
anticipated
in
accordance
with
the
views
here
explained
p
charles
darwin
in
robert
wiedersheim
published
a
book
on
human
anatomy
and
its
relevance
to
man's
evolutionary
history
this
book
contained
a
list
of
human
organs
that
he
considered
vestigial
this
list
included
examples
such
as
the
appendix
and
the
rd
molar
teeth
wisdom
teeth
the
strong
grip
of
a
baby
is
another
example
it
is
a
vestigial
reflex
a
remnant
of
the
past
when
pre-human
babies
clung
to
their
mothers'
hair
as
the
mothers
swung
through
the
trees
this
is
borne
out
by
the
babies'
feet
which
curl
up
when
it
is
sitting
down
primate
babies
grip
with
the
feet
as
well
all
primates
except
modern
man
have
thick
body
hair
to
which
an
infant
can
cling
unlike
modern
humans
the
grasp
reflex
allows
the
mother
to
escape
danger
by
climbing
a
tree
using
both
hands
and
feet
vestigial
organs
often
have
some
selection
against
them
the
original
organs
took
resources
sometimes
huge
resources
if
they
no
longer
have
a
function
reducing
their
size
improves
fitness
and
there
is
direct
evidence
of
selection
some
cave
crustacea
reproduce
more
successfully
with
smaller
eyes
than
do
those
with
larger
eyes
this
may
be
because
the
nervous
tissue
dealing
with
sight
now
becomes
available
to
handle
other
sensory
input
p
from
the
eighteenth
century
it
was
known
that
embryos
of
different
species
were
much
more
similar
than
the
adults
in
particular
some
parts
of
embryos
reflect
their
evolutionary
past
for
example
the
embryos
of
land
vertebrates
develop
gill
slits
like
fish
embryos
of
course
this
is
only
a
temporary
stage
which
gives
rise
to
many
structures
in
the
neck
of
reptiles
birds
and
mammals
the
proto-gill
slits
are
part
of
a
complicated
system
of
development:
that
is
why
they
persisted
another
example
are
the
embryonic
teeth
of
baleen
whales
they
are
later
lost
the
baleen
filter
is
developed
from
different
tissue
called
keratin
early
fossil
baleen
whales
did
actually
have
teeth
as
well
as
the
baleen
a
good
example
is
the
barnacle
it
took
many
centuries
before
natural
historians
discovered
that
barnacles
were
crustacea
their
adults
look
so
unlike
other
crustacea
but
their
larvae
are
very
similar
to
those
of
other
crustacea
charles
darwin
lived
in
a
world
where
animal
husbandry
and
domesticated
crops
were
vitally
important
in
both
cases
farmers
selected
for
breeding
individuals
with
special
properties
and
prevented
the
breeding
of
individuals
with
less
desirable
characteristics
the
eighteenth
and
early
nineteenth
century
saw
a
growth
in
scientific
agriculture
and
artificial
breeding
was
part
of
this
darwin
discussed
artificial
selection
as
a
model
for
natural
selection
in
the
first
edition
of
his
work
on
the
origin
of
species
in
chapter
iv:
natural
selection:
slow
though
the
process
of
selection
may
be
if
feeble
man
can
do
much
by
his
powers
of
artificial
selection
i
can
see
no
limit
to
the
amount
of
change
which
may
be
effected
in
the
long
course
of
time
by
nature's
power
of
selection
p
nikolai
vavilov
showed
that
rye
originally
a
weed
came
to
be
a
crop
plant
by
unintentional
selection
rye
is
a
tougher
plant
than
wheat:
it
survives
in
harsher
conditions
having
become
a
crop
like
the
wheat
rye
was
able
to
become
a
crop
plant
in
harsh
areas
such
as
hills
and
mountains
there
is
no
real
difference
in
the
genetic
processes
underlying
artificial
and
natural
selection
and
the
concept
of
artificial
selection
was
used
by
charles
darwin
as
an
illustration
of
the
wider
process
of
natural
selection
there
are
practical
differences
experimental
studies
of
artificial
selection
show
that
the
rate
of
evolution
in
selection
experiments
is
at
least
two
orders
of
magnitude
that
is
times
greater
than
any
rate
seen
in
nature
or
the
fossil
record
p
some
have
thought
that
artificial
selection
could
not
produce
new
species
it
now
seems
that
it
can
new
species
have
been
created
by
domesticated
animal
husbandry
but
the
details
are
not
known
or
not
clear
for
example
domestic
sheep
were
created
by
hybridisation
and
no
longer
produce
viable
offspring
with
ovis
orientalis
one
species
from
which
they
are
descended
domestic
cattle
on
the
other
hand
can
be
considered
the
same
species
as
several
varieties
of
wild
ox
gaur
yak
etc
as
they
readily
produce
fertile
offspring
with
them
the
best-documented
new
species
came
from
laboratory
experiments
in
the
late
william
rice
and
g
w
salt
bred
fruit
flies
drosophila
melanogaster
using
a
maze
with
three
different
choices
of
habitat
such
as
light/dark
and
wet/dry
each
generation
was
put
into
the
maze
and
the
groups
of
flies
that
came
out
of
two
of
the
eight
exits
were
set
apart
to
breed
with
each
other
in
their
respective
groups
after
thirty-five
generations
the
two
groups
and
their
offspring
were
isolated
reproductively
because
of
their
strong
habitat
preferences:
they
mated
only
within
the
areas
they
preferred
and
so
did
not
mate
with
flies
that
preferred
the
other
areas
diane
dodd
was
also
able
to
show
how
reproductive
isolation
can
develop
from
mating
preferences
in
drosophila
pseudoobscura
fruit
flies
after
only
eight
generations
using
different
food
types
starch
and
maltose
dodd's
experiment
has
been
easy
for
others
to
repeat
it
has
also
been
done
with
other
fruit
flies
and
foods
some
biologists
say
that
evolution
has
happened
when
a
trait
that
is
caused
by
genetics
becomes
more
or
less
common
in
a
group
of
organisms
others
call
it
evolution
when
new
species
appear
changes
can
happen
quickly
in
the
smaller
simpler
organisms
for
example
many
bacteria
that
cause
disease
can
no
longer
be
killed
with
some
of
the
antibiotic
medicines
these
medicines
have
only
been
in
use
about
eighty
years
and
at
first
worked
extremely
well
the
bacteria
have
evolved
so
that
they
are
no
longer
affected
by
antibiotics
anymore
the
drugs
killed
off
all
the
bacteria
except
a
few
which
had
some
resistance
these
few
resistant
bacteria
produced
the
next
generation
the
colorado
beetle
is
famous
for
its
ability
to
resist
pesticides
over
the
last
years
it
has
become
resistant
to
chemical
compounds
used
in
insecticides
including
cyanide
this
is
natural
selection
speeded
up
by
the
artificial
conditions
however
not
every
population
is
resistant
to
every
chemical
the
populations
only
become
resistant
to
chemicals
used
in
their
area
although
there
were
a
number
of
natural
historians
in
the
th
century
who
had
some
idea
of
evolution
the
first
well-formed
ideas
came
in
the
th
century
three
biologists
are
most
important
jean-baptiste
de
lamarck
–
a
french
biologist
claimed
that
animals
changed
according
to
natural
laws
he
said
that
animals
could
pass
on
traits
they
had
acquired
during
their
lifetime
to
their
offspring
using
inheritance
today
his
theory
is
known
as
lamarckism
its
main
purpose
is
to
explain
adaptations
by
natural
means
he
proposed
a
tendency
for
organisms
to
become
more
complex
moving
up
a
ladder
of
progress
plus
use
and
disuse
lamarck's
idea
was
that
a
giraffe's
neck
grew
longer
because
it
tried
to
reach
higher
up
this
idea
failed
because
it
cannot
be
reconciled
with
heredity
mendel's
work
mendel
made
his
discoveries
about
half
a
century
after
lamarck's
work
charles
darwin
–
wrote
his
on
the
origin
of
species
in
in
this
book
he
put
forward
much
evidence
that
evolution
had
occurred
he
also
proposed
natural
selection
as
the
way
evolution
had
taken
place
but
darwin
did
not
understand
about
genetics
and
how
traits
were
actually
passed
on
he
could
not
accurately
explain
what
made
children
look
like
their
parents
nevertheless
darwin's
explanation
of
evolution
was
fundamentally
correct
in
contrast
to
lamarck
darwin's
idea
was
that
the
giraffe's
neck
became
longer
because
those
with
longer
necks
survived
better
p/
these
survivors
passed
their
genes
on
and
in
time
the
whole
race
got
longer
necks
an
austrian
monk
called
gregor
mendel
–
bred
plants
in
the
mid-th
century
he
discovered
how
traits
were
passed
on
from
one
generation
to
the
next
he
used
peas
for
his
experiments:
some
peas
have
white
flowers
and
others
have
red
ones
some
peas
have
green
seeds
and
others
have
yellow
seeds
mendel
used
artificial
pollination
to
breed
the
peas
his
results
are
discussed
further
in
mendelian
inheritance
darwin
thought
that
the
inheritance
from
both
parents
blended
together
mendel
proved
that
the
genes
from
the
two
parents
stay
separate
and
may
be
passed
on
unchanged
to
later
generations
mendel
published
his
results
in
a
journal
that
was
not
well-known
and
his
discoveries
were
overlooked
around
his
work
was
rediscovered
genes
are
bits
of
information
made
of
dna
which
work
like
a
set
of
instructions
a
set
of
genes
are
in
every
living
cell
together
genes
organise
the
way
an
egg
develops
into
an
adult
with
mammals
and
many
other
living
things
a
copy
of
each
gene
comes
from
the
father
and
another
copy
from
the
mother
some
living
organisms
including
some
plants
only
have
one
parent
so
get
all
their
genes
from
them
these
genes
produce
the
genetic
differences
which
evolution
acts
on
darwin's
on
the
origin
of
species
has
two
themes:
the
evidence
for
evolution
and
his
ideas
on
how
evolution
took
place
this
section
deals
with
the
second
issue
the
first
two
chapters
of
the
origin
deal
with
variation
in
domesticated
plants
and
animals
and
variation
in
nature
all
living
things
show
variation
every
population
which
has
been
studied
shows
that
animal
and
plants
vary
as
much
as
humans
do
p
this
is
a
great
fact
of
nature
and
without
it
evolution
would
not
occur
darwin
said
that
just
as
man
selects
what
he
wants
in
his
farm
animals
so
in
nature
the
variations
allow
natural
selection
to
work
the
features
of
an
individual
are
influenced
by
two
things
heredity
and
environment
first
development
is
controlled
by
genes
inherited
from
the
parents
second
living
brings
its
own
influences
some
things
are
entirely
inherited
others
partly
and
some
not
inherited
at
all
the
colour
of
eyes
is
entirely
inherited
they
are
a
genetic
trait
height
or
weight
is
only
partly
inherited
and
the
language
is
not
at
all
inherited
just
to
be
clear:
the
fact
that
humans
can
speak
is
inherited
but
what
language
is
spoken
depends
on
where
a
person
lives
and
what
they
are
taught
another
example:
a
person
inherits
a
brain
of
somewhat
variable
capacity
what
happens
after
birth
depends
on
many
things
such
as
home
environment
education
and
other
experiences
when
a
person
is
adult
their
brain
is
what
their
inheritance
and
life
experience
have
made
it
evolution
only
concerns
the
traits
which
can
be
inherited
wholly
or
partly
the
hereditary
traits
are
passed
on
from
one
generation
to
the
next
through
the
genes
a
person's
genes
contain
all
the
traits
which
they
inherit
from
their
parents
the
accidents
of
life
are
not
passed
on
also
of
course
each
person
lives
a
somewhat
different
life:
that
increases
the
differences
organisms
in
any
population
vary
in
reproductive
success
p
from
the
point
of
view
of
evolution
'reproductive
success'
means
the
total
number
of
offspring
which
live
to
breed
and
leave
offspring
themselves
variation
can
only
affect
future
generations
if
it
is
inherited
because
of
the
work
of
gregor
mendel
we
know
that
much
variation
is
inherited
mendel's
'factors'
are
now
called
genes
research
has
shown
that
almost
every
individual
in
a
sexually
reproducing
species
is
genetically
unique
pgenetic
variation
is
increased
by
gene
mutations
dna
does
not
always
reproduce
exactly
rare
changes
occur
and
these
changes
can
be
inherited
many
changes
in
dna
cause
faults
some
are
neutral
or
even
advantageous
this
gives
rise
to
genetic
variation
which
is
the
seed-corn
of
evolution
sexual
reproduction
by
the
crossing
over
of
chromosomes
during
meiosis
spreads
variation
through
the
population
other
events
like
natural
selection
and
drift
reduce
variation
so
a
population
in
the
wild
always
has
variation
but
the
details
are
always
changing
p
evolution
mainly
works
by
natural
selection
what
does
this
mean?
animals
and
plants
which
are
best
suited
to
their
environment
will
on
average
survive
better
there
is
a
struggle
for
existence
those
who
survive
will
produce
the
next
generation
their
genes
will
be
passed
on
and
the
genes
of
those
who
did
not
reproduce
will
not
this
is
the
basic
mechanism
which
changes
a
population
and
causes
evolution
natural
selection
explains
why
living
organisms
change
over
time
to
have
the
anatomy
the
functions
and
behaviour
that
they
have
it
works
like
this:
all
living
things
have
such
fertility
that
their
population
size
could
increase
rapidly
for
ever
we
see
that
the
size
of
populations
does
not
increase
to
this
extent
mostly
numbers
remain
about
the
same
the
food
and
other
resources
are
limited
therefore
there
is
competition
for
food
and
resources
no
two
individuals
are
alike
therefore
they
will
not
have
the
same
chances
to
live
and
reproduce
much
of
this
variation
can
be
inherited
parents
pass
such
traits
to
the
children
through
their
genes
the
next
generation
can
only
come
from
those
that
survive
and
reproduce
after
many
generations
of
this
the
population
will
have
more
helpful
genetic
differences
and
fewer
harmful
ones
natural
selection
is
really
a
process
of
elimination
p
the
elimination
is
being
caused
by
the
relative
fit
between
individuals
and
the
environment
they
live
in
there
are
now
many
cases
where
natural
selection
has
been
proved
to
occur
in
wild
populations
almost
every
case
investigated
of
camouflage
mimicry
and
polymorphism
has
shown
strong
effects
of
selection
the
force
of
selection
can
be
much
stronger
than
was
thought
by
the
early
population
geneticists
the
resistance
to
pesticides
has
grown
quickly
resistance
to
warfarin
in
norway
rats
rattus
norvegicus
grew
rapidly
because
those
that
survived
made
up
more
and
more
of
the
population
research
showed
that
in
the
absence
of
warfarin
the
resistant
homozygote
was
at
a
disadvantage
to
the
normal
wild
type
homozygote
p
this
great
disadvantage
was
quickly
overcome
by
the
selection
for
warfarin
resistance
mammals
normally
cannot
drink
milk
as
adults
but
humans
are
an
exception
milk
is
digested
by
the
enzyme
lactase
which
switches
off
as
mammals
stop
taking
milk
from
their
mothers
the
human
ability
to
drink
milk
during
adult
life
is
supported
by
a
lactase
mutation
which
prevents
this
switch-off
human
populations
have
a
high
proportion
of
this
mutation
wherever
milk
is
important
in
the
diet
the
spread
of
this
'milk
tolerance'
is
promoted
by
natural
selection
because
it
helps
people
survive
where
milk
is
available
genetic
studies
suggest
that
the
oldest
mutations
causing
lactase
persistence
only
reached
high
levels
in
human
populations
in
the
last
ten
thousand
years
therefore
lactase
persistence
is
often
cited
as
an
example
of
recent
human
evolution
as
lactase
persistence
is
genetic
but
animal
husbandry
a
cultural
trait
this
is
gene–culture
coevolution
adaptation
is
one
of
the
basic
phenomena
of
biology
through
the
process
of
adaptation
an
organism
becomes
better
suited
to
its
habitat
adaptation
is
one
of
the
two
main
processes
that
explain
the
diverse
species
we
see
in
biology
the
other
is
speciation
species-splitting
or
cladogenesis
a
favourite
example
used
today
to
study
the
interplay
of
adaptation
and
speciation
is
the
evolution
of
cichlid
fish
in
african
rivers
and
lakes
when
people
speak
about
adaptation
they
often
mean
something
which
helps
an
animal
or
plant
survive
one
of
the
most
widespread
adaptations
in
animals
is
the
evolution
of
the
eye
another
example
is
the
adaptation
of
horses'
teeth
to
grinding
grass
camouflage
is
another
adaptation
so
is
mimicry
the
better
adapted
animals
are
the
most
likely
to
survive
and
to
reproduce
successfully
natural
selection
an
internal
parasite
such
as
a
fluke
is
a
good
example:
it
has
a
very
simple
bodily
structure
but
still
the
organism
is
highly
adapted
to
its
particular
environment
from
this
we
see
that
adaptation
is
not
just
a
matter
of
visible
traits:
in
such
parasites
critical
adaptations
take
place
in
the
life
cycle
which
is
often
quite
complex
not
all
features
of
an
organism
are
adaptations
p
adaptations
tend
to
reflect
the
past
life
of
a
species
if
a
species
has
recently
changed
its
life
style
a
once
valuable
adaptation
may
become
useless
and
eventually
become
a
dwindling
vestige
adaptations
are
never
perfect
there
are
always
tradeoffs
between
the
various
functions
and
structures
in
a
body
it
is
the
organism
as
a
whole
which
lives
and
reproduces
therefore
it
is
the
complete
set
of

in

there
are
forces
which
add
variation
to
the
population
such
as
mutation
and
forces
which
remove
it
genetic
drift
is
the
name
given
to
random
changes
which
remove
variation
from
a
population
genetic
drift
gets
rid
of

the

n
=

p
it
is
therefore
a
very
weak
evolutionary

pgenetic
drift
explains
how
random
chance
can
affect
evolution
in
surprisingly
big
ways
but
only
when
populations
are
quite
small
overall
its
action
is
to
make
the

more
similar
to
each
other

hence
more
vulnerable

drift
reduces
genetic

in
populations
potentially
reducing

survive

genetic
drift
acts
faster
and
has
more
drastic
results
in

when

♦
cheetahs

we
think
the

was

it
lacks

off
from

the

the
human

often
quoted
as
having
been
through
such
stages

example
when
groups

be
expected
from

are
also
good
examples
these

how

major
part
of
evolutionary

darwin
interpreted
'evolution'
a
word
he
did
not
use
at
first
as
being
about
speciation
that
is
why
he
called
his
famous
book
on
the
origin
of
species
darwin
thought
most
species
arose
directly
from
pre-existing
species
this
is
called
anagenesis:
new
species
by
older
species
changing
now
we
think
most
species
arise
by
previous
species
splitting:
cladogenesis
two
groups
that
start
the
same
can
also
become
very
different
if
they
live
in
different
places
when
a
species
gets
split
into
two
geographical
regions
a
process
starts
each
adapts
to
its
own
situation
after
a
while
individuals
from
one
group
can
no
longer
reproduce
with
the
other
group
two
good
species
have
evolved
from
one
a
german
explorer
moritz
wagner
during
his
three
years
in
algeria
in
the
studied
flightless
beetles
each
species
is
confined
to
a
stretch
of
the
north
coast
between
rivers
which
descend
from
the
atlas
mountains
to
the
mediterranean
as
soon
as
one
crosses
a
river
a
different
but
closely
related
species
appears
he
wrote
later:
a
[new]
species
will
only
[arise]
when
a
few
individuals
[cross]
the
limiting
borders
of
their
range
the
formation
of
a
new
race
will
never
succeed
without
a
long
continued
separation
of
the
colonists
from
the
other
members
of
their
species
this
was
an
early
account
of
the
importance
of
geographical
separation
another
biologist
who
thought
geographical
separation
was
critical
was
ernst
mayr
one
example
of
natural
speciation
is
the
three-spined
stickleback
a
sea
fish
that
after
the
last
ice
age
invaded
freshwater
and
set
up
colonies
in
isolated
lakes
and
streams
over
about
generations
the
sticklebacks
show
great
differences
including
variations
in
fins
changes
in
the
number
or
size
of
their
bony
plates
variable
jaw
structure
and
color
differences
the
wombats
of
australia
fall
into
two
main
groups
common
wombats
and
hairy-nosed
wombats
the
two
types
look
very
similar
apart
from
the
hairiness
of
their
noses
however
they
are
adapted
to
different
environments
common
wombats
live
in
forested
areas
and
eat
mostly
green
food
with
lots
of
moisture
they
often
feed
in
the
daytime
hairy-nosed
wombats
live
on
hot
dry
plains
where
they
eat
dry
grass
with
very
little
water
or
goodness
in
it
their
metabolic
system
is
slow
and
they
sleep
most
of
the
day
underground
when
two
groups
that
started
the
same
become
different
enough
then
they
become
two
different
species
part
of
the
theory
of
evolution
is
that
all
living
things
started
off
the
same
but
then
split
off
into
different
groups
over
billions
of
years
this
was
an
important
movement
in
evolutionary
biology
which
started
in
the
and
finished
in
the
it
has
been
updated
regularly
ever
since
the
synthesis
explains
how
the
ideas
of
charles
darwin
fit
with
the
discoveries
of
gregor
mendel
who
found
out
how
we
inherit
our
genes
the
modern
synthesis
brought
darwin's
idea
up
to
date
it
bridged
the
gap
between
different
types
of
biologists:
geneticists
naturalists
and
palaeontologists
when
the
theory
of
evolution
was
developed
it
was
not
clear
that
natural
selection
and
genetics
worked
together
but
ronald
fisher
showed
that
natural
selection
would
work
to
change
species
sewall
wright
explained
genetic
drift
in
evolution
and
genetics:
evolution
can
be
explained
by
what
we
know
about
genetics
and
what
we
see
of
animals
and
plants
living
in
the
wild
thinking
in
terms
of
populations
rather
than
individuals
is
important
the
genetic
variety
existing
in
natural
populations
is
a
key
factor
in
evolution
evolution
and
fossils:
the
same
factors
which
act
today
also
acted
in
the
past
gradualism:
evolution
is
gradual
and
usually
takes
place
by
small
steps
there
are
some
exceptions
to
this
notably
polyploidy
especially
in
plants
natural
selection:
the
struggle
for
existence
of
animals
and
plant
in
the
wild
causes
natural
selection
the
strength
of
natural
selection
in
the
wild
was
greater
than
even
darwin
expected
genetic
drift
can
be
important
in
small
populations
the
rate
of
evolution
can
vary
there
is
very
good
evidence
from
fossils
that
different
groups
can
evolve
at
different
rates
and
that
different
parts
of
an
animal
can
evolve
at
different
rates
p
co-evolution
is
where
the
existence
of
one
species
is
tightly
bound
up
with
the
life
of
one
or
more
other
species
new
or
'improved'
adaptations
which
occur
in
one
species
are
often
followed
by
the
appearance
and
spread
of
related
features
in
the
other
species
the
life
and
death
of
living
things
is
intimately
connected
not
just
with
the
physical
environment
but
with
the
life
of
other
species
these
relationships
may
continue
for
millions
of
years
as
it
has
in
the
pollination
of
flowering
plants
by
insects
the
gut
contents
wing
structures
and
mouthparts
of
fossilized
beetles
and
flies
suggest
that
they
acted
as
early
pollinators
the
association
between
beetles
and
angiosperms
during
the
lower
cretaceous
period
led
to
parallel
radiations
of
angiosperms
and
insects
into
the
late
cretaceous
the
evolution
of
nectaries
in
upper
cretaceous
flowers
signals
the
beginning
of
the
mutualism
between
hymenoptera
and
angiosperms
charles
darwin
was
the
first
to
use
this
metaphor
in
biology

the
relationships
among
various
biological
groups

includes

in
this
work
is
carl
woese
who
defined

the
third

or

of
life
below
is
a
simplified
version
of
present-day
understanding
macroevolution:
the
study
of
changes
above
the
species
level
and
how
they
take
place
the
basic
data
for
such
a
study
are
fossils
palaeontology
and
the
reconstruction
of
ancient
environments
some
subjects
whose
study
falls
within
the
realm
of
macroevolution:
adaptive

such
as
the
cambrian
explosion
changes
in
biodiversity
through

mass
extinctions
speciation
and
extinction
rates
the
debate
between
punctuated
equilibrium
and
gradualism
the
role
of
development
in
shaping
evolution:
heterochrony
hox
genes
origin
of
major
categories:
cleidoic
egg
origin
of
birds
it
is
a
term
of
convenience:
for
most
biologists
it
does
not
suggest
any
change
in
the
process
of
evolution
p
for
some
palaeontologists
what
they
see
in
the
fossil
record
cannot
be
explained
just
by
the
gradualist
evolutionary
synthesis
they
are
in
the
minority
altruism
–
the
willingness
of
some
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
others
–
is
widespread
in
social
animals
as
explained
above
the
next
generation
can
only
come
from
those
who
survive
and
reproduce
some
biologists
have
thought
that
this
meant
altruism
could
not
evolve
by
the
normal
process
of
selection
instead
a
process
called
group
selection
was
proposed
group
selection
refers
to
the
idea
that
alleles
can
become
fixed
or
spread
in
a
population
because
of
the
benefits
they
bestow
on
groups
regardless
of
the
alleles'
effect
on
the
fitness
of
individuals
within
that
group
for
several
decades
critiques
cast
serious
doubt
on
group
selection
as
a
major
mechanism
of
evolution
in
simple
cases
it
can
be
seen
at
once
that
traditional
selection
suffices
for
example
if
one
sibling
sacrifices
itself
for
three
siblings
the
genetic
disposition
for
the
act
will
be
increased
this
is
because
siblings
share
on
average
of
their
genetic
inheritance
and
the
sacrificial
act
has
led
to
greater
representation
of
the
genes
in
the
next
generation
altruism
is
now
generally
seen
as
emerging
from
standard
selection
the
warning
note
from
ernst
mayr
and
the
work
of
william
hamilton
are
both
important
to
this
discussion
hamilton's
equation
describes
whether
or
not
a
gene
for
altruistic
behaviour
will
spread
in
a
population
the
gene
will
spread
if
rxb
is
greater
than
c:
r
b
c
\displaystyle
rbc\
where:
c
\displaystyle
c\
is
the
reproductive
cost
to
the
altruist
b
\displaystyle
b\
is
the
reproductive
benefit
to
the
recipient
of
the
altruistic
behavior
and
r
\displaystyle
r\
is
the
probability
above
the
population
average
of
the
individuals
sharing
an
altruistic
gene
–
the
degree
of
relatedness
at
first
sexual
reproduction
might
seem
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
compared
with
asexual
reproduction
in
order
to
be
advantageous
sexual
reproduction
cross-fertilisation
has
to
overcome
a
two-fold
disadvantage
takes
two
to
reproduce
plus
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
mate
why
then
is
sex
so
nearly
universal
among
eukaryotes?
this
is
one
of
the
oldest
questions
in
biology
the
answer
has
been
given
since
darwin's
time:
because
the
sexual
populations
adapt
better
to
changing
circumstances
a
recent
laboratory
experiment
suggests
this
is
indeed
the
correct
explanation
when
populations
are
outcrossed
genetic
recombination
occurs
between
different
parental
genomes
this
allows
beneficial
mutations
to
escape
deleterious
alleles
on
its
original
background
and
to
combine
with
other
beneficial
alleles
that
arise
elsewhere
in
the
population
in
selfing
populations
individuals
are
largely
homozygous
and
recombination
has
no
effect
in
the
main
experiment
nematode
worms
were
divided
into
two
groups
one
group
was
entirely
outcrossing
the
other
was
entirely
selfing
the
groups
were
subjected
to
a
rugged
terrain
and
repeatedly
subjected
to
a
mutagen
after
generations
the
selfing
population
showed
a
substantial
decline
in
fitness
=
survival
whereas
the
outcrossing
population
showed
no
decline
this
is
one
of
a
number
of
studies
that
show
sexuality
to
have
real
advantages
over
non-sexual
types
of
reproduction
an
important
activity
is
artificial
selection
for
domestication
this
is
when
people
choose
which
animals
to
breed
from
based
on
their
traits
humans
have
used
this
for
thousands
of
years
to
domesticate
plants
and
animals
more
recently
it
has
become
possible
to
use
genetic
engineering
new
techniques
such
as
'gene
targeting'
are
now
available
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
insert
new
genes
or
knock
out
old
genes
from
the
genome
of
a
plant
or
animal
a
number
of
nobel
prizes
have
already
been
awarded
for
this
work
however
the
real
purpose
of
studying
evolution
is
to
explain
and
help
our
understanding
of
biology
after
all
it
is
the
first
good
explanation
of
how
living
things
came
to
be
the
way
they
are
that
is
a
big
achievement
the
practical
things
come
mostly
from
genetics
the

by
gregor
mendel
and
from

the

the
idea
that
all
life
evolved
had
been
proposed
before
charles
darwin
published
on
the
origin
of
species
even
today
some
people
still
discuss
the
concept
of
evolution
and
what
it
means
to
them
their
philosophy
and
their
religion
evolution
does
explain
some
things
about
our
human
nature
people
also
talk
about
the
social
implications
of
evolution
for
example
in
sociobiology
some
people
have
the
religious
belief
that
life
on
earth
was
created
by
a
god
in
order
to
fit
in
the
idea
of
evolution
with
that
belief
people
have
used
ideas
like
guided
evolution
or
theistic
evolution
they
say
that
evolution
is
real
but
is
being
guided
in
some
way
there
are
many
different
concepts
of
theistic
evolution
many
creationists
believe
that
the
creation
myth
found
in
their
religion
goes
against
the
idea
of
evolution
as
darwin
realised
the
most
controversial
part
of
the
evolutionary
thought
is
what
it
means
for
human
origins
in
some
countries
especially
in
the
united
states
there
is
tension
between
people
who
accept
the
idea
of
evolution
and
those
who
do
not
accept
it
the
debate
is
mostly
about
whether
evolution
should
be
taught
in
schools
and
in
what
way
this
should
be
done
other
fields
like
cosmology
and
earth
science
also
do
not
match
with
the
original
writings
of
many
religious
texts
these
ideas
were
once
also
fiercely
opposed
death
for
heresy
was
threatened
to
those
who
wrote
against
the
idea
that
earth
was
the
center
of
the
universe
evolutionary
biology
is
a
more
recent
idea
certain
religious
groups
oppose
the
idea
of
evolution
more
than
other
religious
groups
do
for
instance
the
roman
catholic
church
now
has
the
following
position
on
evolution:
pope
pius
xii
said
in
his
encyclical
humani
generis
published
in
the
s:
the
church
does
not
forbid
that
research
and
discussions
take
place
with
regard
to
the
doctrine
of
evolution
in
as
far
as
it
inquires
into
the
origin
of
the
human
body
as
coming
from
pre-existent
and
living
matter
pope
pius
xii
humani
generispope
john
paul
ii
updated
this
position
in
he
said
that
evolution
was
more
than
a
hypothesis:
in
his
encyclical
humani
generis
my
predecessor
pius
xii
has
already
[said]
that
there
is
no
conflict
between
evolution
and
the
doctrine
of
the
faith
regarding
man
and
his
vocation
today
more
than
a
half-century
after
that
encyclical
some
new
findings
lead
us
toward
the
recognition
of
evolution
as
more
than
an
hypothesis
in
fact
it
is
remarkable
that
this
theory
has
had
progressively
greater
influence
on
the
spirit
of
researchers
following
a
series
of
discoveries
in
different
scholarly
disciplines
pope
john
paul
ii
speaking
to
the
pontifical
academy
of
sciencethe
anglican
communion
also
does
not
oppose
the
scientific
account
of
evolution
many
of
those
who
accepted
evolution
were
not
much
interested
in
biology
they
were
interested
in
using
the
theory
to
support
their
own
ideas
on
society
some
people
have
tried
to
use
evolution
to
support
racism
people
wanting
to
justify
racism
claimed
that
certain
groups
such
as
black
people
were
inferior
in
nature
some
animals
do
survive
better
than
others
and
it
does
lead
to
animals
better
adapted
to
their
circumstances
with
humans
groups
from
different
parts
of
the
world
all
evolution
can
say
is
that
each
group
is
probably
well
suited
to
its
original
situation
evolution
makes
no
judgements
about
better
or
worse
it
does
not
say
that
any
human
group
is
superior
to
any
other
this
amazing
idea
of
eugenics
was
rather
different
two
things
had
been
noticed
as
far
back
as
the
th
century
one
was
the
great
success
of
farmers
in
breeding
cattle
and
crop
plants
they
did
this
by
selecting
which
animals
or
plants
would
produce
the
next
generation
artificial
selection
the
other
observation
was
that
lower
class
people
had
more
children
than
upper-class
people
if
and
it's
a
big
if
the
higher
classes
were
there
on
merit
then
their
lack
of
children
was
the
exact
reverse
of
what
should
be
happening
faster
breeding
in
the
lower
classes
would
lead
to
the
society
getting
worse
the
idea
to
improve
the
human
species
by
selective
breeding
is
called
eugenics
the
name
was
proposed
by
francis
galton
a
bright
scientist
who
meant
to
do
good
he
said
that
the
human
stock
gene
pool
should
be
improved
by
selective
breeding
policies
this
would
mean
that
those
who
were
considered
good
stock
would
receive
a
reward
if
they
reproduced
however
other
people
suggested
that
those
considered
bad
stock
would
need
to
undergo
compulsory
sterilization
prenatal
testing
and
birth
control
the
german
nazi
government
–
used
eugenics
as
a
cover
for
their
extreme
racial
policies
with
dreadful
results
the
problem
with
galton's
idea
is
how
to
decide
which
features
to
select
there
are
so
many
different
skills
people
could
have
you
could
not
agree
who
was
good
stock
and
who
was
bad
stock
there
was
rather
more
agreement
on
who
should
not
be
breeding
several
countries
passed
laws
for
the
compulsory
sterilisation
of
unwelcome
groups
most
of
these
laws
were
passed
between
and
after
world
war
ii
disgust
at
what
the
nazis
had
done
squashed
any
more
attempts
at
eugenics
some
equations
can
be
solved
using
algorithms
that
simulate
evolution
evolutionary
algorithms
work
like
that
another
example
of
using
ideas
about
evolution
to
support
social
action
is
social
darwinism
social
darwinism
is
a
term
given
to
the
ideas
of
the
th
century
social
philosopher
herbert
spencer
spencer
believed
the
survival
of
the
fittest
could
and
should
be
applied
to
commerce
and
human
societies
as
a
whole
again
some
people
used
these
ideas
to
claim
that
racism
and
ruthless
economic
policies
were
justified
today
most
biologists
and
philosophers
say
that
the
theory
of
evolution
should
not
be
applied
to
social
policy
some
people
disagree
with
the
idea
of
evolution
they
disagree
with
it
for
a
number
of
reasons
most
often
these
reasons
are
influenced
by
or
based
on
their
religious
beliefs
people
who
do
not
agree
with
evolution
usually
believe
in
creationism
or
intelligent
design
despite
this
evolution
is
one
of
the
most
successful
theories
in
science
people
have
discovered
it
to
be
useful
for
different
kinds
of
research
none
of
the
other
suggestions
explain
things
such
as
fossil
records
as
well
so
for
almost
all
scientists
evolution
is
not
in
doubt
human
evolution
there
are
different
organ
systems
such
as
the
cardiovascular
system
also
known
as
the
circulatory
system
the
system
that
gets
blood
around
the

cancer
is
one
of
the
most
common
causes
of
death
around
the
world
it
causes
about
or
one
out
of
every
eight
of
all
deaths
worldwide
according
to
the
world
health
organization
different
types
of
cancer
have
different
causes
some
things
are
known
to
cause
cancer
in
a
specific
body
part
other
things
are
known
to
be
able
to
cause
many
different
types
of
cancer
for
example
using
tobacco
smoked
or
smokeless
can
cause
many
types
of
cancers
such
as
lung
mouth
tongue
and
throat
cancers
other
things
that
are
known
to
be
able
to
cause
cancer
-
or
make
a
person
more
likely
to
get
cancer
-
include:
radiation
including
sunlight
and
x-rays
in
large
or
many
doses
and
exposure
to
radiation
for
example
in
a
nuclear
power
plant
chemicals
and
materials
used
in
building
and
manufacturing
for
example
asbestos
and
benzene
high-fat
or
low-fiber
diets
air
and
water
pollution
eating
very
little
fruits
and
vegetables
obesity
not
enough
physical
activity
drinking
too
much
alcohol
and
certain
chemicals
commonly
used
at
home
some
cancers
can
also
be
caused
by
viruses
many
people
who
are
exposed
to
these
things
do
get
cancer
-
but
some
do
not
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
cancers
some
of
the
most
common
are:
breast
cancer
brain
cancer
leukemia
a
blood
cancer
testicular
cancer
mesothelioma
which
starts
in
the
lungs
and
is
usually
caused
by
breathing
in
asbestos
for
long
periods
of
time
lung
cancer
there
is
no
sure
cure
for
cancer
it
can
only
be
cured
if
all
of
the
cancerous
cells
are
cut
out
or
killed
in
place
this
means
that
the
earlier
the
cancer
is
treated
the
better
the
chances
are
for
a
cure
because
the
cancer
cells
may
not
have
had
enough
time
to
copy
themselves
and
spread
so
much
that
the
person
cannot
be
cured
there
are
a
few
different
types
of
treatments
that
are
used
to
try
to
kill
cancer
cells
these
treatments
are:
radiotherapy
radiation
therapy
which
uses
radiation
to
kill
cancer
cells
chemotherapy
which
uses
strong
medications
to
kill
cancer
cells
immunotherapy
works
by
inducing
enhancing
or
suppressing
an
immune
response
surgery
to
take
out
part
or
all
of
a
tumor
after
surgery
many
patients
may
need
radiotherapy
or
chemotherapy
to
keep
the
tumor
from
growing
again
there
are
a
few
reasons
why
treating
cancer
is
complicated
for
example:
most
things
that
kill
cancer
cells
also
kill
normal
healthy
cells
this
can
cause
many
side
effects
like
hair
loss
and
vomiting
the
body's
immune
system
usually
will
not
attack
cancer
cells
even
though
they
could
easily
kill
the
body
this
is
because
the
cancer
has
actually
become
a
part
of
the
body
by
invading
cells
and
tissues
so
the
immune
system
sees
the
cancer
as
part
of
the
body
it
is
trying
to
protect
not
as
a
threat
to
be
attacked
there
are
many
different
types
of
cancer
and
each
has
its
own
symptoms
and
causes
even
with
the
same
type
of
cancer
different
people
may
have
different
symptoms
and
may
react
to
treatments
differently
their
cancer
also
may
grow
or
spread
at
different
speeds
treatment
has
to
be
a
good
fit
to
both
the
type
of
cancer
and
the
individual
patient
who
has
the
cancer
many
many
people
in
many
countries
study
cancer
and
work
on
finding
treatments
there
has
been
some
good
progress
in
finding
treatments
and
many
cancers
are
treated
with
success
along
with
looking
for
different
medical
treatments
to
treat
cancer
some
studies
also
look
for
things
that
people
with
cancer
can
do
themselves
to
try
to
make
themselves
healthier
for
example
one
study
showed
that
if
a
person
with
lymphedema
a
swelling
of
the
arm
linked
to
breast
cancer
lifts
weights
he
may
be
able
to
fight
his
cancer
better
than
somebody
who
does
not
lift
weights
cancer
has
been
around
for
many
thousands
of
years
today
a
lot
of
the
medical
terms
used
to
describe
cancer
come
from
ancient
greek
and
latin
for
example
the
latinized
greek
word
carcinoma
is
used
to
describe
a
malignant
tumor
-
a
tumor
made
up
of
cancer
cells
the
greeks
also
used
the
word
karkinos
which
would
be
translated
by
aulus
cornelius
celsus
into
the
latin
word
cancer
the
prefix
'carcino'
is
still
used
in
medical
words
like
carcinoma
and
carcinogenic
a
famous
greek
doctor
galen
helped
create
another
word
that
is
very
important
to
medicine
today
by
using
the
word
onkos
to
describe
all
tumours
this
is
where
the
word
oncology
the
branch
of
medicine
that
deals
with
cancer
comes
from
hippocrates
a
very
famous
ancient
doctor
who
is
often
called
the
father
of
modern
medicine
named
many
kinds
of
cancer
he
called
benign
tumours
tumors
that
are
not
made
up
of
cancer
cells
oncos
in
greek
onkos
means
'swelling'
he
called
malignant
tumours
karkinos
this
means
crab
or
crayfish
in
greek
he
used
this
term
because
he
thought
that
if
a
solid
malignant
tumor
was
cut
into
its
veins
looked
like
a
crab:
the
veins
stretched
on
all
sides
as
the
animal
the
crab
has
its
feet
whence
it
derives
gets
its
name
hippocrates
later
added
-oma
greek
for
'swelling'
after
the
word
'carcinos'
this
is
how
the
word
carcinoma
came
about
because
the
ancient
greeks
did
not
believe
in
opening
up
dead
bodies
to
study
them
hippocrates
was
only
able
to
describe
and
make
drawings
of
tumors
he
saw
from
the
outside
of
the
body
he
drew
tumors
that
had
been
on
the
skin
nose
and
breasts
hippocrates
and
other
doctors
at
that
time
treated
people
based
on
the
humor
theory
this
theory
said
that
there
were
four
types
of
fluid
in
the
body
black
yellow
bile
blood
and
phlegm
doctors
tried
to
figure
out
whether
these
four
humors
or
body
fluids
were
in
balance
they
would
then
use
treatments
like
blood-letting
cutting
the
patient
and
letting
him
bleed
so
that
he
would
lose
blood
laxatives
giving
the
patient
foods
or
herbs
to
make
him
go
to
the
bathroom
and/or
changing
the
patient's
diet
the
doctors
thought
that
these
treatments
would
work
to
get
the
patient's
four
humors
back
into
the
right
balance
the
humor
theory
treatment
was
popular
until
the
th
century
the
when
cells
were
discovered
by
this
time
people
had
realized
that
cancer
can
happen
anywhere
in
the
body
the
oldest
known
document
that
talks
about
cancer
was
discovered
in
egypt
and
is
thought
to
be
from
about
b
c
the
document
talks
about
using
surgery
to
treat
eight
cases
of
ulcers
of
the
breast
these
were
treated
by
cauterization
-
by
burning
them
-
using
a
tool
called
the
fire
drill
the
document
also
says
about
cancer
there
is
no
treatment
another
very
early
type
of
surgery
used
to
treat
cancer
was
written
about
in
the
in
the
canon
of
medicine
avicenna
ibn
sina
said
that
treatment
should
involve
cutting
out
all
diseased
tissue
this
included
the
use
of
amputation
removing
a
part
of
the
body
completely
or
removing
veins
that
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
tumor
avicenna
also
suggested
that
the
area
that
had
been
treated
should
be
cauterized
or
burned
if
needed
in
the
th
and
th
centuries
the
and
doctors
started
to
be
allowed
to
dissect
bodies
or
cut
them
open
after
death
in
order
to
figure
out
the
cause
of
death
around
this
time
there
were
many
different
ideas
about
what
caused
cancer
the
german
professor
wilhelm
fabry
believed
that
breast
cancer
was
caused
by
a
clot
of
milk
in
the
part
of
a
woman's
breast
that
produces
milk
the
dutch
professor
francois
de
la
boe
sylvius
believed
that
all
disease
was
caused
by
chemical
processes
he
thought
that
cancer
in
particular
was
caused
by
acidic
lymph
nicolaes
tulp
who
lived
at
the
same
time
as
sylvius
believed
that
cancer
was
a
poison
that
slowly
spreads
and
was
contagious
a
british
surgeon
named
percivall
pott
was
the
first
person
to
figure
out
one
of
the
real
causes
of
cancer
in
he
discovered
that
cancer
of
the
scrotum
was
a
common
disease
among
chimney
sweeps
people
who
cleaned
out
chimneys
other
doctors
started
studying
this
topic
and
coming
up
with
other
ideas
about
what
causes
cancer
doctors
then
started
working
together
and
coming
up
with
better
ideas
in
the
th
century
the
many
people
started
to
use
the
microscope
and
this
made
a
big
difference
in
helping
doctors
and
scientists
understand
more
about
cancer
using
the
microscope
scientists
were
able
to
see
that
the
'cancer
poison'
spread
from
one
tumor
through
the
lymph
nodes
to
other
sites
metastasis
this
was
first
made
clear
by
the
english
surgeon
campbell
de
morgan
between
and
before
the
th
century
the
using
surgery
to
treat
cancer
usually
had
bad
results
doctors
did
not
understand
how
important
hygiene
or
keeping
things
clean
is
for
preventing
disease
especially
after
surgery
because
things
were
not
kept
clean
during
or
after
surgery
patients
often
got
infections
and
died
for
example
one
well-known
scottish
surgeon
alexander
monro
kept
records
and
found
that
patients
out
of
every
who
had
surgery
for
breast
tumors
died
within
the
next
two
years
in
the
th
century
surgical
hygiene
got
better
because
of
asepsis
doctors
realized
that
dirtiness
and
germs
cause
infections
so
they
started
to
keep
things
cleaner
and
do
things
to
kill
germs
in
order
to
prevent
their
patients
from
getting
infections
it
became
more
common
for
people
to
survive
after
having
surgery
surgical
removal
of
the
tumor
taking
the
tumor
out
of
the
body
by
doing
surgery
became
the
first-choice
treatment
for
cancer
for
this
kind
of
treatment
to
work
the
surgeon
doing
the
operation
had
to
be
very
good
at
removing
tumors
this
meant
that
even
if
people
had
the
same
kind
of
cancer
they
could
get
very
different
results
with
some
getting
good
treatment
that
worked
and
others
getting
treatment
that
did
not
work
because
of
differences
in
how
good
different
surgeons
were
in
the
late
doctors
and
scientists
started
to
realize
that
the
body
is
made
up
of
many
kinds
of
tissues
which
in
turn
are
made
up
of
millions
of
cells
the
discovery
started
the
age
of
cellular
pathology
studying
cells
to
learn
about
diseases
and
figure
out
what
is
wrong
with
the
body
in
the
french
scientists
discovered
radioactive
decay
radiation
therapy
became
the
first
cancer
treatment
that
worked
and
did
not
involve
surgery
it
required
a
new
multi-disciplinary
approach
to
cancer
treatment
people
doing
different
jobs
were
working
together
to
treat
patients
the
surgeon
was
no
longer
working
by
himself
-
he
worked
together
with
hospital
radiologists
people
who
gave
and
read
x-rays
to
help
patients
this
team
approach
meant
changes
in
how
they
worked
the
different
people
on
the
team
had
to
communicate
with
each
other
and
work
together
which
they
were
not
used
to
doing
it
also
meant
that
treatment
had
to
be
done
in
a
hospital
rather
than
at
the
patient's
home
because
of
this
patients'
information
had
to
be
put
together
into
files
kept
at
the
hospital
called
medical
records
because
this
information
was
now
being
kept
and
written
down
scientists
were
able
to
do
the
first
statistical
patient
studies
using
numbers
to
study
questions
like
how
many
people
who
have
a
certain
type
of
cancer
or
get
a
certain
treatment
survive
another
important
step
forward
in
understanding
cancer
happened
in
when
janet
lane-claypon
published
a
paper
on
cancer
epidemiology
epidemiology
is
a
field
of
study
which
looks
at
how
common
a
disease
is
what
patterns
the
disease
takes
in
different
kinds
of
people
and
what
this
means
for
understanding
and
treating
the
disease
this
historic
paper
was
a
comparative
study
which
tries
to
find
out
what
causes
a
disease
by
looking
at
a
group
of
people
who
have
the
disease
and
figuring
out
how
they
are
different
from
another
group
that
does
not
have
the
disease
lane-clayton's
study
looked
at
people
who
all
had
the
same
background
and
lifestyle
or
way
of
living:
people
with
breast
cancer
and
control
patients
people
without
breast
cancer
these
people
were
the
same
in
many
ways
but
some
got
breast
cancer
and
some
did
not
to
figure
out
what
might
be
causing
certain
people
to
get
breast
cancer
the
study
looked
at
what
was
different
about
these
people
when
they
were
compared
to
or
looked
at
alongside
the
people
who
did
not
get
cancer
lane-clayton's
study
was
published
by
the
british
ministry
of
health
her
work
on
cancer
epidemiology
was
continued
by
richard
doll
and
austin
bradford
hill
they
used
the
same
ways
of
studying
cancer
as
lane-clayton
but
they
looked
at
a
different
kind
of
cancer:
lung
cancer
in
they
published
their
results
in
a
paper
called
lung
cancer
and
other
causes
of
death
in
relation
to
smoking
a
second
report
on
the
mortality
of
british
doctors
also
called
the
british
doctors
study
later
richard
doll
left
the
london
medical
research
center
mrc
and
started
the
oxford
unit
for
cancer
epidemiology
in
by
using
computers
this
unit
was
able
to
do
something
new
and
very
important:
it
brought
together
large
amounts
of
cancer
data
pieces
of
information
about
cancer
this
way
of
studying
cancer
is
very
important
to
cancer
epidemiology
today
and
it
has
also
been
very
important
in
shaping
what
we
now
know
about
cancer
and
what
the
rules
and
laws
about
the
disease
and
public
health
are
today
over
the
past
years
many
different
people
have
done
a
lot
of
work
to
collect
data
from
different
doctors
hospitals
areas
states
and
even
countries
this
data
is
used
to
study
whether
different
kinds
of
cancer
are
more
or
less
common
in
different
areas
environments
for
example
in
big
cities
compared
to
the
countryside
or
cultures
this
helps
people
who
study
cancer
to
figure
out
what
makes
people
more
or
less
likely
to
get
different
kinds
of
cancer
before
world
war
ii
doctors
and
hospitals
were
getting
better
at
collecting
or
getting
and
keeping
data
about
their
patients
who
had
cancer
but
it
was
rare
for
this
data
to
be
shared
with
other
doctors
or
hospitals
this
changed
after
wwii
when
medical
research
centers
found
out
that
different
countries
had
very
different
number
of
cases
of
cancer
because
of
this
many
countries
created
national
public
health
organizations
which
studied
public
health
issues
in
an
entire
country
these
national
public
health
organizations
began
to
bring
together
health
data
from
many
different
doctors
and
hospitals
this
helped
them
figure
out
some
of
the
reasons
why
cancer
was
so
much
more
common
in
certain
places
for
example
in
japan
people
studying
cancer
found
out
that
people
who
had
survived
the
atomic
bombings
of
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
had
bone
marrow
that
was
completely
destroyed
this
helped
them
realize
that
diseased
bone
marrow
could
also
be
destroyed
with
radiation
which
was
a
very
important
step
in
figuring
out
that
leukemia
a
blood
cancer
can
be
treated
with
bone
marrow
transplants
since
world
war
ii
scientists
have
kept
finding
better
cancer
treatments
however
there
are
some
things
that
still
need
to
get
better
for
example
while
there
are
good
treatments
for
many
kinds
of
cancer
there
are
still
no
treatments
for
certain
kinds
of
cancer
or
for
some
cancers
once
they
progress
or
get
worse
to
a
certain
stage
of
the
disease
also
the
cancer
treatments
that
do
exist
are
not
all
standardized
there
is
not
one
agreed-upon
way
of
giving
every
treatment
which
is
used
each
time
the
treatment
is
given
cancer
treatments
are
also
not
available
everywhere
in
the
world
people
need
to
keep
studying
cancer
epidemiology
and
forming
international
partnerships
where
different
countries
work
together
to
find
cures
and
make
cancer
treatments
available
everywhere
there
are
several
species
kinds
of
plasmodium
that
cause
malaria
in
humans:
serious
disease:
plasmodium
falciparum
milder
disease:
plasmodium
malariae
plasmodium
ovale
plasmodium
vivax
species
which
normally
infect
other
primates:
plasmodium
knoweslip
vivax
and
p
falciparum
cause
the
most
malaria
in
people
falciparum
malaria
is
the
worst
kind
and
kills
the
most
people
when
plasmodium
enters
the
blood
they
are
then
called
sporozoites
sporozoites
go
to
the
liver
where
they
make
many
more
sporozoites
then
they
change
into
a
different
form
of
plasmodium
this
form
is
the
merozoite
the
merozoites
go
into
the
red
blood
cells
then
they
make
many
more
merozoites
the
merozoites
break
out
of
the
red
blood
cells
again
and
again
when
they
do
this
the
person
gets
very
sick
and
shows
symptoms
of
malaria
this
happens
every
few
days
and
is
called
a
paroxysm
p
vivax
and
p
ovale
can
live
in
the
liver
for
a
long
time
a
person
can
look
well
but
still
have
the
plasmodium
in
the
liver
this
is
called
a
dormant
phase
weeks
or
months
later
the
plasmodium
can
leave
the
liver
to
the
blood
and
the
person
will
get
sick
again
p
falciparum
is
the
most
dangerous
type
of
malaria
it
makes
people
sicker
than
those
with
other
types
of
malaria
because
there
are
more
of
them
in
the
blood
also
with
falciparum
malaria
the
red
blood
cells
are
sticky
this
makes
the
red
blood
cells
block
blood
vessels
if
blood
vessels
are
blocked
this
can
hurt
what
the
blood
vessel
brings
blood
to
and
can
hurt
people's
organs
pregnant
women
and
children
are
hurt
most
by
malaria
when
they
get
malaria
they
get
sicker
of
people
live
in
a
place
where
there
is
malaria
malaria
is
in
these
places:
africa
asia
mostly
in
india
the
middle
east
and
southeast
asia
central
and
south
america
hispaniola
eastern
europe
south
pacific
the
part
of
the
pacific
ocean
south
of
the
equatorevery
year
to
million
people
get
malaria
it
kills
million
to
million
people
every
year
of
the
deaths
occur
in
africa
most
of
the
people
who
die
from
malaria
are
children
even
if
children
do
not
die
many
have
brain
damage
many
of
these
deaths
might
be
stopped
with
medicine
or
mosquito
control
but
many
of
the
places
malaria
may
be
found
are
in
poor
countries
these
countries
do
not
have
enough
money
to
stop
the
mosquitoes
or
to
give
people
medicine
money
however
is
not
the
only
problem
a
country
must
have
an
organised
medical
system
to
provide
services
many
countries
in
central
africa
have
been
disrupted
by
warfare
and
conflict
between
groups
and
general
unrest
also
easy
solutions
to
kill
the
parasites
do
not
exist
as
they
did
years
ago
this
is
because
the
insects
are
resistant
to
many
insecticides
and
the
plasmodium
parasite
is
highly
resistant
to
quinine
and
most
other
common
drugs
this
is
a
normal
evolutionary
process:
the
chemicals
weed
out
the
non-resistant
organisms
and
the
offspring
of
the
few
resistant
organisms
multiply
symptoms
are
changes
in
someone's
body
that
are
signs
for
a
disease
most
people
who
get
malaria
get
symptoms
–
days
after
they
get
infected
the
plasmodium
gets
in
their
blood
but
some
people
can
get
symptoms
after
only
a
week
and
some
may
be
infected
with
malaria
and
not
have
symptoms
for
a
year
the
most
common
symptom
of
malaria
is
fever
when
the
body
temperature
is
high
the
fever
from
malaria
usually
comes
very
suddenly
the
people
who
have
malaria
often
feel
like
they
had
influenza
symptoms
of
malaria
are:
arthralgia
pain
in
joints
headache
pain
in
head
feeling
very
tired
or
sleepy
cough
chills
feeling
very
cold
delirium
when
people
are
very
confused
because
of
a
disease
they
may
look
drunk
they
may
not
be
able
to
talk
coma
when
people
are
not
conscious
they
look
like
they
are
asleep
but
they
cannot
be
woken
signs
of
malaria:
anemia
low
red
blood
cell
levels
in
the
blood
diarrhea
jaundice
yellow
skin
and
eyes
sweating
vomiting
fast
heart
rate
low
blood
pressure
enlarged
organs
when
something
becomes
enlarged
or
bigger
than
normal
the
word
often
ends
in
-megaly
hepatomegaly
-enlarged
liver
splenomegaly
-
enlarged
spleen
or
both
hepatosplenomegaly
when
these
organs
become
enlarged
it
may
cause
pain
in
the
right
upper
quadrant
of
the
abdomen
complications
are
problems
that
happen
because
of
a
disease
pregnant
women
and
young
children
have
more
complications
people
who
get
malaria
for
the
first
time
have
more
complications
falciparum
malaria
has
the
most
complications
a
clinical
diagnosis
is
based
on
the
signs
and
symptoms
of
a
disease
it
is
a
diagnosis
made
without
medical
testing
in
the
case
of
malaria
one
of
the
main
symptoms
which
may
lead
to
a
clinical
diagnosis
of
malaria
is
a
fever
any
clinical
diagnosis
of
malaria
should
be
confirmed
by
a
trained
professional
based
upon
laboratory
results
as
soon
as
it
is
possible
a
malaria
rapid
diagnostic
test
is
a
blood
test
which
can
confirm
a
diagnosis
of
malaria
in
about
twenty
minutes
rdts
are
not
foolproof
and
have
a
number
of
drawbacks
and
as
such
a
negative
rapid
diagnostic
test
should
not
be
accepted
at
face-value
and
follow-up
with
malaria
microscopy
is
necessary
to
see
if
patients
have
malaria
doctors
may
do
a
blood
test
this
test
is
called
a
giemsa
blood
smear
blood
is
put
on
a
slide
which
is
a
thin
piece
of
glass
the
giemsa
stain
is
put
on
the
slide
this
stain
helps
doctors
see
the
malaria
then
they
look
at
the
slide
under
a
microscope
the
plasmodium
is
seen
in
the
red
blood
cells
people
with
different
kinds
of
malaria
need
different
medicines
the
medicine
that
works
for
one
kind
of
malaria
may
not
for
another
kind
so
it
is
very
important
to
know
which
species
of
plasmodium
the
person
has
if
the
species
is
not
known
the
person
should
be
given
medicine
and
care
like
they
have
falciparum
malaria
–
the
worst
kind
it
is
also
important
to
know
where
the
person
got
malaria
plasmodium
in
some
places
is
resistant
to
some
medicines
so
the
medicines
to
treat
malaria
in
africa
are
different
from
the
medicines
to
treat
malaria
from
south
america
everywhere
except
new
guinea
the
treatment
is
the
same
in
new
guinea
most
p
vivax
is
resistant
to
chloroquine
it
can
be
treated
with
quinine
but
this
medicine
can
make
people
sick
everywhere
else
non-falciparum
malaria
is
treated
with
chloroquine
chloroquine
kills
the
plasmodium
in
the
blood
but
the
plasmodium
in
the
liver
is
not
killed
by
chloroquine
p
vivax
and
p
ovale
both
stay
in
the
liver
a
long
time
this
is
the
dormant
phase
another
medicine
must
be
given
with
chloroquine
for
p
vivax
and
p
ovale
this
is
to
kill
the
plasmodium
in
the
liver
the
medicine
used
to
kill
malaria
in
the
liver
is
primaquine
in
southeast
asia
some
p
vivax
is
resistant
to
primaquine
most
other
places
primaquine
works
very
well
some
people
get
very
sick
from
primaquine
so
people
have
to
be
tested
to
see
if
they
have
gpd-deficiency
before
they
take
primaquine
falciparum
is
the
worst
kind
of
malaria
people
with
falciparum
malaria
should
be
treated
in
a
hospital
if
they
are:
very
sick
children
pregnant
having
malaria
for
the
first
time
not
able
to
take
medicines
by
moutheven
people
who
are
treated
with
medicines
at
home
should
stay
with
the
doctor
for
hours
this
is
to
make
sure
they
do
not
get
sicker
it
also
makes
sure
they
can
take
the
medicines
by
mouth
malaria
does
not
start
to
become
a
life-threatening
disease
until
it
has
been
a
couple
of
weeks
after
the
bite
without
being
treated
falciparum
malaria
also
has
more
resistance
to
medicines
this
makes
it
much
harder
to
treat
falciparum
malaria
is
always
treated
with
two
or
more
medicines
doctors
choose
the
medicines
by
where
in
the
world
the
person
got
malaria
different
places
have
p
falciparum
that
is
resistant
to
different
medicines
the
most
important
resistance
is
chloroquine-resistance
in
some
places
in
the
world
p
falciparum
is
killed
by
chloroquine
in
some
places
it
is
chloroquine-resistant
this
means
chloroquine
does
not
kill
it
in
these
places
quinine
can
be
used
quinine
is
taken
by
mouth
there
are
three
ways
to
prevent
malaria:
control
mosquitoes
keep
mosquitoes
from
biting
take
medicine
to
keep
from
getting
sick
after
a
bite
especially
in
those
parts
of
the
world
where
people
get
malaria
vector
control
is
one
way
to
stop
malaria
vector
means
an
organism
that
carries
an
infectious
disease
to
another
organism
for
malaria
the
vector
is
the
anopheles
mosquito
the
most
used
method
of
vector
control
is
pesticides
these
are
chemicals
that
kill
the
mosquito
the
first
pesticide
used
for
vector
control
was
ddt
ddt
worked
very
well
for
vector
control
it
killed
mosquitoes
it
did
not
make
people
very
sick
at
the
time
it
was
used
it
did
not
cost
very
much
money
other
chemicals
for
vector
control
had
not
been
invented
yet
in
many
places
mosquitoes
became
resistant
to
ddt
this
meant
that
ddt
did
not
work
anymore
in
these
areas
scientists
worried
that
ddt
was
making
people
and
animals
sick
it
killed
a
lot
of
wildlife
too
ddt
also
stays
in
the
environment
for
a
long
time
for
these
reasons
people
mostly
use
other
chemicals
for
vector
control
organophosphate
or
carbonate
pesticides
are
used
like
malathion
or
bendiocarb
vector
control
is
not
the
only
way
to
stop
malaria
and
ddt
is
not
the
only
chemical
that
can
be
used
for
vector
control
the
best
way
to
stop
malaria
is
to
use
a
combination
of
methods
in
some
places
ddt
may
be
a
useful
part
of
a
program
to
stop
malaria
this
is
why
ddt
is
still
allowed
to
be
used
for
controlling
malaria
the
mosquito
that
carries
malaria
comes
more
at
dawn
when
the
sun
comes
up
and
dusk
when
the
sun
goes
down
be
most
careful
at
these
times
wear
long
trousers
and
shirts
with
long
sleeves
wear
mosquito
repellent
this
is
a
chemical
that
mosquitoes
do
not
like
so
they
do
not
bite
mosquitoes
will
bite
through
thin
cloth
so
repellent
should
be
used
on
skin
and
clothes
pesticides
can
be
used
in
rooms
to
kill
mosquitoes
when
sleeping
outside
people
use
a
mosquito
net
this
is
made
from
cloth
that
air
can
go
through
but
keeps
mosquitoes
out
it
is
put
over
a
bed
where
people
sleep
to
keep
mosquitoes
out
sometimes
people
also
use
it
when
they
are
not
sleeping
it
is
best
to
use
mosquito
nets
that
have
been
treated
with
permethrin
which
repels
and
kills
mosquitoes
people
can
take
medicine
when
they
are
in
a
place
where
there
is
malaria
this
reduces
the
chances
that
they
contract
malaria
this
is
called
prophylaxis
some
people
take
prophylactic
medicines
for
years
many
people
in
areas
where
there
is
malaria
do
not
have
the
money
to
buy
this
medicine
people
who
live
where
there
is
no
malaria
usually
have
not
had
malaria
the
first
case
malaria
is
usually
much
worse
so
people
from
places
where
there
is
no
malaria
may
take
prophylactic
medicines
when
they
go
to
places
where
there
is
malaria
the
kind
of
prophylactic
medicines
people
take
depends
on
where
they
are
this
is
because
not
all
medicines
work
on
the
malaria
in
every
place
to
make
them
work
best
prophylactic
medicines
have
to
be
taken
the
right
way
the
medicine
should
start
before
going
to
an
area
with
malaria
most
medicines
should
be
taken
for
weeks
after
coming
home
one
medicine
malarone
only
needs
to
be
used
for
one
week
after
coming
home
there
are
some
children
in
tanzania
who
are
naturally
immune
to
malaria
researchers
are
using
this
to
develop
a
new
vaccine
researchers
have
found
the
children
produce
an
antibody
which
attacks
the
malaria-causing
parasite
injecting
a
form
of
this
antibody
into
mice
protected
the
animals
from
the
disease
the
researchers
plan
to
do
tests
on
primates
including
humans
it
was
britain's
sir
ronald
ross
working
in
the
presidency
general
hospital
in
the
kolkata
who
finally
proved
in
that
malaria
is
transmitted
by
mosquitoes
he
did
this
by
showing
that
certain
mosquito
species
transmit
malaria
to
birds
he
isolated
malaria
parasites
from
the
salivary
glands
of
mosquitoes
that
had
fed
on
infected
birds
for
this
work
ross
received
the
nobel
prize
in
medicine
after
resigning
from
the
indian
medical
service
ross
worked
at
the
newly
established
liverpool
school
of
tropical
medicine
and
directed
malaria-control
efforts
in
egypt
panama
greece
and
mauritius
the
findings
of
finlay
and
ross
were
later
confirmed
by
a
medical
board
headed
by
walter
reed
in
its
recommendations
were
used
during
construction
of
the
panama
canal
this
public-health
work
saved
the
lives
of
thousands
of
workers
and
helped
develop
the
methods
used
in
future
public-health
campaigns
against
the
disease
the
first
effective
treatment
for
malaria
came
from
the
bark
of
cinchona
tree
which
contains
quinine
this
tree
grows
on
the
slopes
of
the
andes
mainly
in
peru
the
indigenous
peoples
of
peru
made
a
tincture
of
cinchona
to
control
malaria
the
jesuits
noted
the
efficacy
of
the
practice
and
introduced
the
treatment
to
europe
during
the
where
it
was
rapidly
accepted
it
was
not
until
that
the
active
ingredient
quinine
was
extracted
from
the
bark
isolated
and
named
by
french
chemists
in
the
early
th
century
before
antibiotics
became
available
julius
wagner-jauregg
discovered
that
patients
with
syphilis
could
be
treated
by
intentionally
infecting
them
with
malaria
the
resulting
fever
would
kill
the
syphilis
spirochaetes
and
quinine
could
be
administered
to
control
the
malaria
although
some
patients
died
from
malaria
this
was
preferable
to
the
almost-certain
death
from
syphilis
malaria
was
the
largest
hazard
encountered
by
troops
in
the
south
pacific
during
world
war
ii
where
about
men
were
infected
sixty
thousand
american
soldiers
died
of
malaria
during
the
north
african
and
south
pacific
campaigns

physical
fitness
refers
to
good
body
health
it
is
dependent
on
genetic
determinators
and
also
on
social
economic
and
ecological
factors
that
means
one´s
genes
are
partly
responsible
for
one´s
physical
health
but
also
other
circumstances:
where
you
live
how
clean
or
polluted
your
water
and
the
air
around
you
is
and
also
how
good
your
social
and
medical
system
is
it
is
also
the
result
of
regular
exercise
proper
diet
and
nutrition
and
proper
rest
for
physical
recovery
a
person
who
is
physically
fit
will
be
able
to
walk
or
run
without
getting
breathless
and
they
will
be
able
to
carry
out
the
activities
of
everyday
living
and
not
need
help
how
much
each
person
can
do
will
depend
on
their
age
and
whether
they
are
a
man
or
woman
a
physically
fit
person
usually
has
a
normal
weight
for
their
height
the
relation
between
their
height
and
weight
is
called
their
body
mass
index
a
taller
person
can
be
heavier
and
still
be
fit
if
a
person
is
too
heavy
or
too
thin
for
their
height
it
may
affect
their
health
mental
health
refers
to
a
person's
emotional
and
psychological
well-being
a
state
of
emotional
and
psychological
well-being
in
which
an
individual
is
able
to
use
his
or
her
thinking
and
emotional
feeling
abilities
function
in
society
and
meet
the
ordinary
demands
of
everyday
life
one
way
to
think
about
mental
health
is
by
looking
at
how
well
a
person
functions
feeling
capable
and
efficient
being
able
to
handle
normal
levels
of
stress
have
good
friends
and
family
and
lead
an
independent
life
and
being
able
to
bounce
back
or
recover
from
hardships
are
all
signs
of
mental
health
public
health
refers
to
trying
to
stop
a
disease
that
is
unhealthy
to
the
community
and
does
not
help
in
long
life
or
promote
your
health
this
is
fixed
by
organized
efforts
and
choices
of
society
public
and
private
clubs
communities
and
individuals
it
is
about
the
health
of
many
people
or
everybody
rather
than
one
person
public
health
stops
instead
of
encouraging
a
disease
through
surveillance
of
cases
to
prevent
being
sick
it
is
good
to
act
according
to
some
simple
advice:
hand
washing
regular
check-ups
vaccination
programmes
drinking
clean
water
and
using
condoms
when
infectious
diseases
break
out
washing
hands
for
about
seconds
may
be
especially
important
sometimes
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
masses
of
people
or
wear
a
surgical
mask
to
protect
yourself
and
to
stop
the
spreading
of
the
disease
teaching
people
how
to
live
healthily
and
educate
them
especially
about
sex
and
child-birth
is
also
very
important

insects
have
exoskeletons
skeletons
on
the
outside
their
skeletons
are
made
out
of
thin
hard
pieces
or
plates
like
armour
made
of
chitin
all
together
these
pieces
make
a
hard
layer
around
the
insect’s
body
the
exoskeleton
protects
the
insect
the
body
of
an
insect
has
three
main
parts:
a
head
a
thorax
and
an
abdomen
on
the
head
are
an
insect’s
compound
eyes
its
two
antennae
they
feel
and
smell
things
and
its
mouth
on
the
thorax
insects
have
wings
and
legs
all
insects
have
six
legs
three
pairs
of
jointed
legs
and
usually
four
wings
two
pairs
the
abdomen
is
the
back
part
of
the
insect
inside
the
abdomen
is
the
stomach
the
heart
and
the
excretory
system
where
body
wastes
pass
out
of
the
insect
bees
also
have
a
stinger
at
the
back
of
the
abdomen
just
like
our
muscles
connect
to
our
bones
to
make
us
walk
and
stand
up
the
muscles
of
an
insect
connect
to
the
exoskeleton
to
make
it
walk
and
move
their
muscles
are
on
the
inside
of
their
skeleton
insects
are
cold-blooded
which
means
that
they
cannot
control
their
body
temperature
this
means
that
insects
are
not
good
at
surviving
the
cold
at
any
rate
out
in
the
open
in
the
winter
many
insects
go
into
something
called
diapause
which
is
the
insect
version
of
hibernation
some
insects
like
cockroaches
cannot
go
into
diapause
and
they
will
die
if
it
gets
too
cold
outside
this
is
why
cockroaches
love
living
in
people's
warm
houses
insect
respiration
happens
without
lungs
there
is
a
system
of
internal
tubes
and
sacs
through
which
gases
diffuse
or
are
actively
pumped
air
is
taken
in
through
openings
on
the
sides
of
the
abdomen
called
spiracles
oxygen
gets
to
tissues
that
need
it
through
their
trachea
element
in
diagram
many
insect
larvae
live
in
water
many
of
those
have
gills
that
can
extract
oxygen
dissolved
in
water
others
must
rise
to
the
water
surface
to
get
air
which
may
be
held
or
trapped
in
special
parts
of
their
body
adult
insects
use
oxygen
at
a
high
rate
when
they
fly
they
need
it
for
the
flight
muscles
the
most
active
tissue
known
in
biology
the
flight
muscles
use
oxygen
at
a
huge
rate:
ccs
of
oxygen
for
every
single
cc
of
tissue
per
hour
with
this
system
the
greatest
diameter
a
muscle
could
have
and
still
consume
oxygen
at
this
rate
is
about
cm
even
with
special
extra
arrangements
insects
cannot
get
larger
than
about
cm
long
the
largest
insect
bodies
are
about
as
big
as
a
mouse
some
insects
also
use
a
molecule
called
haemocyanin
which
does
the
same
job
as
haemoglobin
does
in
vertebrates
but
less
efficiently
the
insect
circulatory
system
has
no
veins
or
arteries
the
'blood'
is
called
haemolymph
and
moves
around
in
the
space
called
the
haemocoel
the
organs
sit
in
the
haemocoel
and
are
bathed
in
the
haemolymph
the
'heart'
is
little
more
than
a
single
tube
which
pulses
squeezes
insects
start
life
as
an
egg
usually
a
female
mother
insect
lays
eggs
but
a
few
species
have
live
birth
the
eggs
develop
inside
the
mother
the
eggs
are
small
but
they
can
usually
be
seen
with
the
naked
eye
although
the
adults
are
larger
they
do
need
a
magnifying
glass
or
a
binocular
microscope
to
see
the
details
a
professional
entomologist
uses
a
binocular
microscope
to
identify
insects
plus
a
printed
reference
work
there
are
far
too
many
insects
for
anyone
to
remember
them
all
and
most
entomologists
specialise
in
just
one
or
two
orders
after
the
eggs
hatch
two
kinds
of
development
may
occur
some
insects
have
what
is
called
'incomplete
metamorphosis'
this
means
that
a
small
insect
called
a
nymph
comes
out
of
the
egg
and
the
nymph
looks
almost
the
same
as
the
adult
insect
as
the
nymph
grows
it
does
not
change
the
way
it
looks
but
only
how
big
it
is
it
goes
through
a
number
of
stages
called
'instars'
grasshoppers
grow
in
this
way
other
insects
have
complete
metamorphosis
which
means
that
the
small
larva
which
comes
out
of
the
egg
looks
very
different
from
the
adult
insect
insects
that
have
complete
metamorphosis
usually
come
out
of
the
egg
as
a
larva
which
usually
looks
like
a
worm
the
larva
eats
food
and
gets
bigger
until
it
turns
into
a
pupa
butterfly
pupae
plural
for
pupa
are
often
inside
cocoons
inside
the
cocoon
the
insect
changes
the
way
it
looks
and
often
grows
wings
when
the
cocoon
opens
the
adult
insect
comes
out
many
insects
have
complete
metamorphosis
for
example
beetles
butterflies
and
moths
and
flies
the
adult
stage
of
development
is
called
the
imago
the
oldest
known
insect
fossil
is
the
devonian
rhyniognatha
from
the
million
year
old
rhynie
chert
it
may
have
superficially
resembled
a
modern-day
silverfish
insect
this
species
already
possessed
mandibles
of
a
type
associated
with
winged
insects
suggesting
that
wings
may
already
have
evolved
at
this
time
thus
the
first
insects
probably
appeared
earlier
in
the
silurian
period
in
researchers
uncovered
what
they
believe
is
the
world's
oldest
known
full-body
impression
of
a
primitive
flying
insect
a
million-year-old
specimen
from
the
carboniferous
period
the
origins
of
insect
flight
remain
obscure
since
the
earliest
winged
insects
currently
known
appear
to
have
been
capable
fliers
some
extinct
insects
had
an
additional
pair
of
winglets
attaching
to
the
first
segment
of
the
thorax
for
a
total
of
three
pairs
it
seems
the
insects
were
not
a
particularly
successful
group
of
animals
before
they
evolved
wings
upper
carboniferous
and
lower
permian
insect
orders
include
both
living
groups
and
a
number
of
palaeozoic
groups
now
extinct
during
this
era
some
giant
dragonfly-like
forms
reached
wingspans
of
to
cm
to
in
making
them
far
larger
than
any
living
insect
this
gigantism
may
have
been
due
to
higher
atmospheric
oxygen
levels
which
allowed
increased
respiratory
efficiency
the
lack
of
flying
vertebrates
could
have
been
another
factor
many
of
the
early
groups
became
extinct
during
the
permian-triassic
extinction
event
the
largest
mass
extinction
in
the
history
of
the
earth
around
million
years
ago
different
kinds
of
insects
can
be
divided
into
groups
called
orders
there
are
many
insect
orders
the
biggest
insect
orders
are
listed
below:
beetles
order
coleoptera
have
the
front
pair
of
wings
changed
into
a
hard
shell
to
protect
the
back
wings
butterflies
and
moths
order
lepidoptera
have
large
often
colourful
wings
flies
order
diptera
have
only
two
wings
ants
bees
and
wasps
order
hymenoptera
sometimes
have
stingers
and
sometimes
live
in
large
colonies
like
ant
hills
true
bugs
order
hemiptera
have
a
mouth
that
is
long
and
narrow
like
a
drinking
straw
this
kind
of
mouth
is
called
a
beak
grasshoppers
order
orthoptera
can
usually
jump
with
their
legs
eat
grass
and
grain
plants
odonata
dragonflies
and
damselflies
are
top
predators
of
other
insects
both
aquatic
nymphs
and
flying
adults
are
carnivorous
phasmatodea
the
stick
and
leaf
insects
is
an
order
which
is
entirely
based
on
camouflage
it
includes
the
world's
longest
insect
chan's
megastick
spiders
scorpions
and
similar
animals
are
not
insects
they
are
arachnids
arachnids
are
arthropods
that
have
four
pairs
of
legs
centipedes
are
also
arthropods
but
not
insects:
they
are
in
a
subphylum
called
the
myriapoda
this
taxonomy
lists
some
of
the
better
known
groups
of
insects
archaeognatha

pests
can
be
harmful
to
people
in
different
ways
some
are
parasites
such
as
lice
and
bed
bugs
some
of
these
parasite
insects
can
spread
diseases
such
as
mosquitoes
spreading
malaria
other
pest
insects
do
not
directly
hurt
people
termites
and
some
beetles
eat
wood
and
sometimes
eat
buildings
such
as
houses
however
termites
also
help
break
down
the
trees
and
branches
that
fall
on
the
forest
floor
many
insects
eat
agricultural
products
plants
meant
for
people
to
eat
grasshoppers
are
one
example
of
pest
insects
that
eat
plants
in
agriculture
some
insects
are
useful
to
us
bees
make
honey
the
larvae
of
some
moths
make
silk
which
people
use
to
make
clothing
in
some
parts
of
the
world
people
actually
eat
insects
eating
insects
for
food
is
called
entomophagy
many
bees
and
flies
pollinate
plants
this
means
the
insects
help
the
plants
make
seeds
by
moving
pollen
from
one
flower
to
another
some
good
insects
eat
pest
insects
such
as
lady
beetles
or
ladybirds
or
ladybugs
eating
aphids
many
insects
eat
dead
plants
and
animals
people
often
use
poisons
called
insecticides
to
kill
pest
insects
insecticides
do
not
always
work
sometimes
the
pest
insects
become
resistant
to
the
insecticides
which
means
the
insecticides
do
not
hurt
them
anymore
both
the
colorado
potato
beetle
and
the
diamondback
moth
are
insects
that
are
resistant
to
many
insecticides
insecticides
do
not
only
kill
pest
insects
sometimes
many
helpful
insects
are
killed
too
when
helpful
insects
are
killed
such
as
those
that
eat
pest
insects
the
pest
insects
may
come
back
in
larger
numbers
than
before
because
they
are
not
being
eaten
by
helpful
insects
anymore
birds
come
in
a
huge
range
of
colours
these
colours
can
be
useful
to
a
bird
in
two
ways
camouflage
colours
help
to
hide
the
bird
and
bright
colours
identify
the
bird
to
others
of
the
same
species
often
the
male
is
brightly
coloured
while
the
female
is
camouflaged
many
birds
are
brown
green
or
grey
these
colours
make
a
bird
harder
to
see
they
camouflage
the
bird
brown
is
the
most
common
colour
brown
birds
include
sparrows
emus
thrushes
larks
eagles
falcons
and
the
female
birds
of
many
species
such
as
wrens
ducks
blackbirds
and
peacocks
when
a
brown
bird
is
in
long
grass
or
among
tree
trunks
or
rocks
it
is
camouflaged
birds
that
live
in
long
grass
often
have
brown
feathers
streaked
with
black
which
looks
like
shadows
a
bittern
is
almost
invisible
in
long
reeds
other
birds
including
starlings
and
minahs
are
quite
dark
in
colour
but
are
flecked
with
little
spots
that
look
like
raindrops
on
leaves
many
birds
from
hot
countries
are
green
or
have
some
green
feathers
particularly
parrots
birds
that
live
in
green
trees
often
have
green
backs
even
if
they
have
bright-coloured
breasts
from
the
back
the
birds
are
camouflaged
this
is
very
useful
when
sitting
on
a
nest
the
bird's
bright-coloured
breast
is
hidden
budgerigars
are
bred
in
different
colours
such
as
blue
white
and
mauve
but
in
the
wild
they
are
nearly
all
green
and
yellow
even
though
they
fly
very
well
they
normally
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
the
ground
eating
grass
seeds
their
yellow
and
black
striped
back
helps
to
hide
them
in
the
shadows
made
by
long
dry
grass
while
their
green
breasts
are
a
similar
colour
to
the
leaves
of
gum
trees
grey
birds
include
most
pigeons
and
doves
cranes
storks
and
herons
grey
birds
are
often
rock-living
birds
like
pigeons
or
birds
that
sit
on
dead
tree
trunks
looking
like
a
broken
branch
water
birds
like
herons
often
have
a
pale
grey
colour
which
makes
it
harder
for
a
fish
to
notice
that
the
bird
is
standing
looking
down
for
something
to
catch
water
birds
no
matter
what
colour
they
are
on
top
are
often
white
underneath
so
that
when
a
fish
looks
up
the
bird
looks
like
part
of
the
sky
black
birds
include
crows
ravens
and
male
blackbirds
some
birds
that
are
dark
colours
spend
quite
a
lot
of
time
on
the
ground
hopping
around
in
the
shadows
under
bushes
among
these
birds
are
the
male
blackbird
and
the
satin
bowerbird
which
is
not
black
but
very
dark
blue
crows
and
ravens
often
perch
high
on
bare
trees
in
the
winter
where
their
black
shape
against
the
sky
looks
like
the
dark
bare
branches
many
birds
are
not
camouflaged
but
stand
out
with
vivid
colours
they
are
usually
male
birds
whose
females
are
dull
and
camouflaged
the
function
of
the
colours
is
two-fold
first
the
colours
help
them
get
mates
and
second
the
colours
identify
them
to
other
males
of
the
same
species
many
birds
are
territorial
especially
in
the
nesting
season
they
give
out
territory
sounds
and
are
easily
seen
this
lets
other
males
know
they
will
defend
their
territory
it
sends
out
a
look
elsewhere
signal
to
their
competitors
some
birds
are
famous
for
their
colour
and
are
named
for
it
such
as
the
bluebird
the
azure
kingfisher
the
golden
pheasant
the
scarlet
macaw
the
violet
wren
and
the
robin
many
other
birds
are
very
brightly
coloured
in
countless
combinations
some
of
the
most
colourful
birds
are
quite
common
like
pheasants
peacocks
domestic
fowl
and
parrots
colourful
small
birds
include
blue
tits
the
gold
finches
humming
birds
fairy
wrens
and
bee
eaters
which
are
also
called
rainbow
birds
some
birds
like
those
of
the
bird
of
paradise
in
papua
new
guinea
have
such
beautiful
feathers
that
they
have
been
hunted
for
them
the
peafowl
is
the
best
example
of
a
display
of
colour
to
attract
a
mate
also
the
male
domestic
fowl
and
junglefowl
have
long
shiny
feathers
above
his
tail
and
also
long
neck
feathers
that
may
be
a
different
colour
to
his
wings
and
body
there
are
only
a
very
few
types
of
birds
like
the
eclectus
parrot
where
the
female
is
more
colourful
than
the
male
'pied
birds'
are
black
and
white
black
and
white
birds
include
magpies
pied
geese
pelicans
and
australian
magpies
which
are
not
really
magpies
at
all
pied
birds
often
have
brightly
coloured
beaks
and
legs
of
yellow
or
red
the
silver
pheasant
with
its
long
white
tail
striped
with
fine
bars
of
black
has
a
brightly
coloured
face
most
birds
can
fly
they
do
this
by
pushing
through
the
air
with
their
wings
the
curved
surfaces
of
the
wings
cause
air
currents
wind
which
lift
the
bird
flapping
keeps
the
air
current
moving
to
create
lift
and
also
moves
the
bird
forward
some
birds
can
glide
on
air
currents
without
flapping
many
birds
use
this
method
when
they
are
about
to
land
some
birds
can
also
hover
and
remain
in
one
place
this
method
is
used
by
birds
of
prey
such
as
falcons
that
are
looking
for
something
to
eat
seagulls
are
also
good
at
hovering
particularly
if
there
is
a
strong
breeze
the
most
expert
hovering
birds
are
tiny
hummingbirds
which
can
beat
their
wings
both
backwards
and
forwards
and
can
stay
quite
still
in
the
air
while
they
dip
their
long
beaks
into
flowers
to
feed
on
the
sweet
nectar
different
types
of
birds
have
different
needs
their
wings
are
adapted
to
suit
the
way
they
fly
large
birds
of
prey
such
as
eagles
that
spend
a
lot
of
time
soaring
on
the
wind
have
wings
that
are
large
and
broad
the
main
flight
feathers
are
long
and
wide
they
help
the
eagle
to
stay
on
rising
air
currents
without
using
much
energy
while
the
eagle
looks
at
the
ground
below
to
find
the
next
meal
when
the
eagle
sees
some
small
creature
move
it
can
close
its
wings
and
fall
from
the
sky
like
a
missile
opening
its
great
wings
again
to
slow
down
as
it
comes
to
land
the
world's
largest
eagle
the
philippine
eagle
has
a
wingspan
of
about
metres
ft
wide
birds
that
live
in
grassland
areas
or
open
forests
and
feed
on
fruit
insects
and
reptiles
often
spend
a
lot
of
time
flying
short
journeys
looking
for
food
and
water
they
have
wings
that
are
shaped
in
a
similar
way
to
eagles
but
rounder
and
not
as
good
for
soaring
these
include
many
australian
birds
like
cockatoos
birds
such
as
geese
that
migrate
from
one
country
to
another
fly
very
long
distances
their
wings
are
big
and
strong
because
the
birds
are
large
and
they
stock
up
on
food
for
the
long
flight
migrating
water
birds
usually
form
family
groups
of
-
birds
they
fly
very
high
making
use
of
long
streams
of
air
that
blow
from
north
to
south
in
different
seasons
they
are
very
well
organised
often
flying
in
a
v
pattern
the
geese
at
the
back
do
not
have
to
flap
so
hard
they
are
pulled
on
by
the
wind
of
the
ones
at
the
front
every
so
often
they
change
the
leader
so
that
the
front
bird
who
does
most
work
and
sets
the
pace
can
have
a
rest
geese
and
swans
are
the
highest-flying
birds
reaching
metres
or
more
when
on
migration
geese
often
honk
loudly
while
they
are
flying
it
is
thought
that
they
do
this
to
support
the
leader
and
help
the
young
ones
birds
that
fly
very
quickly
such
as
swifts
and
swallows
have
long
narrow
pointed
wings
these
birds
need
great
speed
because
they
eat
insects
catching
most
of
them
while
they
are
flying
these
birds
also
migrate
they
often
collect
in
huge
flocks
of
thousands
of
birds
that
move
together
like
a
whirling
cloud
birds
that
live
in
bushes
and
branches
have
triangular
wings
that
help
the
bird
change
direction
many
forest
birds
are
expert
at
getting
up
speed
by
flapping
and
then
gliding
steadily
among
the
trees
tilting
to
avoid
things
as
they
go
members
of
the
kingfisher
family
are
expert
at
this
type
of
flying
birds
such
as
owls
that
hunt
at
night
have
wings
with
soft
rounded
feathers
so
that
they
do
not
flap
loudly
birds
that
are
awake
at
night
are
called
nocturnal
birds
birds
that
are
awake
during
the
day
are
diurnal
a
wandering
albatross
and
arctic
tern
might
spend
several
years
without
coming
to
land
they
can
sleep
while
gliding
and
have
wings
which
when
they
are
stretched
right
out
look
like
the
wings
of
a
jet
plane
bird
like
chickens
that
feed
mainly
on
the
ground
and
only
use
their
wings
to
fly
to
safety
have
small
wings
flocks
of
birds
can
be
very
highly
organised
in
a
way
that
takes
care
of
all
the
flock
members
studies
of
small
flocking
birds
like
tree
sparrows
show
that
they
clearly
communicate
with
each
other
as
sometimes
thousands
of
birds
may
fly
in
close
formation
and
spiral
patterns
without
colliding
or
flying
into
each
other
two
common
behaviours
in
flocking
birds
are
guarding
and
reconnaissance
when
a
flock
of
birds
is
feeding
it
is
common
for
one
bird
to
perch
on
a
high
place
to
keep
guard
over
the
flock
in
the
same
way
when
a
flock
is
asleep
often
one
bird
will
remain
awake
it
is
also
common
for
large
flocks
to
send
one
or
two
birds
ahead
of
them
when
they
are
flying
to
a
new
area
the
look-out
birds
can
spy
the
lie
of
the
land
to
find
food
water
and
good
places
to
perch
some
birds
do
not
fly
these
include
running
birds
like
ostriches
and
emus
and
ocean-living
birds
the
large
penguin
family
ostriches
and
emus
do
not
need
to
fly
because
although
they
feed
and
nest
on
the
ground
their
great
size
and
their
speed
is
their
protection
some
other
ground-feeding
birds
have
not
been
so
lucky
some
birds
such
as
the
dodo
and
the
kiwi
were
ground-feeding
birds
that
lived
in
safety
on
islands
where
there
was
nothing
dangerous
to
eat
them
they
lost
the
power
of
flight
kiwis
are
endangered
because
european
settlement
to
new
zealand
brought
animals
like
cats
dogs
and
rats
which
kill
kiwis
and
eat
their
eggs
however
kiwis
and
also
the
rare
new
zealand
ground
parrot
have
survived
in
the
case
of
dodos
they
were
fat
and
delicious
they
were
killed
and
eaten
by
sailors
until
there
was
none
left
other
flightless
birds
which
have
disappeared
are
the
great
auk
and
the
moa
penguins
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
at
sea
where
they
are
in
danger
from
seals
on
land
they
usually
live
in
areas
where
there
were
few
dangers
until
the
arrival
of
european
settlers
with
dogs
and
cats
their
wings
have
adapted
to
life
in
the
sea
and
have
become
flippers
which
help
them
in
swimming
very
fast
modern
birds
do
not
have
teeth
but
they
must
nevertheless
break
up
food
before
it
is
digested
first
of
all
along
their
throat
oesophagus
they
have
a
crop
this
stores
food
items
before
digestion
that
way
a
bird
can
eat
several
items
and
then
fly
off
to
a
quiet
spot
to
digest
them
their
stomach
comes
next
with
two
very
different
parts
one
part
is
like
a
straight
hollow
rod
which
secretes
mild
hydrochloric
acid
and
an
enzyme
to
break
down
protein
the
other
part
of
the
stomach
is
the
gizzard
this
is
muscular
and
grinds
up
the
contents
in
herbivorous
birds
the
gizzard
contains
some
gastroliths
small
stones
or
pieces
of
grit
bones
of
fish
will
mostly
be
dissolved
by
the
stomach
acid
the
partly
digested
and
ground-up
food
now
goes
to
the
intestine
where
digestion
is
completed
and
then
most
contents
are
absorbed
anything
indigestible
for
example
remains
of
feathers
is
regurgitated
via
the
mouth
not
the
cloaca
the
system
is
effective
and
carnivorous
birds
can
swallow
quite
large
prey
a
blue
heron
can
swallow
a
fish
as
large
as
a
carp
successfully
raptors
eat
by
holding
the
prey
down
and
tearing
it
apart
with
their
beak
although
birds
are
warm-blooded
creatures
like
mammals
they
do
not
give
birth
to
live
young
they
lay
eggs
as
reptiles
do
but
the
shell
of
a
bird's
egg
is
hard
the
baby
bird
grows
inside
the
egg
and
after
a
few
weeks
hatches
breaks
out
of
the
egg
birds
in
cold
climates
usually
have
a
breeding
season
once
a
year
in
the
spring
migratory
birds
can
have
two
springs
and
two
mating
seasons
in
a
year
so
can
birds
that
live
in
hot
climates
when
the
breeding
season
arrives
the
birds
choose
partners
some
birds
are
mated
for
life
like
married
couples
these
birds
include
pigeons
geese
and
cranes
other
birds
look
for
new
partners
each
year
and
sometimes
a
male
bird
or
cock
will
have
several
wives
for
birds
that
choose
new
mates
part
of
the
breeding
season
is
display
the
male
bird
will
do
all
sorts
of
things
to
attract
females
these
include
singing
dancing
showing
off
the
feathers
and
building
a
beautiful
nest
some
male
birds
have
splendid
feathers
for
attracting
females
the
most
famous
is
the
peacock
who
can
spread
the
feathers
above
his
tail
into
a
huge
fan
once
the
birds
have
found
partners
they
find
a
suitable
place
to
lay
eggs
the
idea
of
what
is
a
suitable
place
differs
between
species
but
most
build
bird
nests
robins
will
make
a
beautiful
little
round
nest
of
woven
grass
and
carefully
line
it
with
feathers
bits
of
fluff
and
other
soft
things
swallows
like
to
nest
near
other
swallows
they
make
nests
from
little
blobs
of
clay
often
on
a
beam
near
the
roof
of
a
building
where
it
is
well
sheltered
many
birds
like
a
hollow
tree
to
nest
in
eagle's
nests
are
often
just
piles
of
dead
wood
on
the
top
of
the
tallest
tree
or
mountain
scrub
turkeys
scratch
together
a
huge
pile
of
leaves
that
may
be
metres
across
guillemots
lay
their
eggs
on
rock
shelves
with
no
nest
at
all
their
eggs
are
shaped
so
that
they
roll
around
in
circles
and
do
not
fall
off
cliffs
a
cuckoo
does
not
make
its
own
nest
it
lays
its
egg
in
the
nest
of
another
bird
and
leaves
it
for
them
to
care
for
the
cuckoo
eggs
are
camouflaged
to
look
like
the
host's
eggs
when
the
nest
has
been
prepared
the
birds
mate
so
that
the
eggs
are
fertilised
and
the
chicks
will
start
growing
unlike
mammals
birds
only
have
one
opening
as
the
exit
hole
for
body
fluids
and
for
reproduction
the
opening
is
called
the
cloaca
a
female
bird
called
a
hen
has
two
ovaries
of
which
the
left
one
usually
produces
eggs
most
male
birds
have
no
sex
organs
that
can
be
seen
but
inside
the
male
are
two
testes
which
produce
sperm
which
is
stored
in
the
cloaca
birds
mate
by
rubbing
their
cloacas
together
although
with
some
birds
particularly
large
water
birds
the
male
has
a
sort
of
a
penis
inside
the
cloaca
once
the
hen
has
mated
she
produces
fertile
eggs
which
have
chicks
growing
inside
them
she
lays
the
eggs
in
the
nest
there
might
be
just
one
egg
or
a
number
of
them
called
a
clutch
emus
might
lay
as
many
as
fifteen
huge
dark
green
eggs
in
a
clutch
after
the
eggs
are
laid
they
are
incubated
or
kept
warm
so
the
chicks
form
inside
most
birds
stay
together
for
the
whole
nesting
season
and
one
advantage
is
that
the
work
is
shared
many
birds
take
turns
sitting
on
the
eggs
so
that
each
adult
can
feed
this
is
not
always
the
case
with
emus
the
male
does
all
the
sitting
and
all
the
baby-minding
with
emperor
penguins
it
is
also
the
male
that
cares
for
the
egg
there
is
only
one
egg
which
he
keeps
on
his
feet
and
under
his
feathers
standing
in
a
big
group
of
males
without
feeding
until
the
chick
is
hatched
while
the
eggs
are
hatching
the
females
are
at
sea
feeding
so
that
they
can
care
for
the
chicks
when
they
return
some
birds
put
the
eggs
inside
or
on
top
of
the
mound
of
leaves
and
twigs
the
mound
acts
like
a
compost
heap
the
decomposition
of
the
rotting
leaves
causes
the
temperature
to
rise
this
is
heat
released
by
the
chemical
action
of
bacterial
and
fungal
respiration
it
is
the
same
reaction
as
that
which
keeps
mammals
and
birds
at
a
high
temperature
the
parents
leave
the
mound
when
the
chicks
hatch
they
are
able
to
feed
themselves
many
small
birds
take
–
weeks
to
hatch
eggs
albatrosses
take
days
during
this
time
the
female
loses
a
lot
of
her
body
weight
the
quickest
hatching
time
is
for
the
cuckoo
some
types
of
cuckoos
take
only
days
this
means
that
when
they
hatch
in
the
nest
of
their
'foster
parents'
the
eggs
that
the
parents
have
laid
are
not
yet
ready
newborn
cuckoos
are
naked
blind
and
ugly
but
they
are
strong
they
get
under
any
eggs
that
are
in
the
nest
and
throw
them
out
before
they
hatch
that
means
that
the
cuckoo
has
the
whole
care
of
both
parents
baby
cuckoos
grow
fast
and
often
get
bigger
than
the
parents
who
feed
them
when
baby
birds
hatch
in
most
types
of
birds
they
are
fed
by
both
parents
and
sometimes
by
older
aunties
as
well
their
mouths
are
open
all
the
time
and
are
often
very
brightly
coloured
which
acts
as
a
'releaser'
a
trigger
which
stimulates
the
parent
to
feed
them
for
birds
that
eat
grain
and
fruit
the
parents
eat
and
partly
digest
the
food
for
the
babies
it
is
then
vomitted
carefully
into
the
baby's
mouth
many
birds
particularly
those
that
mate
for
life
are
very
sociable
and
keep
together
in
a
family
group
which
might
be
anything
from
or
adult
birds
and
their
young
to
a
very
large
flock
as
chicks
grow
they
change
the
fluffy
down
that
covers
them
as
babies
for
real
feathers
at
this
stage
they
are
called
fledglings
other
family
members
may
help
care
for
fledgling
chicks
feeding
them
and
protecting
them
from
attack
while
parents
are
feeding
when
the
fledglings
have
their
new
feathers
they
come
out
of
the
nest
to
learn
to
fly
in
some
types
of
birds
like
pigeons
the
parents
watch
over
this
and
as
the
young
ones
get
stronger
will
give
them
flying
lessons
teaching
them
how
to
glide
how
to
fly
in
spirals
and
how
to
land
like
an
expert
most
birds
are
social
animals
at
least
part
of
the
time
they
communicate
to
each
other
using
sounds
and
displays
almost
all
birds
make
sounds
to
communicate
the
types
of
noises
that
vary
greatly
some
birds
can
sing
and
they
are
called
songbirds
or
passerines
examples
are
robins
larks
canaries
thrushes
nightingales
corvids
are
passerines
but
they
do
not
sing
birds
that
are
not
songbirds
include
pigeons
seagulls
eagles
owls
and
ducks
parrots
are
not
songbirds
even
though
they
can
be
taught
to
sing
human
songs
all
birds
make
noises
'bird
vocalisation'
but
not
all
sing
songbirds
are
passerines
many
of
which
have
beautiful
melodic
songs
songs
have
different
functions
danger
cries
are
different
from
territorial
songs
and
mating
calls
are
a
third
type
fledgling
may
also
have
different
calls
from
adults
recognition
calls
for
partners
are
quite
common
as
to
where
the
song
comes
from
there
are
three
kinds
of
species:
those
where
the
song
is
entirely
inherited
and
the
bird
always
sings
the
same
song
in
the
same
situations
those
where
the
song
is
partly
inherited
but
the
bird
tunes
it
in
by
copying
others
in
this
case
the
slight
differences
between
the
calls
of
different
birds
may
be
used
by
partners
for
identification
those
where
the
song
is
entirely
learnt
and
the
bird
often
copies
sounds
from
its
environment
most
singing
birds
that
are
kept
as
pets
like
canaries
have
several
tunes
and
some
variations
the
same
species
of
bird
will
sing
different
songs
in
different
regions
a
good
example
of
this
is
the
currawong
this
is
an
australia
bird
which
is
like
a
black
and
white
crow
in
the
autumn
families
get
together
in
large
flocks
and
do
a
lot
of
singing
currawongs
from
some
areas
sing
much
more
complex
songs
than
others
generally
currawongs
from
the
blue
mountains
are
the
finest
singers
the
song
of
the
currawong
can
be
sung
as
a
solo
but
is
often
performed
as
a
choir
one
bird
will
take
the
lead
and
sing
warble-warble-warble-warble
all
the
other
birds
will
join
in
and
sing
wooooooo
when
all
the
birds
know
the
song
the
choir
will
sing
the
warble
part
and
the
soloist
will
sing
the
woo
the
song
changes
from
year
to
year
and
from
place
to
place
the
austrian
naturalist
konrad
lorenz
studied
the
way
in
which
birds
communicate
or
talk
to
each
other
he
found
that
each
type
of
bird
had
a
number
of
sounds
which
they
made
automatically
when
ever
they
felt
a
certain
way
every
sound
had
an
action
that
went
with
it
so
if
the
bird
was
frightened
it
acted
frightened
and
made
a
frightened
sound
this
told
the
other
birds
around
it
that
something
frightening
was
happening
if
a
flock
of
birds
were
flying
over
a
field
they
would
be
calling
fly
fly
but
a
hungry
bird
seeing
something
good
to
eat
down
below
might
start
calling
food
food
if
other
birds
were
also
hungry
they
would
make
the
same
call
until
more
birds
were
calling
food
food
than
fly
fly
at
this
point
the
mind
of
the
flock
would
be
changed
some
of
the
birds
would
start
to
yell
fly
downwards
fly
downwards
as
they
sank
from
the
sky
until
the
whole
flock
was
all
noisily
calling
the
same
thing
these
communication
sounds
are
often
short
hard
sounds
like
chirps
squeaks
squawks
and
twitters
sometimes
the
calls
are
longer
and
more
musical
they
include
the
rookety-coo
sound
of
a
pigeon
and
the
cockadoodledoo
of
a
rooster
the
bird
cannot
change
these
sounds
they
always
make
them
in
the
same
way
the
bird
is
locked
into
making
each
sound
every
time
a
particular
idea
comes
into
its
head
the
connection
between
how
they
feel
and
how
they
call
is
innate:
they
are
born
with
it
some
calls
in
some
species
are
learnt
then
it
is
the
tendency
to
learn
which
is
inherited
konrad
lorenz
noticed
that
when
birds
sing
they
often
use
a
lot
of
their
regular
calls
as
part
of
the
song
lorenz
had
a
flock
of
jackdaws
which
were
scattered
during
world
war
ii
one
day
an
old
bird
returned
for
many
months
she
sat
on
the
chimney
singing
her
song
but
in
the
song
she
kept
making
the
call
which
lorenz
knew
meant
come
home
come
home
one
day
to
the
great
surprise
of
lorenz
a
male
bird
flew
from
a
passing
flock
and
joined
her
on
the
chimney
lorenz
was
sure
that
it
was
her
long-lost
husband
who
had
found
his
way
home
at
last
palaeontologists
have
found
some
exceptional
places
lagerstätten
where
fossils
of
early
birds
are
found
the
preservation
is
so
good
that
on
the
best
examples
impressions
of
their
feathers
can
be
seen
and
sometimes
even
the
remains
of
meals
they
have
eaten
from
these
remains
we
know
that
birds
evolved
from
small
carnivorous
dinosaurs
theropods
in
the
jurassic
period
they
radiated
into
a
huge
variety
in
the
lower
cretaceous
at
the
same
time
their
direct
competitors
the
pterosaurs
dwindled
in
numbers
and
variety
and
became
extinct
at
the
end
of
the
mesozoic
birds
are
classified
by
taxonomists
as
'aves'
avialae
birds
are
the
only
living
descendants
of
dinosaurs
strictly
speaking
they
are
dinosaurs
birds
and
crocodilia
are
the
only
living
members
of
the
once-dominant
archosaur
reptiles
the
class
aves
is
now
defined
as
all
the
descendants
of
the
most
recent
common
ancestor
of
modern
birds
and
archaeopteryx
lithographica
archaeopteryx
from
the
upper
jurassic
some
–
million
years
ago
is
the
earliest
bird
which
could
fly
it
is
famous
because
it
was
one
of
the
first
important
fossils
found
after
charles
darwin
published
his
ideas
about
evolution
in
the
th
century
by
modern
standards
archaeopteryx
could
not
fly
very
well
other
early
fossil
birds
are
for
example
confuciusornis
anchiornis
huxlei
and
other
paraves
many
fossils
of
early
birds
and
small
dinosaurs
have
been
discovered
in
the
liaoning
province
of
northeast
china
the
fossils
show
that
most
small
theropod
dinosaurs
had
feathers
these
deposits
have
preserved
them
so
well
that
the
impressions
of
their
feathers
can
be
clearly
seen
this
leads
us
to
think
that
feathers
evolved
first
as
heat
insulation
and
only
later
for
flight
the
origin
of
birds
lies
in
these
small
feathered
dinosaurs
palaeontologists
now
agree
that
birds
evolved
from
maniraptora
group
of
dinosaurs
this
explains
why
one
might
say
birds
are
living
dinosaurs
origin
of
birds
paraves
some
birds
are
eaten
as
food
most
usually
it
is
the
chicken
and
its
eggs
but
people
often
also
eat
geese
pheasants
turkeys
and
ducks
other
birds
are
sometimes
eaten
are
emus
ostriches
pigeons
grouse
quails
doves
woodcocks
and
even
songbirds
some
species
have
died
out
because
they
have
been
hunted
for
food
for
example
the
dodo
and
the
passenger
pigeon
many
species
have
learned
how
to
get
food
from
people
the
number
of
birds
of
these
species
has
grown
because
of
it
seagulls
and
crows
find
food
from
garbage
dumps
the
feral
pigeon
columba
livia
sparrows
passer
domesticus
and
starlings
sturnus
vulgaris
live
in
large
numbers
in
towns
and
cities
all
over
the
world
sometimes
people
also
use
working
birds
for
example
homing
pigeons
carry
messages
nowadays
people
sometimes
race
them
for
sport
people
also
use
falcons
for
hunting
and
cormorants
for
fishing
in
the
past
people
in
mines
often
used
a
canary
to
see
if
there
were
bad
gas
methane
in
the
air
people
often
have
colorful
birds
such
as
parrots
and
mynahs
as
pets
these
intelligent
birds
are
popular
because
they
can
copy
human
talking
because
of
this
some
people
trap
birds
and
take
them
to
other
countries
to
sell
this
is
not
usually
allowed
these
days
most
pet
birds
are
specially
bred
and
are
sold
in
pet
shops
people
can
catch
some
bird
diseases
for
example
psittacosis
salmonellosis
campylobacteriosis
newcastle's
disease
mycobacteriosis
influenza
giardiasis
and
cryptosporiadiosis
in
there
was
an
epidemic
of
bird
influenza
spreading
through
some
parts
of
the
world
often
called
avian
flu
some
people
have
birdboxes
in
their
gardens
to
give
birds
a
place
to
nest
and
bird
tables
where
birds
can
get
food
and
water
in
very
cold
or
very
dry
weather
this
lets
people
see
some
small
birds
close
up
which
are
normally
hidden
away
in
bushes
and
trees
most
marsupial
and
eutherian
mammals
have
a
reproductive
cycle
known
as
the
oestrous
cycle
s:
estrous
cycle
females
are
sexually
active
only
during
the
oestrous
stage
when
they
are
'on
heat'
for
a
few
days
each
month
if
an
ovum
is
not
fertilized
the
endometrium
uterus
lining
is
resorbed
oestrus
cycles
may
occur
once
or
twice
a
year
or
many
times
a
year
each
group
of
mammals
has
its
own
frequency
humans
and
primates
are
quite
different
they
have
a
menstrual
cycle
in
this
case
females
are
sexually
receptive
at
any
time
but
only
fertile
when
an
ovum
is
released
from
an
ovary
in
this
case
the
endometrium
if
not
needed
for
an
fertilised
egg
is
discarded
the
endometrium
is
shed
and
takes
with
it
a
certain
amount
of
blood
in
this
system
eggs
are
released
from
the
ovaries
mostly
in
the
middle
of
the
cycle
away
from
the
menstrual
period
this
ovulation
is
'concealed'
meaning
it
is
not
obvious
when
it
occurs
this
process
so
it
is
thought
tends
to
keep
the
male
and
female
together
which
is
unusual
in
mammals
with
the
oestrous
cycle
one
diagnostic
feature
is
the
lower
jaw
which
unlike
earlier
forms
is
composed
of
a
single
bone
the
dentary
this
is
one
feature
which
can
be
seen
in
fossils
or
at
least
those
which
are
complete
enough
to
have
the
lower
jaw
mammals
have
three
little
bones
in
their
inner
ear
the
ear
ossicles
the
ear
ossicles
are
bones
which
were
long
ago
part
of
the
lower
jaw
in
early
proto-mammals
there
are
quite
a
number
of
other
features
particularly
in
the
skull
and
limbs
so
that
it
is
usually
possible
identify
and
describe
a
mammal
from
its
skeleton
alone
another
diagnostic
feature
is
the
neocortex
of
the
brain
which
no
other
vertebrate
has
this
is
involved
in
the
kind
of
flexible
behavior
and
learning
typical
of
mammals
reptiles
and
birds
have
much
of
their
behavior
controlled
by
inherited
behavior
chains
which
roughly
translates
as
instincts
almost
all
animals
can
do
some
learning
but
mammals
do
far
more
than
other
vertebrates
their
behavior
is
much
more
flexible
than
lizards
for
example
and
that
is
made
possible
by
their
neocortex
other
things
in
the
life
of
mammals
seem
to
be
connected
with
this
flexibility
and
learning
play
is
a
kind
of
early
learning
period
in
which
according
to
one
theory
mammals
develop
skills
which
they
will
need
in
life
all
mammalian
young
play
and
this
is
very
obvious
in
the
more
intelligent
mammals
primates
cats
the
emotions
of
mammals
are
very
noticeable
and
rather
similar
to
ours
it
is
possible
and
quite
common
for
humans
to
have
a
friendly
relationship
with
another
mammal
it
is
quite
impossible
for
a
human
to
have
any
kind
of
relationship
with
a
snake
or
a
gecko
for
example
this
is
because
the
reptile
simply
does
not
have
the
same
basic
emotions
as
a
human
there
are
about
characters
which
are
typical
of
mammals
and
some
of
the
most
important
are
discussed
above
a
few
more
examples
will
make
it
clear
that
mammals
are
very
different
from
reptiles
and
birds:
sweat
glands
tooth
replacement:
two
sets
and
no
continuous
replacement
enamel
on
the
tooth
surface
reptile
teeth
all
alike
mammal
teeth
follow
a
pattern
incisors
canines
premolars
and
molars
occipital
condyles
two
knobs
at
the
base
of
the
skull
fit
into
the
topmost
neck
vertebra
most
tetrapods
in
contrast
have
only
one
such
knob
outlet
for
food
waste
separate
from
urinogenital
outlet
reptiles
and
birds
have
a
common
cloaca
at
the
rear
mammals
excrete
urea
reptiles
and
birds
excrete
uric
acid
colour
vision
is
defective
or
absent
in
most
mammals
primates
are
an
exception
in
reptiles
and
birds
the
blood
vessel
which
carries
oxygenated
blood
from
the
left
ventricle
of
the
heart
lies
on
the
right
side
of
the
body
but
in
mammals
it
lies
on
the
left
side
there
are
many
features
of
the
skeleton
that
mammals
share
their
neck
almost
always
has
seven
vertebrae
no
matter
how
long
it
is
their
lower
jaw
is
made
of
just
a
single
bone
on
each
side
the
dentary
their
inner
ear
has
three
tiny
bones
the
ossicles:
malleus
incus
and
stapes
in
the
language
of
cladistics
these
unique
characters
are
apomorphies
which
prove
that
mammals
are
a
clade
descended
from
a
common
ancestor
almost
all
mammal
species
give
birth
to
live
young
there
are
only
two
mammals
that
lay
eggs
called
monotremes
the
duck-billed
platypus
ornithorhynchus
and
the
spiny
anteater
echidna
with
four
species
all
are
confined
to
australia
and
new
guinea
and
are
the
sole
survivors
of
an
earlier
group
of
mammals
however
like
other
mammals
they
feed
milk
to
their
young
and
protect
and
look
after
them
other
mammals
are
divided
into
the
marsupials
and
the
eutheria
the
placental
mammals
marsupials
are
mammals
with
pouches
to
carry
young
in
like
the
kangaroo
in
terms
of
number
of
species
mammals
with
species
are
not
the
most
successful
vertebrates
birds
with
about
species
have
nearly
twice
as
many
and
reptiles
have
just
as
many
as
birds
fish
have
even
more
species
there
are
species
of
fish
of
which
nearly
are
bony
fish
despite
this
many
zoologists
do
regard
mammals
as
a
successful
group
of
animals
one
reason
is
that
they
are
successful
in
all
habitats
on
earth
in
the
air
in
the
water
in
forests
in
the
colder
regions
of
the
world
and
above
all
on
grasslands
where
they
are
outstandingly
successful
in
the
air
the
bats
chiroptera
are
the
mammalian
order
with
the
most
species
they
'own'
the
nighttime
since
birds
are
largely
diurnal
daytime
animals
bats
are
hugely
successful
mostly
as
nighttime
predators
of
insects
seagoing
mammals
the
cetacea
and
the
pinnipeds
are
very
successful
and
significant
predators
this
includes
the
whales
seals
walrus
dolphins
and
others
the
terrestrial
mammals
are
fewer
in
number
of
species
than
lizards
but
they
are
huge
in
individual
numbers
and
far
more
important
in
the
life
of
the
terrestrial
biomes
their
ability
to
move
from
place
to
place
and
adapt
has
made
them
a
most
effective
group
many
mammals
live
in
cold
places
these
mammals
have
thick
hair
or
blubber
to
keep
them
warm
others
may
live
in
rainforests
on
land
the
rodents
rats
mice
are
hugely
successful
more
common
in
numbers
than
any
other
mammals
large
mammals
on
land
have
been
hunted
to
extinction
in
some
parts
of
the
world
but
the
ones
which
remain
are
now
better
protected
last
but
certainly
not
least
are
the
primates
their
natural
habitat
with
few
exceptions
are
the
forests
most
live
in
the
trees
with
hands
that
grasp
good
colour
vision
and
intelligence
in
the
pliocene
period
some
moved
out
onto
the
savannahs
as
grassland
replaced
forests
mankind
is
the
result
of
this
shift
into
the
savannahs
the
evolutionary
relationships
among
land
vertebrates
is
as
follows:
tetrapoda
land
vertebrates
amphibia
lay
eggs
in
water
amniota
lay
cleidoic
eggs
sauropsida
all
true
'reptiles'
synapsida
all
'mammal-like
amniotes'
pelycosauria
therapsida
in
particular
the
cynodontia
mammalia
bear
live
young
milk
raise
their
young
etc
this
sort
of
classification
is
not
traditional
but
it
does
reflect
our
knowledge
of
palaeontology
and
evolution
a
somewhat
standardized
classification
system
has
been
adopted
by
most
current
mammalogy
classroom
textbooks
it
is
based
on
living
animals
the
following
taxonomy
of
extant
and
recently
extinct
mammals
is
from
vaughan
et
al
class
mammalia
subclass
prototheria:
monotremes:
platypuses
and
echidnas
subclass
theria:
live-bearing
mammals
infraclass
metatheria:
marsupials
infraclass
eutheria:
placentals
mammals
can
be
divided
in
a
number
of
orders:
monotremes
monotremata
marsupials
marsupialia
eutheria
superorder
xenarthra
order
pilosa

because
two
quite
different
dates
are
given
in
the
taxobox
an
explanation
is
needed
rowe
defines
mammals
as
the
taxon
originating
with
the
most
recent
common
ancestor
of
extant
[living]
monotremata
and
theria
that
puts
the
emphasis
heavily
on
living
mammals
where
as
rowe
points
out
the
database
of
characters
is
extensive
kemp
explains
the
problem
with
that
approach:
if
the
definition
of
a
mammal
is
based
rigorously
upon
possession
of
all
the
characters
of
living
mammals
then
some
fossil
forms
that
are
extremely
mammalian
in
anatomy
are
excluded
an
altogether
different
perspective
on
defining
mammalia
is
based
on
traditional
palaeobiological
practice
an
arbitrary
decision
is
made
about
which
characters
to
select
as
defining
characters
characters
deemed
appropriate
are
those
reflecting
the
fundamental
mammalian
biology
the
essence
of
mammalian
life
is
to
be
found
in
their
endothermic
temperature
physiology
greatly
enlarged
brain
dentition
capable
of
chewing
food
highly
agile
energetic
locomotion
and
so
on
the
organisms
that
achieved
this
grade
of
overall
organisation
are
deemed
to
be
mammalia
around
the
end
of
the
triassic
period
about
mya
a
number
of
fossils
are
found
of
very
small
animals
that
have
[most]
of
the
skeletal
characters
of
modern
mammals
this
difference
in
outlook
explains
the
difference
in
the
two
dates
given
in
the
taxobox

a
bacterium
reproduces
creates
more
bacteria
by
dividing
in
half
and
creating
two
daughter
cells
each
daughter
is
identical
in
shape
to
the
parent
but
is
smaller
bacteria
do
not
have
sexes
but
they
do
transmit
dna
by
several
kinds
of
horizontal
gene
transfer
this
is
how
they
share
resistance
to
antibiotics
from
one
strain
to
another
the
complete
dna
sequence
is
known
for
many
bacterial
strains
bacteria
vary
widely
in
size
and
shape
but
in
general
they
are
at
least
ten
times
larger
than
viruses
a
typical
bacterium
is
about
µm
one
micrometer
in

fungi
reproduce
both
sexually
and
asexually
some
fungi
grow
mushrooms:
these
are
fruiting
bodies
under
the
cap
there
are
gills
the
gills
bear
spores
that
will
disperse
and
may
develop
into
new
fungi
otherwise
fungi
use
a
sporangium
to
bear
asexual
spores
by
mitosis
or
sexual
spores
by
meiosis
the
spores
are
haploid
fungi
may
be
single
celled
or
multicellular
yeast
is
single-celled
and
reproduces
either
sexually
or
asexually
asexual
reproduction
occurs
by
simple
budding
binary
fission
the
mycelium
is
the
vegetative
non-reproductive
part
of
a
fungus
it
is
usually
underground
or
inside
some
other
substance
and
made
of
filaments
called
hyphae
hyphae
look
like
threads
or
rootlets
the
mat
of
hyphae
may
be
very
thickly
woven
the
fungus
uses
them
to
extract
nutrients
hyphae
are
usually
syncytia
this
means
the
cell
walls
septa
are
mostly
not
complete
and
the
cell
nuclei
are
not
separated
from
each
other
as
in
normal
cells
details
differ
between
species
symbiosis
means
living
together
lichens
are
a
symbiosis
between
a
fungus
and
an
alga
or
bacterium
in
this
partnership
the
algal
cells
live
inside
the
fungus
tissue
the
end
result
is
a
new
mat-like
life-form
which
clings
to
rock
and
other
surfaces
about
of
all
fungi
are
lichenized
another
important
kind
of
symbiosis
is
mycorrhiza
this
is
when
a
fungus
lives
inside
plant
roots
most
trees
have
mycorrhizal
roots
and
so
do
many
crop
plants
both
sides
benefit
in
this
arrangement
some
fungi
cause
crop
diseases
others
cause
serious
disease
in
humans
some
are
highly
poisonous:
never
eat
a
mushroom
picked
in
the
wild
unless
you
know
what
you
are
doing
edible
fungi
are
widely
used
as
human
food
certain
types
of
cheese
need
a
fungal
species
to
be
added
the
fungi
give
a
unique
flavor
and
texture
to
the
cheese
some
fungi
produce
psychotropic
mind-altering
substances
several
species
most
notably
psilocybin
mushrooms
colloquially
known
as
magic
mushrooms
are
taken
for
their
psychedelic
properties
so
they
are
illegal
in
many
countries
around
the
world
in
modern
times
some
fungi
for
example
penicillin
have
been
used
as
a
source
of
antibiotics
the
antibiotics
are
produced
by
many
fungi
as
a
natural
defence
against
bacteria

before
people
studied
substances
to
figure
out
how
to
do
things
such
as
turn
lead
into
gold
but
no
one
managed
to
do
that
this
was
called
alchemy
alchemists
separated
the
air
into
many
parts
and
isolated
the
noble
gases
from
it
they
also
processed
special
minerals
from
a
mine
in
sweden
to
get
rare
earth
metals
radioactivity
was
also
discovered
today
chemists
have
discovered
different
elements
some
are
very
common
like
oxygen
many
are
very
rare
and
expensive
like
platinum
some
cannot
be
found
on
earth
and
can
only
be
made
in
labs
like
rutherfordium
since
the
the
increased
understanding
of
physics
has
changed
chemists'
theories
about
chemical
reactions
with
smaller
and
faster
computers
chemists
have
built
better
tools
for
analyzing
substances
these
tools
have
been
sent
to
study
chemicals
on
mars
police
also
use
those
tools
to
study
evidence
from
crime
scenes
there
are
several
types
of
chemistry
analytical
chemistry
looks
at
which
chemicals
are
in
things
for
example
looking
at
how
much
arsenic
is
in
food
organic
chemistry
looks
at
things
that
have
carbon
in
them
for
example
making
acetylene
inorganic
chemistry
looks
at
things
that
do
not
have
carbon
in
them
one
example
is
making
an
integrated
circuit
a
large
area
of
chemistry
is
polymer
chemistry
this
looks
at
plastics
one
example
is
making
nylon
because
plastics
are
made
of
carbon
polymer
chemistry
is
part
of
organic
chemistry
another
area
is
biochemistry
this
looks
at
the
chemistry
of
living
things
an
example
would
be
seeing
how
arsenic
poisons
people
biochemistry
is
also
part
of
organic
chemistry
there
are
many
other
small
branches
of
chemistry
the
basic
unit
of
an
element
is
called
an
atom
an
atom
is
the
smallest
building
block
that
you
can
cut
an
element
into
without
the
element
breaking
down
turning
into
a
lighter
element
for
example
through
nuclear
fission
or
radioactive
decay
a
chemical
compound
is
a
substance
made
up
of
two
or
more
elements
in
a
compound
two
or
more
atoms
are
joined
together
to
form
a
molecule
the
tiniest
speck
of
dust
or
drop
of
liquid
that
one
can
see
is
made
up
of
many
millions
or
billions
of
these
molecules
mixtures
are
substances
where
chemicals
are
mixed
but
not
reacted
an
example
would
be
mixing
sand
and
salt
this
can
be
undone
again
to
produce
salt
and
sand
separately
chemical
compounds
are
changed
by
a
chemical
reaction
an
example
would
be
heating
sodium
bicarbonate
common
baking
soda
it
will
make
water
carbon
dioxide
and
sodium
carbonate
this
reaction
cannot
be
undone
one
very
important
concept
in
chemistry
is
that
different
atoms
interact
with
one
another
in
very
specific
proportions
for
example
two
hydrogen
atoms
interacting
with
one
oxygen
atom
lead
to
the
water
molecule
ho
this
relationship
is
known
as
the
law
of
constant
proportions
and
leads
to
the
idea
of
stoichiometry
a
term
that
refers
to
the
ratios
of
different
atoms
in
chemical
compounds
for
example
in
water
there
are
always
exactly
hydrogen
atoms
to
oxygen
atom
in
carbon
dioxide
there
are
exactly
oxygen
atoms
for
carbon
atom
these
relationships
are
described
using
chemical
formulas
such
as
ho
two
hydrogen
atoms
and
one
oxygen
atom
and
co
one
carbon
atom
and
two
oxygen
atoms
because
atoms
of
different
elements
react
with
one
another
in
very
specific
proportions
but
atoms
of
different
elements
have
different
weights
chemists
often
describe
the
amount
of
different
elements
and
compounds
in
terms
of
the
number
of
moles
a
mole
of
any
element
contains
the
same
number
of
atoms:
atoms
the
atomic
mass
of
an
element
can
be
used
to
see
how
much
of
the
element
makes
a
mole
for
example
the
atomic
mass
of
copper
is
about
that
means
about
grams
of
copper
metal
has
a
mole
of
atoms
the
atomic
mass
of
chlorine
is
about
that
means
grams
of
chlorine
has
a
mole
of
atoms
in
it
moles
can
be
used
to
see
how
many
molecules
are
in
chemical
compounds
too
copperii
chloride
is
an
example
cucl
is
its
chemical
formula
there
is
one
copper
atom
and
two
chlorine
atoms
·
=
add
all
the
molar
masses
of
the
elements
together
to
get
the
molar
mass
of
the
chemical
compound
=
that
means
in
grams
of
copperii
chloride
there
is
one
mole
of
copperii
chloride
molecules
this
concept
is
used
to
calculate
how
much
chemicals
are
needed
in
a
chemical
reaction
if
no
reactants
chemicals
that
are
reacted
should
be
left
if
too
much
reactant
is
used
there
will
be
some
reactants
left
in
the
chemical
reaction
acids
and
bases
are
common
chemicals
acids
release
h
ions
when
in
water
and
bases
release
oh−
ions
when
in
water
acids
can
react
with
bases
the
h
ion
is
taken
from
the
acid
by
the
base
this
makes
water
ho
a
salt
is
also
made
when
an
acid
and
a
base
react
together
an
example
would
be
reacting
hydrochloric
acid
hcl
and
sodium
hydroxide
naoh
hydrochloric
acid
releases
h
and
cl-
ions
in
water
the
base
releases
na
and
oh-
ions
the
h
and
the
oh-
react
to
make
water
there
is
a
solution
of
sodium
chloride

sodium
chloride

a

chemists
are
constantly
working
to
find
new
and
useful
substances
chemists
make
new
drugs
and
materials
like
paints
that
we
use
every
day
many
chemicals
are
harmless
but
there
are
some
chemicals
that
are
dangerous
for
example
mercuryii
chloride
is
very
toxic
chromates
can
cause
cancer
tinii
chloride
pollutes
water
easily
hydrochloric
acid

cause
bad

some
chemicals
like
hydrogen

explode
or
catch

elements
can
join

to
form
pure
compounds
such
as
water
salts
oxides

in
many
cases
these
compounds
have
a

some
elements

to
form
new

such
new

most
elements
are

elements
can
also
be
classified
into
metals
and
non-metals
there
are
many
more

however
a

convection
the
air
always
has
some
water
mixed
with
it
this
is
called
humidity
when
it
cools
the
water
can
change
from
a
gas
to
a
liquid
through
condensation
then
the
water
can
fall
from
the
sky
as
rain
or
snow
after
the
air
rises
it
gets
colder
and
goes
back
towards
the
ground
because
the
air
lost
its
water
before
it
is
dry
when
it
comes
back
to
the
ground
wind
is
made
when
two
areas
of
air
of
different
temperatures
meet
this
is
called
a
warm
front
or
cold
front
the
hot
air
is
forced
to
rise
over
the
cold
causing
condensation
which
forms
rain
the
ways
that
the
air
moves
around
the
earth
are
called
atmospheric
circulation
astronomy
is
the
oldest
natural
science
the
sumerians
ancient
egyptians
and
indus
valley
civilization
all
understood
that
the
objects
in
the
sky
moved
since
before
bc
this
is
because
they
worshiped
the
objects
in
the
sky
as
gods
their
understanding
wasn't
scientific
but
their
observations
influenced
later
astronomy
a
significant
amount
of
astronomy
came
from
mesopotamia
babylonia
ancient
egypt
and
ancient
greece
astronomers
from
egypt
built
monuments
that
showed
how
objects
in
the
sky
moved
and
most
of
the
names
for
the
constellations
in
the
northern
hemisphere
came
from
greek
astronomers
natural
philosophy
started
in
greece
around
bc
when
a
movement
of
philosophers
replaced
superstition
with
naturalism
which
refuted
the
spiritual
leucippus
and
his
student
democritus
suggested
the
idea
of
the
atom
around
this
period
islamic
scholars
continued
to
study
aristotelian
physics
during
the
islamic
golden
age
they
also
developed
an
early
form
of
the
scientific
method
scientists
like
ibn
sahl
al-kindi
ibn
al-haytham
al-farisi
and
avicenna
worked
extensively
on
optics
and
vision
in
the
book
of
optics
ibn
al-haytham
rejected
previous
greek
ideas
concerning
vision
and
proposed
a
new
theory
he
studied
how
light
enters
the
eye
and
then
developed
the
camera
obscura
european
scientists
later
built
eyeglasses
magnifying
glasses
telescopes
and
cameras
from
this
book
physics
became
a
separate
field
of
study
after
the
scientific
revolution
galileo's
experiments
helped
to
create
classical
physics
although
he
did
not
invent
the
telescope
he
used
it
when
he
looked
into
the
night
sky
he
discovered
that
the
stars
and
planets
were
not
perfect
he
also
investigated
gravity
isaac
newton
used
galileo's
ideas
to
create
his
three
laws
of
motion
he
also
developed
calculus
to
help
understand
problems
in
mechanics
such
as
how
celestial
bodies
moved
around
the
sun
in
a
couple
centuries
the
industrial
revolution
was
in
full
swing
and
many
more
discoveries
were
made
in
many
fields
of
science
the
laws
of
classical
physics
are
good
enough
to
study
objects
that
move
much
slower
than
the
speed
of
light
and
are
not
microscopic
when
scientists
first
studied
quantum
mechanics
they
had
to
create
a
new
set
of
laws
which
was
the
start
of
modern
physics
as
scientists
researched
particles
they
discovered
what
classical
mechanics
could
not
explain
classical
mechanics
predicted
that
the
speed
of
light
varied
but
experiments
showed
the
speed
of
light
stayed
the
same
this
was
predicted
by
albert
einstein's
theory
of
special
relativity
einstein
predicted
that
the
speed
of
electromagnetic
radiation
through
empty
space
would
always
be
the
same
his
view
of
space-time
replaced
the
ancient
idea
that
space
and
time
were
quite
separate
things
max
planck
came
up
with
quantum
mechanics
to
explain
why
metal
releases
electrons
when
you
shine
a
light
at
it
and
why
matter
emits
radiation
quantum
mechanics
applies
for
very
small
things
like
the
electrons
protons
and
neutrons
that
make
up
an
atom
people
like
werner
heisenberg
erwin
schrödinger
and
paul
dirac
continued
to
work
on
quantum
mechanics
and
eventually
we
got
the
standard
model
physics
is
the
study
of
energy
and
matter
in
space
and
time
and
how
they
are
related
to
each
other
physicists
assume
the
existence
of
mass
length
time
and
electric
current
and
then
define
give
the
meaning
of
all
other
physical
quantities
in
terms
of
these
basic
units
mass
length
time
and
electric
current
are
never
defined
but
the
standard
units
used
to
measure
them
are
always
defined
in
the
international
system
of
units
abbreviated
si
from
the
french
système
international
the
kilogram
is
the
basic
unit
of
mass
the
metre
is
the
basic
unit
of
length
the
second
is
the
basic
unit
of
time
and
the
ampere
is
the
basic
unit
of
electric
current
in
addition
to
these
four
units
there
are
three
other
ones:
the
mole
which
is
the
unit
of
the
quantity
of
matter
the
candela
which
measures
the
luminous
intensity
the
power
of
lighting
and
the
kelvin
the
unit
of
temperature
physics
studies
how
things
move
and
the
forces
that
make
them
move
for
example
velocity
and
acceleration
are
used
by
physics
to
show
how
things
move
also
physicists
study
the
forces
of
gravity
electricity
magnetism
and
the
forces
that
hold
things
together
physics
studies
very
large
things
and
very
small
things
for
instance
physicists
can
study
stars
planets
and
galaxies
but
could
also
study
small
pieces
of
matter
such
as
atoms
and
electrons
they
may
also
study
sound
light
and
other
waves
as
well
as
that
they
could
examine
energy
heat
and
radioactivity
and
even
space
and
time
physics
not
only
helps
people
understand
how
objects
move
but
how
they
change
form
how
they
make
noise
how
hot
or
cold
they
will
be
and
what
they
are
made
of
at
the
smallest
level
physics
is
a
quantitative
science
because
it
is
based
on
measuring
with
numbers
mathematics
is
used
in
physics
to
make
models
that
try
to
guess
what
will
happen
in
nature
the
guesses
are
compared
to
the
way
the
real
world
works
these
guesses
are
made
by
theoretical
physicists
and
they
are
compared
to
the
real
world
by
experimental
physicists
physicists
are
always
working
to
make
their
models
of
the
world
better
physics
is
the
science
of
matter
and
how
matter
interacts
matter
is
any
physical
material
in
the
universe
everything
is
made
of
matter
physics
is
used
to
describe
the
physical
universe
around
us
and
to
predict
how
it
will
behave
physics
is
the
science
concerned
with
the
discovery
and
characterization
of
the
universal
laws
which
govern
matter
movement
and
forces
and
space
and
time
and
other
features
of
the
natural
world
the
sweep
of
physics
is
broad
from
the
smallest
components
of
matter
and
the
forces
that
hold
it
together
to
galaxies
and
even
larger
things
there
are
only
four
forces
that
appear
to
operate
over
this
whole
range
however
even
these
four
forces
gravity
electromagnetism
the
weak
force
associated
with
radioactivity
and
the
strong
force
which
holds
protons
and
neutrons
in
an
atom
together
are
believed
to
be
different
parts
of
a
single
force
physics
is
mainly
focused
on
the
goal
of
making
ever
simpler
more
general
and
more
accurate
rules
that
define
the
character
and
behavior
of
matter
and
space
itself
one
of
the
major
goals
of
physics
is
making
theories
that
apply
to
everything
in
the
universe
in
other
words
physics
can
be
viewed
as
the
study
of
those
universal
laws
which
define
at
the
most
basic
level
possible
the
behavior
of
the
physical
universe
physics
uses
the
scientific
method
that
is
data
from
experiments
and
observations
are
collected
theories
which
attempt
to
explain
these
data
are
produced
physics
uses
these
theories
to
not
only
describe
physical
phenomena
but
to
model
physical
systems
and
predict
how
these
physical
systems
will
behave
physicists
then
compare
these
predictions
to
observations
or
experimental
evidence
to
show
whether
the
theory
is
right
or
wrong
the
theories
that
are
well
supported
by
data
and
are
especially
simple
and
general
are
sometimes
called
scientific
laws
of
course
all
theories
including
those
known
as
laws
can
be
replaced
by
more
accurate
and
more
general
laws
when
a
disagreement
with
data
is
found
physics
is
more
quantitative
than
most
other
sciences
that
is
many
of
the
observations
in
physics
may
be
represented
in
the
form
of
numerical
measurements
most
of
the
theories
in
physics
use
mathematics
to
express
their
principles
most
of
the
predictions
from
these
theories
are
numerical
this
is
because
of
the
areas
which
physics
has
addressed
work
better
with
quantitative
approaches
than
other
areas
sciences
also
tend
to
become
more
quantitative
with
time
as
they
become
more
highly
developed
and
physics
is
one
of
the
oldest
sciences
classical
physics
normally
includes
the
fields
of
mechanics
optics
electricity
magnetism
acoustics
and
thermodynamics
modern
physics
is
a
term
normally
used
to
cover
fields
which
rely
on
quantum
theory
including
quantum
mechanics
atomic
physics
nuclear
physics
particle
physics
and
condensed
matter
physics
as
well
as
the
more
modern
fields
of
general
and
special
relativity
but
these
last
two
are
often
considered
fields
of
classical
physics
as
they
do
not
rely
on
quantum
theory
although
this
difference
can
be
found
in
older
writings
it
is
of
little
new
interest
as
quantum
effects
are
now
understood
to
be
of
importance
even
in
fields
that
before
were
called
classical
there
are
many
approaches
to
studying
physics
and
many
different
kinds
of
activities
in
physics
there
are
two
main
types
of
activities
in
physics
the
collection
of
data
and
the
development
of
theories
the
data
in
some
subfields
of
physics
is
amenable
to
experiment
for
example
condensed
matter
physics
and
nuclear
physics
benefit
from
the
ability
to
perform
experiments
experimental
physics
focuses
mainly
on
an
empirical
approach
sometimes
experiments
are
done
to
explore
nature
and
in
other
cases
experiments
are
performed
to
produce
data
to
compare
with
the
predictions
of
theories
some
other
fields
in
physics
like
astrophysics
and
geophysics
are
mostly
observational
sciences
because
most
of
their
data
has
to
be
collected
passively
instead
of
through
experimentation
however
observational
programs
in
these
fields
use
many
of
the
same
tools
and
technology
that
are
used
in
the
experimental
subfields
of
physics
theoretical
physics
often
uses
quantitative
approaches
to
develop
the
theories
that
attempt
to
explain
the
data
in
this
way
theoretical
physicists
often
use
tools
from
mathematics
theoretical
physics
often
can
involve
creating
quantitative
predictions
of
physical
theories
and
comparing
these
predictions
quantitatively
with
data
theoretical
physics
sometimes
creates
models
of
physical
systems
before
data
is
available
to
test
and
support
these
models
these
two
main
activities
in
physics
data
collection
theory
production
and
testing
use
many
different
skills
this
has
led
to
a
lot
of
specialization
in
physics
and
the
introduction
development
and
use
of
tools
from
other
fields
for
example
theoretical
physicists
use
mathematics
and
numerical
analysis
and
statistics
and
probability
and
computer
software
in
their
work
experimental
physicists
develop
instruments
and
techniques
for
collecting
data
using
engineering
and
computer
technology
and
many
other
fields
of
technology
often
the
tools
from
these
other
areas
are
not
quite
appropriate
for
the
needs
of
physics
and
need
to
be
changed
or
more
advanced
versions
have
to
be
made
it
is
frequent
for
new
physics
to
be
discovered
if
experimental
physicists
do
an
experiment
that
current
theories
cannot
explain
or
for
theoretical
physicists
to
generate
theories
which
can
then
be
put
to
the
test
by
experimental
physicists
experimental
physics
engineering
and
technology
are
related
experiments
often
need
specialized
tools
such
as
particle
accelerators
lasers
and
important
industrial
applications
such
as
transistors
and
magnetic
resonance

have
come
from

anymore
this
problem
is
called
lactose

there
are
many
medicines
that
help

digest
lactose
many
lactose-intolerant
people
drink
soy

in

or

the
idea
of
human
rights
originated
from
ideas
found
in
religion
and
philosophy
in
western
europe
the
modern
western
idea
of
human
rights
started
in
the
european
enlightenment
in
the
th
century
some
people
started
suggesting
that
everyone
had
the
religious
and
political
right
to
choose
their
religion
and
their
leaders
this
sort
of
thinking
was
important
in
the
english
civil
war
after
the
war
the
philosopher
john
locke
argued
that
people
should
have
these
rights
he
was
one
of
the
first
people
to
call
them
human
rights
these
ideas
were
also
important
in
the
american
revolution
and
the
french
revolution
in
the
th
century
in
the
th
century
john
stuart
mill
was
an
important
philosopher
who
also
thought
about
human
rights
he
said
that
people
should
be
able
to
control
their
own
bodies
and
minds
he
talked
about
three
special
ideas:
freedom
of
speech
freedom
of
assembly
freedom
to
do
what
a
person
wishes
if
it
does
not
harm
others
even
if
other
people
think
it
is
badhegel
was
a
philosopher
who
talked
about
the
idea
of
free
will
he
also
talked
about
what
makes
a
person
free:
that
a
person
has
to
have
certain
relations
with
other
people
to
have
true
freedom
a
person
has
to
be
able
to:
own
property
make
contracts
with
other
people
make
moral
promises
to
people
live
with
anyone
get
protection
from
laws
have
a
voice
in
government
because
people
believe
that
human
rights
are
important
countries
make
laws
to
protect
them
these
laws
say
that
governments
cannot
take
away
people's
basic
rights
they
make
sure
people
who
take
away
other
people's
rights
are
punished
some
major
political
organizations
have
made
statements
that
promote
human
rights
these
are
not
laws
but
they
affect
us
anyway
if
groups
or
countries
do
not
follow
these
statements
others
will
condemn
them
say
that
they
are
very
bad
and
then
people
may
not
talk
with
them
do
business
with
them
or
help
them
some
of
the
important
places
that
human
rights
laws
are
written
is
in
constitutions
the
united
states
constitution
and
constitution
of
france
are
two
of
the
oldest
set
of
laws
based
on
human
rights
in
the
united
nations
made
the
universal
declaration
of
human
rights
this
is
a
widely
respected
document
that
says
what
the
united
nations
believes
are
human
rights
it
is
not
a
law
but
is
the
basis
on
which
two
important
agreements
are
written:
the
international
covenant
on
civil
and
political
rights
the
international
covenant
on
economic
social
and
cultural
rightsthese
are
united
nations
human
rights
covenants:
agreements
between
people
or
countries
the
countries
who
sign
these
two
covenants
agree
to
follow
them
in
addition
to
those
declaration
and
covenants
there
are
many
treaties
and
documents
made
by
united
nations
and
other
international
organizations
those
treaties
and
documents
are
called
international
human
rights
law
not
everyone
agrees
on
what
the
basic
human
rights
are
it
is
very
clear
that
few
countries
permit
all
these
rights
also
there
are
countries
in
which
the
rights
are
not
illegal
but
nothing
is
done
to
promote
them
here
is
a
list
of
some
of
the
most
recognized
rights:
right
to
live
to
be
a
citizen
of
a
country
right
to
housing
to
own
property
safety
from
violence
physical
mental
and
sexual
to
seek
asylum
if
a
country
treats
you
badly
fair
trial
and
to
be
considered
innocent
until
proven
guilty
the
right
to
get
an
education
health
care
medical
care
to
believe
and
practice
the
religion
a
person
wants
right
to
marriage
and
family
equality
of
both
males
and
females
women's
rights
not
be
forced
into
marriage
the
right
to
express
his
or
her
sexual
orientation
the
right
to
express
oneself:
free
speech
to
vote
to
peacefully
protest
speak
against
a
government
or
group
to
petition
abuse
means
to
intentionally
harm
a
person
or
people
physically
mentally
emotionally
or
verbally
once
or
many
times
human
rights
abuse
follows
along
similarly
also
keeping
in
count
the
universal
rights
human
rights
abuse
happens
when
a
person
is
hurt
in
a
way
that
violates
goes
against
his/her
human
rights
human
rights
abuses
are
also
often
called
human
rights
violations
examples
of
human
rights
abuses
or
violations
are:putting
a
person
in
jail
because
they
said
that
the
government
is
doing
bad
things
or
because
they
are
religious
or
not
religious
taking
a
person's
home
because
they
are
from
a
different
country
not
letting
someone
who
is
a
citizen
of
a
country
vote
because
he
or
she
has
the
wrong
kind
of
attribute
as
mentioned
on
top
of
article
violence
toward
someone
because
they
have
a
or
any
religion
or
a
different
religion
to
the
one
of
the
abuser
many
people
groups
and
countries
think
protecting
human
rights
is
very
important
but
not
everyone
in
the
world
believes
in
human
rights
if
people
who
do
not
believe
in
human
rights
have
political
power
they
can
hurt
many
people
even
if
these
people
have
no
political
power
they
can
be
violent
to
other
people
there
are
many
people
who
work
to
protect
everyone's
human
rights
some
of
these
are
government
groups
and
some
are
not
with
any
government
they
are
sometimes
called
human
rights
organizations
amnesty
international
and
human
rights
watch
are
examples
of
human

art
is
divided
into
the
plastic
arts
where
something
is
made
and
the
performing
arts
where
something
is
done
by
humans
in
action
the
other
division
is
between
pure
arts
done
for
themselves
and
practical
arts
done
for
a
practical
purpose
but
with
artistic
content
plastic
arts
fine
art
is
expression
by
making
something
beautiful
or
appealing
to
the
emotions
by
visual
means:
drawing
painting
printmaking

literature:
poetry
creative
writing
performing
arts
performing
art
including
drama
are
expression
using
the
body:

auditory
art
expression
by
making
sounds:
music
singing
practical

culinary
art
expression
by
making
flavors
and
tastes:
cooking
the
practical
arts
expression
by
making
things
and
structures:
architecture
filming
fashion
photography
video
games
some
people
say
that
art
is
a
product
or
item
that
is
made
with
the
intention
of
stimulating
the
human
senses
as
well
as
the
human
mind
spirit
and
soul
an
artwork
is
normally
judged
by
how
much
impact
it
has
on
people
the
number
of
people
who
can
relate
to
it
and
how
much
they
appreciate
it
some
people
also
get
inspired
the
first
and
broadest
sense
of
art
means
arrangement
or
to
arrange
in
this
sense
art
is
created
when
someone
arranges
things
found
in
the
world
into
a
new
or
different
design
or
form
or
when
someone
arranges
colors
next
to
each
other
in
a
painting
to
make
an
image
or
just
to
make
a
pretty
or
interesting
design
art
may
express
emotion
artists
may
feel
a
certain
emotion
and
wish
to
express
it
by
creating
something
that
means
something
to
them
most
of
the
art
created
in
this
case
is
made
for
the
artist
rather
than
an
audience
however
if
an
audience
is
able
to
connect
with
the
emotion
as
well
then
the
art
work
may
become
publicly
successful
there
are
sculptures
cave
painting
and
rock
art
dating
from
the
upper
paleolithic
era
all
of
the
great
ancient
civilizations
such
as
ancient
egypt
india
china
greece
rome
and
persia
had
works
and
styles
of

there
are
many
chinese
artistic
styles
which
are
usually
named
after
the
ruling
dynasty
in
europe
after
the
middle
ages
there
was
a
renaissance
which
means
rebirth
people
rediscovered
science
and
artists
were
allowed
to
paint
subjects
other
than
religious
subjects
people
like
michelangelo
and
leonardo
da
vinci
still
painted
religious
pictures
but
they
also
now
could
paint
mythological
pictures
too
these
artists
also
invented
perspective
where
things
in
the
distance
look
smaller
in
the
picture
this
was
new
because
in
the
middle
ages
people
would
paint
all
the
figures
close
up
and
just
overlapping
each
other
in
the
late
artists
in
europe
responding
to
modernity
created
many
new
painting
styles
such
as
classicism
romanticism
realism
and
impressionism
the
history
of
twentieth
century
art
includes
expressionism
fauvism
cubism
dadaism
surrealism
and
minimalism
in
some
societies
people
think
that
art
belongs
to
the
person
who
made
it
they
think
that
the
artist
put
his
or
her
talent
and
industry
into
the
art
in
this
view
the
art
is
the
property
of
the
artist
protected
by
copyright
in
other
societies
people
think
that
art
belongs
to
no
one
they
think
that
society
has
put
its
social
capital
into
the
artist
and
the
artist's
work
in
this
view
society
is
a
collective
that
has
made
the
art
through
the
artist
the
functions
of
art
include:
cognitive
function
works

let
us

about
what

humans
are
hosts
to
nearly
species
of
parasitic
worms
and
over
species
of
protozoa
some
derived
from
our
primate
ancestors
and
some
acquired
from
the
animals
we
have
domesticated
or
come
in
contact
with
during
our
relatively
short
history
on
earth
our
knowledge
of
parasitic
infections
extends
into
antiquity
when
the
above
definition
is
applied
many
organisms
which
eat
plants
can
be
seen
as
parasites
because
they
feed
largely
or
wholly
on
one
individual
plant
examples
would
include
many
herbivorous
insects:
the
hemiptera
or
true
bugs
leafhoppers
froghoppers
aphids
scale
insects
and
whiteflies
the
larvae
of
lepidoptera
usually
feed
and
mature
on
a
single
individual
of
the
host
plant
species
and
what
they
eat
accounts
for
most
of
the
food
for
their
complete
life
span
moreover
caterpillars
can
and
often
do
serious
damage
to
the
host's
foliage
other
orders
also
have
many
parasitic
herbivores:
thysanoptera
thrips
coleoptera
beetles
diptera
flies
parasites
of
larger
animals
account
for
much
research
done
for
veterinarian
and
medical
purposes
these
parasites
include
viruses
bacteria
protozoa
flatworms
flukes
and
tapeworms
nematodes
roundworms
arthropods
crustacea
insects
mites
parasitic
wasps
and
flies
are
of
great
interest
to
the
entomologist
and
may
be
used
in
biological
control
on
the
other
hand
many
blood-sucking
insects
such
as
mosquitoes
have
only
brief
contact
with
a
host
and
so
perhaps
should
not
be
regarded
as
parasites
pa
huge
number
of
species
are
parasitic
a
survey
of
the
feeding
habits
of
british
insects
showed
that
about
were
parasites
on
plants
and
slightly
more
were
parasites
on
animals
that
means
that
nearly
of
insects
in
britain
are
parasitic
since
british
insects
are
better
known
than
those
elsewhere
because
of
the
length
of
time
they
have
been
studied
this
means
that
the
majority
of
insect
species
throughout
the
world
are
parasitic
also
there
are
several
other
invertebrate
phyla
which
are
wholly
or
largely
parasitic
flatworms
and
roundworms
are
found
in
virtually
every
wild
species
of
vertebrate
protozoan
parasites
are
also
ubiquitous
hence
parasitism
is
almost
certainly
the
most
common
feeding
method
on
earth
it
is
clear
that
parasitism
as
a
way
of
life
is
more
common
than
all
other
feeding
strategies
combined
p
ectoparasites
live
on
the
outside
of
a
plant
or
animal
endoparasites
live
inside
a
plant
or
animal
intracellular
parasites
live
inside
cells
intercellular
parasites
live
in
the
spaces
between
cells
parasitoids
are
organisms
whose
larval
development
takes
place
within
another
organism's
body
resulting
in
the
death
of
the
host
there
are
twelve
superfamilies
of
wasps
which
are
entirely
or
mainly
parasitoid
such
as
the
ichneumonoid
wasps
whose
species
number
over
the
interaction
between
the
parasitoid
and
the
host
is
fundamentally
different
from
true
parasites
and
their
host
and
shares
some
characteristics
with
predation
a
vector
is
a
third
party
that
carries
the
parasite
to
the
host
thus
with
malaria
the
mosquito
is
the
vector
the
plasmodium
protozoan
is
the
parasite
and
the
mammal
is
the
host
the
mosquito
is
an
ectoparasite
as
well
as
a
vector
an
epiparasite
is
one
that
feeds
on
another
parasite
kleptoparasites
steal
food
from
other
species
brood
parasites
such
as
the
cuckoo
induce
other
species
to
raise
their
young
the
cowbird
is
another
brood
parasite
social
parasites
take
advantage
of
interactions
between
members
of
social
organisms
such
as
ants
or
termites
parasites
are
adapted
to
small
separated
habitats
for
a
parasite
each
host
is
an
island
surrounded
by
a
hostile
environment
for
a
small
organism
the
distances
between
hosts
or
groups
of
hosts
is
a
hazard
adaptations
to
bridge
this
hazard
are:
mass
production
of
spores
or
eggs
dispersal
of
fertile
females
dispersal
by
attaching
to
a
larger
organism
many
ectoparasites
extreme
longevity
of
resting
stages
spores
or
cysts
for
example
plant
parasitic
nematodes
may
remain
quiescent
for
years
parthenogenesis
and
inbreeding
among
offspring
of
a
single
female
are
common
in
parasites
so
parasites
exist
in
small
genetically
similar
groups
with
little
flow
of
genes
between
them
in
consequence
they
have
adaptations
to
solve
their
problems
of
dispersal
and
reproduction
parasites
face
an
environment
which
varies
in
time
and
space
consequently
both
local
geographic
races
and
polymorphism
occur
both
may
occur
in
the
same
species
parasites
are
very
specialised
feeders:
many
species
have
only
one
host
at
any
stage
of
their
life
cycle
a
few
use
more
than
two
host
species
many
parasites
have
complex
life-cycles
tremadodes
the
flukes
are
a
parasitic
class
of
flatworms
platyhelminths
with
over
species
most
of
them
infect
molluscs
in
the
first
part
of
the
life-cycle
and
vertebrates
in
the
second
part
the
biology
of
scrub
typhus
is
even
more
complex
it
involves
these
factors:
the
pathogen
bacterium
rickettsia
chiggers
which
are
ectoparasitic
mites
small
mammals
especially
rats
scrubby
vegetation
with
moist
conditions
humans
passing
through
patches
where
the
above
are
present
the
occurrence
of
all
these
factors
together
would
be
limited
in
space
and
brief
in
time
this
is
typical
of
the
ecology
of
parasitic
infections
both
evolutionary
rates
and
speciation
rates
can
be
high
sibling
species
are
very
common
in
the
bug
erythroneura
in
which
about
transfers
from
one
host
to
another
has
resulted
in
about
species
in
the
genus
the
clearest
evidence
comes
from
the
large
size
of
many
parasitic
families
even
though
some
parasitic
taxa
evolved
much
later
than
predatory
taxa
families
of
parasites
on
plants
are
on
average
almost
eight
times
larger
than
those
of
predators
and
families
of
parasites
on
animals
are
over
ten
times
larger
psometimes
there
is
good
evidence
of
the
speed
of
speciation
for
example
five
or
more
species
of
the
moth
hedylepta
must
have
evolved
within
years
in
hawaii
because
they
are
specific
to
banana
which
was
only
introduced
then
adaptive
radiation
in
parasites
is
extensive
its
development
in
each
taxon
group
depends
on:
the
diversity
of
the
hosts
how
many
species
there
are
in
the
group
being
parastised
and
how
different
they
are
from
each
other
the
size
of
the
host
target:
body
size
population
geographical
distribution
the
evolutionary
time
available
for
colonisation
of
hosts
the
selective
pressure
for
evolutionary
modification
diversity
of
hosts
is
a
big
factor
if
many
related
species
of
host
are
available
then
many
related
species
of
parasite
will
evolve
mites
on
lepidoptera
families
or
fleas
on
mammals
and
birds
are
good
examples
eichler's
rule
goes
as
follows:
when
a
large
group
of
hosts
consisting
of
a
wide
variety
of
species
is
compared
with
an
equivalent
group
consisting
of
few
representatives
the
larger
group
has
the
greater
diversity
of
parasitic
fauna
the
two
british
oaks
support
some
species
of
parasite
directly
and
indirectly
many
hundred
more
which
parasitise
these
parasites
it
would
certainly
be
an
underestimate
to
say
that
the
two
british
species
of
oak
are
the
primary
products
for
a
thousand
species
of
parasite
p
obviously
the
large
size
of
these
trees
is
a
factor
in
the
number
of
parasite
species
in
general
this
holds
whether
the
host
is
a
plant
or
an
animal
a
larger
bird
will
harbour
more
species
of
ectoparasite
than
a
small
bird
one
of
the
reasons
large
trees
have
so
many
parasites
is
that
they
may
have
lived
a
long
time
in
a
particular
area
compared
with
other
types
of
plant
they
have
had
longer
to
accumulate
parasites
parasites
can
be
most
useful
in
sorting
out
the
phylogenetic
relationships
of
their
hosts
sibling
host
species
have
been
discovered
when
their
parasites
diverged
common
ancestors
of
present-day
parasites
were
themselves
parasites
of
the
common
ancestors
of
present-day
hosts
as
the
host
evolves
defences
so
the
parasite
evolves
to
cope
with
this
this
is
co-evolution
consider
two
families
of
host
plants
the
umbellifers
fennel
cumin
parsley
hemlock
and
the
gramineae
grasses
the
umbellifers
have
many
aromatic
species
and
are
chemically
diverse
and
pharmaceutically
interesting
their
resins
and
oils
are
defences
against
herbivory
and
parasitism
on
the
other
hand
grasses
have
one
big
defence
to
herbivores:
their
stony
inclusions
in
their
cells
wear
down
the
teeth
of
herbivorous
mammals
but
they
have
few
chemical
defences
both
families
are
attacked
by
leaf-miner
flies
there
are
four
times
as
many
grass
species
as
there
are
umbellifers
but
there
are
twice
as
many
leaf-miner
species
on
the
umbellifers
this
is
apparently
because
the
chemical
diversity
of
potential
hosts
within
the
umbelliferae
has
forced
specialisation
of
the
parasites
eighty-two
percent
of
the
species
of
leaf-miner
attack
only
one
genus
each
this
is
speciation
which
does
not
require
geographical
isolation
ernst
mayr
the
chief
exponent
of
geographical
speciation
admitted
that
host
races
of
phytophagous
animals
constitute
the
only
known
case
indicating
the
possible
occurrence
of
incipient
sympatric
speciation
wikipedia
began
as
a
related
project
for
nupedia
nupedia
was
a
free
online
english-language

project
nupedia's
articles
were
written
and
owned
by
bomis
inc
which
is
a

company
the
main
people
of
the

were
jimmy
wales
the

and
larry
sanger
the

wales
is
credited
with
defining

sanger
created
the

larry
sanger
proposed
on

was
launched
on

it
was
launched
as
an

and
announced
by

on
the

wikipedia's
policy
of
neutral
point-of-view
was
codified
in
its
initial
months
and
was
similar
to
nupedia's
earlier
nonbiased
policy
otherwise
there
were
not
very
many
rules
initially
and
wikipedia
operated
independently
of
nupedia
wikipedia
gained
early
contributors
from
nupedia
slashdot
and
also
from
search
engines
it
grew
to
about
articles
and
languages
by
the
end
of
by
late
it
had
languages
by
the
end
of
and
by
the
end
of
nupedia
and
wikipedia
both
existed
until
nupedia's

were
stopped
in
after
this
its

was
incorporated
into

the

passed
the

making
it
the

ever
assembled
even
larger
than
the
yongle

which
had
held
the

years
the

the

the

to
honor
all
the

on
january
wikipedia
celebrated
its

it
used
a

in

from
these

one
can

anything

technology
to
manage
documents
has
developed
with
documents
themselves
of
particular
importances
are
practices
concerning
the
preservation
archival
destruction
and
management
of
documents
these
together
are
called
the
document
life
cycle
physical
preservation:
documents
in
both
traditional
physical
forms
and
in
digital
physical
forms
such
as
magnetic
media
must
be
physically
preserved
this
aspect
of
document
management
deals
with
such
issues
as
the
aging
of
paper
the
innovation
of
acid-free
paper
is
an
advance
in
preservation
and
obsolescence
of
magnetic
media
storage:
this
aspect
includes
management
of
scarce
resources
such
as
shelf
space
and
disk
space
and
associated
technologies
such
as
optimal
space
utilization
modern
libraries
such
as
the
university
of
nevada
and
the
university
of
michigan
often
use
complex
space-saving
technologies
such
as
robotic
retrieval
systems
for
stacks
and
moving
bookshelves
in
the
digital
realm
the
entire
discipline
of
compression
technologies
can
be
viewed
as
concerned
with
the
storage
of
documents
cultural
preservation:
this
function
traditionally
ascribed
to
librarians
involves
the
selection
arrangement
and
storage
of
documents
in
safe
places
the
importance
of
this
part
of
document
life
cycle
management
can
be
seen
in
the
impact
of
historical
events
such
as
the
burning
of
the
library
of
alexandria
today
library
and
information
science
has
developed
into
an
important
academic
discipline
bibliometrics:
this
aspect
of
document
management
involves
functions
of
indexing
generating
statistics
and
taxonomies
and
improving
the
usability
of
large
collections
of
documents
the
modern
history
of
this
management
technology
dates
back
to
melvil
dewey
and
the
dewey
decimal
system
today
the
science
of
bibliometrics
is
largely
concerned
with
managing
the
impact
of
electronic
technologies
this
aspect
must
also
deal
with
isbn
numbers
library
of
congress
data
and
other
standards
digital
content
management:
the
explosion
of
digital
content
has
resulted
in
technologies
to
manage
large
collections
of
digital
information
generated
by
organizations
such
systems
must
manage
access
control
and
privileges
multiple
electronic
format
interface
with
printing
infrastructures
and
enable
collaborative
workflows
around
documents
digital-physical
interaction
management:
as
long
as
both
paper
and
digital
documents
continue
to
have
value
the
modern
management
technologies
to
manage
their
interaction
will
continue
key
to
this
management
is
the
management
of
large
scale
and
systematic
scanning
of
physical
documents
such
as
the
google
book
scanning
project
destruction:
with
the
increased
cost
of
identity
theft
corporate
scandals
and
privacy
concerns
the
destruction
of
both
paper
and
electronic
documents
has
become
increasingly
important
to
manage
technologies
such
as
shredders
play
a
role
as
do
verifiable
processes
of
destruction
of
electronic
documents
to
ensure
compliance
with
privacy
laws
security:
shannon's
information
theory
has
led
to
an
entire
discipline
that
concerns
itself
with
the
security
of
documents
and
associated
technologies
such
as
encryption
as
well
as
more
physical
security
features
such
as
watermarks
and
making
currency
documents
safe
from
counterfeiting
transportation:
the
entire
postal
system
as
well
as
modern
courier
systems
is
largely
built
on
the
need
to
move
documents
physically
from
one
location
to
the
other
book
illuminated
manuscript
seal
device
typewriter
there
are
two
main
kinds
of
book
text:
fiction
and
non-fiction
these
books
are
novels
about
stories
that
did
not
happen
and
have
been
imagined
by
the
author
some
books
are
based
on
real
events
from
history
but
the
author
has
created
imaginary
characters
or
dialogue
for
the
events
books
of
non-fiction
are
about
true
facts
or
things
that
have
really
happened
some
examples
are
dictionaries
cookbooks
textbooks
for
learning
in
school
or
a
biography
someone's
life
story
between
the
written
manuscript
and
the
book
lie
several
inventions
manuscripts
are
hand-made
but
books
are
now
industrial
products
a
common
type
of
manuscript
was
the
scroll
which
was
a
long
sheet
rolled
up
the
sheet
could
have
been
made
of
papyrus
made
by
the
egyptians
by
weaving
the
inner
stems
of
the
papyrus
plant
and
then
hammering
them
together
or
parchment
or
vellum
very
thin
animal
skin
first
used
by
the
ancient
greeks
or
paper
made
from
plant
fibers
invented
by
the
chinese
manuscripts
of
this
kind
lasted
to
the
th
century
and
beyond
turning
the
manuscript
into
a
book
required
several
developments
the
romans
were
the
first
people
to
put
separate
pieces
of
manuscript
between
covers
to
form
a
codex
this
was
more
convenient
to
handle
and
store
than
scrolls
but
was
not
yet
a
book
as
we
understand
it
scrolls
and
codices
were
written
and
copied
by
hand
the
chinese
invented
woodblock
printing
where
shapes
are
carved
out
of
a
block
of
wood
then
ink
is
applied
to
the
carved
side
and
the
block
is
pressed
onto
paper
this
woodcut
method
was
slow
because
the
symbols
and
pictures
were
made
by
cutting
away
the
surrounding
wood
johannes
gutenberg
was
the
first
to
invent
a
machine
for
printing
the
printing
press
in
the
th
century
this
involved
more
than
just
a
press
it
involved
the
production
of
movable
metal
type
suitable
for
the
machine
process
initially
the
machines
were
slow
and
needed
a
printer
to
work
with
them
fast
and
automatic
machines
did
not
arrive
until
the
th
century
paper
had
been
invented
in
china
in
the
th
century
but
it
was
kept
secret
for
a
long
time
in
europe
hand-made
paper
was
available
from
about
it
was
expensive
and
the
early
printing
was
a
slow
process
therefore
books
remained
rare
in
the
first
machines
for
making
paper
from
wood
pulp
were
invented
new
kinds
of
inks
were
also
invented
for
various
purposes
and
machines
were
driven
by
steam
engines
and
later
by
electricity
the
common
cheap
supply
of
paper
fed
the
faster
printing
machines
and
books
became
cheaper
at
the
same
time
in
america
britain
and
continental
europe
more
people
learnt
to
read
so
in
the
th
century
many
ordinary
people
could
afford
to
buy
books
and
could
actually
read
them
also
in
the
th
century
came
public
libraries
so
poorer
people
could
get
access
to
the
best
books
printing
was
done
on
large
sheets
of
paper
which
were
then
folded
guillotined
cut
and
sewn
in
sections
and
finally
placed
into
the
covers
all
these
processes
were
done
by
machines
during
the
th
century
today
some
of
the
technologies
have
been
changed
especially
those
involving
illustration
and
typography
however
books
look
much
the
same
as
they
did
with
more
illustration
in
colour
but
basically
the
same
that
is
because
experience
has
shown
that
readers
need
certain
things
for
pleasurable
reading
graphic
design
and
typography
are
the
practical
arts
used
to
make
books
attractive
and
useful
to
readers
literature
reading
composition
music
the
word
“classic”
tends
to
mean:
an
art
which
is
so
good
that
it
will
always
be
enjoyed
by
future
generations
it
is
something
that
has
become
a
model
for
future
artists
the
period
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
is
known
as
the
classical
period
because
many
centuries
later
people
looked
back
to
those
ancient
civilizations
and
thought
they
were
perfect
in
recent
european
history
the
th
century
was
known
as
the
classical
period
because
musicians
artists
writers
and
philosophers
were
inspired
by
the
art
forms
of
the
classical
period
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
something
that
is
a
“classic”
is
therefore
something
that
will
always
be
remembered
as
something
great
famous
books
such
as
the
novels
of
charles
dickens
are
called
classics
“classical
music”
therefore
tends
to
mean
music
that
will
not
be
forgotten
soon
after
it
is
written
but
is
likely
to
be
enjoyed
by
many
future
generations
although
people
sometimes
think
of
classical
music
as
the
opposite
of
pop
music
it
can
still
be
very
popular
like
all
kinds
of
music
classical
music
can
be
in
many
different
moods:
happy
sad
scary
peaceful
thoughtful
simple
etc
mozart
wrote
his
serenades
and
divertimentos
to
entertain
people
at
parties
classical
pieces
of
music
can
be
quite
short
but
they
can
also
be
very
long
like
a
big
musical
story
a
symphony
by
mahler
or
shostakovich
can
last
for
nearly
an
hour
and
an
opera
is
a
whole
evening’s
entertainment
classical
music
is
also
different
from
jazz
because
true
jazz
is
improvised
however
the
differences
are
not
always
obvious
classical
music
has
often
been
inspired
by
jazz
and
jazz
by
classical
music
george
gershwin
wrote
music
which
is
both
jazz
and
classical
classical
music
too
can
be
improvised
the
great
composers
bach
mozart
and
beethoven
often
improvised
long
pieces
of
music
on
the
organ
harpsichord
or
piano
sometimes
they
wrote
these
improvistions
down
they
were
in
effect
compositions
which
were
composed
in
one
go
in
western
countries
a
vast
amount
of
music
was
written
for
christian
worship
in
churches
and
cathedrals
this
is
called
“sacred”
religious
music
all
other
music
is
“secular”
music
the
word
“secular”
means
things
that
are
not
sacred
sacred
and
secular
music
have
influenced
one
another
in
many
ways
during
the
course
of
music
history
secular
music
was
largely
influenced
by
dance
and
this
in
turn
changed
the
style
of
scared
music
for
example:
the
church
music
of
the
th
century
composer
giovanni
da
palestrina
has
nothing
to
do
with
dance
music
but
both
the
sacred
and
secular
music
of
johann
sebastian
bach
two
centuries
later
is
full
of
dance
rhythms
at
some
times
in
music
history
there
have
been
different
styles
of
composing
for
sacred
and
for
secular
music
claudio
monteverdi
uses
two
different
styles
for
his
church
and
for
his
non-church
music
when
composers
were
experimenting
with
new
ways
of
writing
music
they
usually
did
this
with
secular
music
and
sacred
music
caught
up
later
the
term
classical
music
was
not
used
until
the
early
th
century
people
then
started
talking
about
classical
music
in
order
to
praise
the
great
composers
such
as
bach
mozart
and
beethoven
in
the
th
century
many
different
ways
of
composing
were
used
including
music
played
by
electronic
instruments
or
very
modern
music
using
strange
sounds
experimental
or
avant
garde
music
for
example
the
music
of
john
cage
some
people
feel
that
this
kind
of
music
cannot
really
be
described
as
classical
music
classical
music
can
be
for
instruments
or
for
the
voice
the
symphony
orchestra
is
the
most
common
group
of
instruments
for
the
playing
of
classical
music
it
has
four
families
of
instruments:
the
string
instruments
which
include
the
violins
violas
cellos
and
piano
the
woodwind
instruments
which
include
flutes
oboesclarinets
and
bassoons
together
with
related
instruments
of
different
sizes
the
brass
instruments:
trumpet
trombone
tuba
and
french
horn
and
percussion
instruments
which
nearly
always
includes
timpani
as
well
as
many
other
possible
instruments
which
are
hit
or
shaken
this
is
very
different
from
a
typical
rock
band
which
has
a
drummer
a
guitarist
one
or
two
singers
and
an
electric
bass
and
keyboard
instruments
that
play
classical
music
are
not
normally
amplified
electronically
the
same
applies
to
the
voice
singers
may
be
sopranos
altos
tenors
or
basses
depending
on
their
vocal
range
their
voices
are
not
amplified
opera
singers
in
particular
have
to
develop
very
powerful
voices
which
will
be
heard
over
the
orchestra
and
project
right
to
the
back
of
an
opera
house
the
instruments
used
in
classical
music
developed
at
different
times
some
of
the
earliest
were
known
in
medieval
music
the
trombone
and
the
triangle
have
hardly
changed
for
hundreds
of
years
but
the
violin
family
developed
from
folk
instruments
such
as
fiddles
and
gradually
replaced
the
viols
to
form
the
basis
of
the
modern
orchestra
this
was
happening
by
the
beginning
of
the
th
century
which
was
the
time
when
opera
was
invented
in
general
musical
instruments
have
become
louder
as
concert
halls
have
become
bigger
violins
are
louder
than
viols
modern
violins
are
louder
than
the
early
th
century
violins
largely
because
of
they
have
metal
strings
instead
of
gut
strings
the
piano
developed
from
the
clavichord
which
was
very
quiet
indeed
woodwind
instruments
developed
from
renaissance
instruments
while
the
clarinet
was
invented
in
the
middle
of
the
th
century
and
the
saxophone
and
tuba
came
even
later
modern
trumpets
sound
much
brighter
than
the
straight
trumpets
of
the
th
century
most
popular
music
is
based
on
song
form
but
classical
music
has
many
different
forms
some
of
which
can
be
used
over
a
long
time
span
to
make
big
compositions
classical
music
can
have
many
forms
including
the
symphony
concerto
oratorio
opera
sonata
fugue
or
any
combination
of
dance
movements
such
as
suites
in
many
of
the
longer
compositions
short
tunes
are
developed
and
changed
during
the
course
of
the
piece
beethoven’s
fifth
symphony
is
a
good
example
of
a
piece
which
develops
from
just
four
notes
into
a
large
piece
lasting
about
half
an
hour
people
who
want
to
be
good
at
performing
classical
music
have
to
practice
hard
for
many
years
they
normally
have
formal
training
at
a
music
college
or
conservatoire
and
have
lessons
from
well-known
music
teachers
classical
musicians
often
spend
a
lot
of
time
thinking
carefully
about
pieces
of
music
especially
about
pieces
of
music
that
they
perform
they
study
such
things
as
harmony
and
counterpoint
to
help
them
understand
the
way
that
the
composers
were
thinking
when
they
put
the
piece
together
when
they
look
at
pieces
of
music
in
this
way
this
is
called
“musical
analysis”
people
who
specialize
in
thinking
and
writing
about
music
may
become
professors
or
lecturers
of
music
at
universities
classical
music
is
often
heard
in
popular
culture
it
is
used
as
background
music
for
movies
television
programs
advertisements
and
even
for
mobile
phone
ringing
tones
most
people
in
the
western
world
recognize
many
classical
tunes
possibly
without
even
realizing
it
some
classical
pieces
of
music
have
become
enormously
popular
e
g
the
song
nessun
dorma
from
giacomo
puccini's
opera
turandot
which
was
sung
by
the
three
tenors
luciano
pavarotti
plácido
domingo
and
josé
carreras
and
used
as
the
theme
tune
for
the
soccer
world
cup
this
made
many
people
who
had
never
been
interested
in
opera
start
to
become
curious
about
it
the
history
of
classical
music
really
started
in
the
late
middle
ages
music
written
for
the
church
was
almost
always
vocal
singing
because
instruments
were
thought
to
be
wicked
this
is
because
the
devil
played
them
and
because
they
were
used
for
dancing
there
was
a
lot
of
dance
music
but
most
of
it
is
lost
because
it
was
never
written
down
medieval
composers
who
are
remembered
today
include
léonin
pérotin
and
guillaume
de
machaut
the
renaissance
was
from
the
th
century
until
the
th
century
this
period
saw
a
massive
increase
in
the
composition
of
music
both
sacred
and
secular
many
great
cathedrals
had
been
built
in
europe
and
composers
wrote
music
for
them
mostly
vocal
music
secular
music
also
became
extremely
popular
especially
songs
and
madrigals
which
would
sometimes
be
accompanied
by
instruments
the
greatest
composers
of
this
period
include:
giovanni
da
palestrina
orlando
di
lasso
thomas
tallis
and
william
byrd
the
baroque
period
was
from
about
the
th
century
until
the
mid-th
century
this
was
the
time
when
the
modern
orchestra
was
formed
more
or
less
as
we
know
it
it
was
also
the
time
when
opera
was
invented
most
musicians
worked
either
for
the
church
or
for
rich
people
who
had
their
own
orchestras
many
of
them
also
started
to
work
for
opera
houses
the
greatest
composers
of
this
time
include:
claudio
monteverdi
heinrich
schütz
henry
purcell
antonio
vivaldi
george
frideric
handel
johann
sebastian
bach
domenico
scarlatti
and
georg
philipp
telemann
the
years
between
-
was
known
as
the
classical
period
composers
thought
a
lot
about
the
forms
of
their
pieces
and
were
influenced
by
the
classical
art
of
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
the
symphony
was
invented
and
various
forms
of
chamber
music
including
the
string
quartet
the
greatest
composers
include:
joseph
haydn
wolfgang
amadeus
mozart
christoph
willibald
gluch
and
ludwig
van
beethoven
from
to
was
known
as
the
romantic
period
composers
continued
to
use
the
forms
that
had
been
invented
in
the
th
century
but
they
also
thought
that
personal
feeling
and
emotion
were
very
important
music
for
orchestra
sometimes
told
a
story
programme
music
musicians
who
played
their
instruments
brilliantly
such
as
paganini
were
worshipped
like
heroes
beethoven
and
schubert
belong
in
many
ways
to
this
period
as
well
as
to
the
classical
period
it
was
a
time
when
there
were
a
lot
of
changes
in
society
after
the
wars
that
napoleon
had
waged
there
were
not
so
many
ruling
aristocratic
families
there
was
a
lot
of
feeling
of
nationalism
as
countries
united
th
century
music
is
often
nationalistic:
composers
wrote
music
that
was
typical
of
their
own
country
some
of
the
greatest
composers
include:
ludwig
van
beethoven
franz
schubert
hector
berlioz
frédéric
chopin
robert
schumann
felix
mendelssohn
anton
bruckner
johannes
brahms
pyotr
ilyich
tchaikovsky
edward
elgar
gustav
mahler
and
richard
strauss
what
is
known
as
th
century
classical
music
or
“modern
music”
is
music
from
about
onwards
at
this
time
many
composers
felt
that
everything
had
already
been
done
by
the
composers
of
the
past
so
they
wanted
to
find
new
ways
of
composing
claude
debussy
arnold
schoenberg
and
igor
stravinsky
in
particular
found
new
ways
of
writing
music
which
was
not
necessarily
tonal
in
any
particular
key
classical
music
was
influenced
by
jazz
especially
with
american
composers
later
in
the
century
people
such
as
pierre
boulez
and
karlheinz
stockhausen
experimented
in
many
other
ways
including
with
electronic
music
tape
recorders
etc
today’s
composers
have
combined
some
of
these
ideas
to
develop
their
own
styles
some
of
the
most
important
composers
are:
claude
debussy
jean
sibelius
maurice
ravel
arnold
schoenberg
igor
stravinsky
béla
bartók
aaron
copland
benjamin
britten
dmitri
shostakovich
leonard
bernstein
philip
glass
dmitri
kabalevsky
james
macmillan
judith
weir
peter
maxwell
davies
it
has
never
been
possible
to
say
exactly
what
is
meant
by
“classical
music”
many
different
kinds
of
music
influence
one
another
since
it
has
been
even
harder
to
make
clear
dividing
lines
between
rock
pop
classical
folk
jazz
and
world
music
this
shows
that
classical
music
like
other
kinds
of
music
continues
to
develop
and
reflect
the
society
from
which
it
comes
nocturne
a
computer
is
a
programmable
electronic
device
designed
to
accept
data
perform
prescribed
mathematical
and
logical
operations
at
high
speed
and
display
the
results
of
these
operations
all
under
the
control
of
software
mainframes
desktop
and
laptop
computers
tablets
and
smartphones
are
some
of
the
different
types
of
computers
an
electronic
machine
which
helps
in
solving
problems
quickly
and
easily
it
solves
problems
according
to
instructions
given
to
it
by
the
computer
user
called
programs
or
software
it
is
a
digital
machinethat
uses
binary
digits
used
in
all
fields
most
humans
have
a
problem
with
math
to
show
this
try
doing
×
in
your
head
it
is
hard
to
remember
all
the
steps
people
made
tools
to
help
them
remember
where
they
were
in
a
math
problem
the
other
problem
people
have
is
that
they
have
to
do
the
same
problem
over
and
over
and
over
again
a
cashier
had
to
make
change
every
day
in
her
head
or
with
a
piece
of
paper
that
took
a
lot
of
time
and
made
mistakes
so
people
made
calculators
that
did
those
same
things
over
and
over
this
part
of
computer
history
is
called
the
history
of
automated
calculation
which
is
a
fancy
phrase
for
the
history
of
machines
that
make
it
easy
for
me
to
do
this
same
maths
problem
over
and
over
without
making
mistakes
the
abacus
the
slide
rule
the
astrolabe
and
the
antikythera
mechanism
which
dates
from
about
-
bc
are
examples
of
automated
calculation
machines
people
do
not
want
a
machine
that
would
do
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
for
example
a
music
box
is
a
machine
that
plays
the
same
music
over
and
over
again
some
people
wanted
to
be
able
to
tell
their
machine
to
do
different
things
for
example
they
wanted
to
tell
the
music
box
to
play
different
music
every
time
they
wanted
to
be
able
to
program
the
music
box-
to
order
the
music
box
to
play
different
music
this
part
of
computer
history
is
called
the
history
of
programmable
machines
which
is
a
fancy
phrase
for
the
history
of
machines
that
i
can
order
to
do
different
things
if
i
know
how
to
speak
their
language
one
of
the
first
examples
of
this
was
built
by
hero
of
alexandria
c
–
ad
he
built
a
mechanical
theater
which
performed
a
play
lasting
minutes
and
was
operated
by
a
complex
system
of
ropes
and
drums
these
ropes
and
drums
were
the
language
of
the
machine-
they
told
what
the
machine
did
and
when
some
people
argue
that
this
is
the
first
programmable
machine
historians
disagree
on
which
early
machines
are
computers
many
say
the
castle
clock
an
astronomical
clock
invented
by
al-jazari
in
is
the
first
known
programmable
analog
computer
the
length
of
day
and
night
could
be
adjusted
every
day
in
order
to
account
for
the
changing
lengths
of
day
and
night
throughout
the
year
some
count
this
daily
adjustment
as
computer
programming
others
say
the
first
computer
was
made
by
charles
babbage
ada
lovelace
is
considered
to
be
the
first
programmer
at
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
people
in
europe
thought
math
and
engineering
were
more
important
in
wilhelm
schickard
made
a
mechanical
calculator
other
europeans
made
more
calculators
after
him
they
were
not
modern
computers
because
they
could
only
add
subtract
and
multiply-
you
could
not
change
what
they
did
to
make
them
do
something
like
play
tetris
because
of
this
we
say
they
were
not
programmable
now
engineers
use
computers
to
design
and
plan
in
joseph
marie
jacquard
used
punched
paper
cards
to
tell
his
textile
loom
what
kind
of
pattern
to
weave
he
could
use
punch
cards
to
tell
the
loom
what
to
do
and
he
could
change
the
punch
cards
which
means
he
could
program
the
loom
to
weave
the
pattern
he
wanted
this
means
the
loom
was
programmable
charles
babbage
wanted
to
make
a
similar
machine
that
could
calculate
he
called
it
the
analytical
engine
because
babbage
did
not
have
enough
money
and
always
changed
his
design
when
he
had
a
better
idea
he
never
built
his
analytical
engine
as
time
went
on
computers
were
used
more
people
get
bored
easily
doing
the
same
thing
over
and
over
imagine
spending
your
life
writing
things
down
on
index
cards
storing
them
and
then
having
to
go
find
them
again
the
census
bureau
in
had
hundreds
of
people
doing
just
that
it
was
expensive
and
reports
took
a
long
time
then
an
engineer
worked
out
how
to
make
machines
do
a
lot
of
the
work
herman
hollerith
invented
a
tabulating
machine
that
would
automatically
add
up
information
that
the
census
bureau
collected
the
computing
tabulating
recording
corporation
which
later
became
ibm
made
his
machines
they
leased
the
machines
instead
of
selling
them
makers
of
machines
had
long
helped
their
users
understand
and
repair
them
and
ctr's
tech
support
was
especially
good
because
of
machines
like
this
new
ways
of
talking
to
these
machines
were
invented
and
new
types
of
machines
were
invented
and
eventually
the
computer
as
we
know
it
was
born
in
the
first
half
of
the
th
century
scientists
started
using
computers
mostly
because
scientists
had
a
lot
of
math
to
figure
out
and
wanted
to
spend
more
of
their
time
thinking
about
science
questions
instead
of
spending
hours
adding
numbers
together
for
example
if
they
had
to
launch
a
rocket
ship
they
needed
to
do
a
lot
of
math
to
make
sure
the
rocket
worked
right
so
they
put
together
computers
these
analog
computers
used
analog
circuits
which
made
them
very
hard
to
program
in
the
they
invented
digital
computers
and
soon
made
them
easier
to
program
however
this
is
not
the
case
as
many
consecutive
attempts
have
been
made
to
bring
arithmetic
logic
to
l
analogue
computers
are
mechanical
or
electronic
devices
which
solve
problems
some
are
used
to
control
machines
scientists
figured
out
how
to
make
and
use
digital
computers
in
the
and
scientists
made
a
lot
of
digital
computers
and
as
they
did
they
figured
out
how
to
ask
them
the
right
sorts
of
questions
to
get
the
most
out
of
them
here
are
a
few
of
the
computers
they
built:
konrad
zuse's
electromechanical
z
machines
the
z
was
the
first
working
machine
that
used
binary
arithmetic
binary
arithmetic
means
using
yes
and
no
to
add
numbers
together
you
could
also
program
it
in
the
z
was
proved
to
be
turing
complete
turing
complete
means
that
it
is
possible
to
tell
this
particular
computer
anything
that
it
is
mathematically
possible
to
tell
a
computer
it
is
the
world's
first
modern
computer
the
non-programmable
atanasoff–berry
computer
which
used
vacuum
tubes
to
store
yes
and
no
answers
and
regenerative
capacitor
memory
the
harvard
mark
i
a
big
computer
that
you
could
kind
of
program
the
army's
ballistics
research
laboratory
eniac
which
could
add
numbers
the
way
people
do
using
the
numbers
through
and
is
sometimes
called
the
first
general
purpose
electronic
computer
since
konrad
zuse's
z
of
used
electromagnets
instead
of
electronics
at
first
however
the
only
way
to
reprogram
eniac
was
by
rewiring
it
several
developers
of
eniac
saw
its
problems
they
invented
a
way
to
for
a
computer
to
remember
what
they
had
told
it
and
a
way
to
change
what
it
remembered
this
is
known
as
stored
program
architecture
or
von
neumann
architecture
john
von
neumann
talked
about
this
design
in
the
paper
first
draft
of
a
report
on
the
edvac
distributed
in
a
number
of
projects
to
develop
computers
based
on
the
stored-program
architecture
started
around
this
time
the
first
of
these
was
completed
in
great
britain
the
first
to
be
demonstrated
working
was
the
manchester
small-scale
experimental
machine
ssem
or
baby
while
the
edsac
completed
a
year
after
ssem
was
the
first
really
useful
computer
that
used
the
stored
program
design
shortly
afterwards
the
machine
originally
described
by
von
neumann's
paper—edvac—was
completed
but
was
not
ready
for
two
years
nearly
all
modern
computers
use
the
stored-program
architecture
it
has
become
the
main
concept
which
defines
a
modern
computer
the
technologies
used
to
build
computers
have
changed
since
the
but
many
current
computers
still
use
the
von-neumann
architecture
in
the
computers
were
built
out
of
mostly
vacuum
tubes
transistors
replaced
vacuum
tubes
in
the
because
they
were
smaller
and
cheaper
they
also
need
less
power
and
do
not
break
down
as
much
as
vacuum
tubes
in
the
technologies
were
based
on
integrated
circuits
microprocessors
such
as
the
intel
made
computers
smaller
cheaper
faster
and
more
reliable
by
the
microcontrollers
became
small
and
cheap
enough
to
replace
mechanical
controls
in
things
like
washing
machines
the
also
saw
home
computers
and
personal
computers
with
the
evolution
of
the
internet
personal
computers
are
becoming
as
common
as
the
television
and
the
telephone
in
the
household
in
nokia
started
to
call
some
of
its
mobile
phones
the
n-series
multimedia
computers
and
after
the
launch
of
the
apple
iphone
in
many
are
now
starting
to
add
the
smartphone
category
among
real
computers
in
if
smartphones
are
included
in
the
numbers
of
computers
in
the
world
the
biggest
computer
maker
by
units
sold
was
no
longer
hewlett-packard
but
rather
nokia
there
are
many
types
of
computers:
personal
computer
workstation
computer
mainframe
computer
minicomputer
supercomputer
embedded
system
tablet
computera
desktop
computer
is
a
small
machine
that
has
a
screen
which
is
not
part
of
the
computer
most
people
keep
them
on
top
of
a
desk
which
is
why
they
are
called
desktop
computers
laptop
computers
are
computers
small
enough
to
fit
on
your
lap
this
makes
them
easy
to
carry
around
both
laptops
and
desktops
are
called
personal
computers
because
one
person
at
a
time
uses
them
for
things
like
playing
music
surfing
the
web
or
playing
video
games
there
are
bigger
computers
that
many
people
at
a
time
can
use
these
are
called
mainframes
and
these
computers
do
all
the
things
that
make
things
like
the
internet
work
you
can
think
of
a
personal
computer
like
this:
the
personal
computer
is
like
your
skin:
you
can
see
it
other
people
can
see
it
and
through
your
skin
you
feel
wind
water
air
and
the
rest
of
the
world
a
mainframe
is
more
like
your
internal
organs:
you
never
see
them
and
you
barely
even
think
about
them
but
if
they
suddenly
went
missing
you
would
have
some
very
big
problems
an
embedded
computer
also
called
embedded
system
is
a
computer
that
does
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
and
usually
does
it
very
well
for
example
an
alarm
clock
is
an
embedded
computer:
it
tells
the
time
unlike
your
personal
computer
you
cannot
use
your
clock
to
play
tetris
because
of
this
we
say
that
embedded
computers
cannot
be
programmed
because
you
cannot
install
more
programs
on
your
clock
some
mobile
phones
automatic
teller
machines
microwave
ovens
cd
players
and
cars
are
operated
by
embedded
computers
all-in-one
computers
are
desktop
computers
that
have
all
of
the
computer's
inner
mechanisms
in
the
same
case
as
the
monitor
apple
has
made
several
popular
examples
of
all-in-one
computers
such
as
the
original
macintosh
of
the
mid-s
and
the
imac
of
the
late
and
playing
computer
games
writing
solving
mathematics
looking
for
things
on
the
internet
watching
tv
and
movies
listening
to
music
communicating
with
other
people
downloading
sending
e-mail
using
internet
recording
calculating
editing
video
photo
taking
pictures
photography
drawing
study
purposes
word
processing
spreadsheets
excel
powerpoint
presentations
photo
editing
photoshop
gimp
e-mail
video
editing/rendering/encoding
audio
recording
system
management
computers
store
data
and
the
instructions
as
numbers
because
computers
can
do
things
with
numbers
very
quickly
these
data
are
stored
as
binary
symbols
and
a
or
a
symbol
stored
by
a
computer
is
called
a
bit
which
comes
from
the
words
binary
digit
computers
can
use
many
bits
together
to
represent
instructions
and
the
data
that
these
instructions
use
a
list
of
instructions
is
called
a
program
and
is
stored
on
the
computer's
hard
disk
computers
work
through
the
program
by
using
a
central
processing
unit
and
they
use
fast
memory
called
ram
as
a
space
to
store
the
instructions
and
data
while
they
are
doing
this
when
the
computer
wants
to
store
the
results
of
the
program
for
later
it
uses
the
hard
disk
because
things
stored
on
a
hard
disk
can
still
be
remembered
after
the
computer
is
turned
off
an
operating
system
tells
the
computer
how
to
understand
what
jobs
it
has
to
do
how
to
do
these
jobs
and
how
to
tell
people
the
results
millions
of
computers
may
be
using
the
same
operating
system
while
each
computer
can
have
its
own
application
programs
to
do
what
its
user
needs
using
the
same
operating
systems
makes
it
easy
to
learn
how
to
use
computers
for
new
things
a
user
who
needs
to
use
a
computer
for
something
different
can
learn
how
to
use
a
new
application
program
some
operating
systems
can
have
simple
command
lines
or
a
fully
user-frendly
gui
one
of
the
most
important
jobs
that
computers
do
for
people
is
helping
with
communication
communication
is
how
people
share
information
computers
have
helped
people
move
forward
in
science
medicine
business
and
learning
because
they
let
experts
from
anywhere
in
the
world
work
with
each
other
and
share
information
they
also
let
other
people
communicate
with
each
other
do
their
jobs
almost
anywhere
learn
about
almost
anything
or
share
their
opinions
with
each
other
the
internet
is
the
thing
that
lets
people
communicate
between
their
computers
a
computer
is
now
almost
always
an
electronic
device
it
usually
contains
materials
that
will
become
electronic
waste
when
discarded
when
a
new
computer
is
bought
in
some
places
laws
require
that
the
cost
of
its
waste
management
must
also
be
paid
for
this
is
called
product
stewardship
computers
can
become
obsolete
quickly
depending
on
what
programs
the
user
runs
very
often
they
are
thrown
away
within
two
or
three
years
because
some
newer
programs
require
a
more
powerful
computer
this
makes
the
problem
worse
so
computer
recycling
happens
a
lot
many
projects
try
to
send
working
computers
to
developing
nations
so
they
can
be
re-used
and
will
not
become
waste
as
quickly
as
most
people
do
not
need
to
run
new
programs
some
computer
parts
such
as
hard
drives
can
break
easily
when
these
parts
end
up
in
the
landfill
they
can
put
poisonous
chemicals
like
lead
into
the
ground
water
hard
drives
can
also
contain
secret
information
like
credit
card
numbers
if
the
hard
drive
is
not
erased
before
being
thrown
away
an
identity
thief
can
get
the
information
from
the
hard
drive
even
if
the
drive
doesn't
work
and
use
it
to
steal
money
from
the
previous
owner's
bank
account
computers
come
in
different
forms
but
most
of
them
have
a
common
design
all
computers
have
a
cpu
all
computers
have
some
kind
of
data
bus
which
lets
them
get
inputs
or
output
things
to
the
environment
all
computers
have
some
form
of
memory
these
are
usually
chips
integrated
circuits
which
can
hold
information
many
computers
have
some
kind
of
sensors
which
lets
them
get
input
from
their
environment
many
computers
have
some
kind
of
display
device
which
lets
them
show
output
they
may
also
have
other
peripheral
devices
connected
a
computer
has
several
main
parts
when
comparing
a
computer
to
a
human
body
the
cpu
is
like
a
brain
it
does
most
of
the
'thinking'
and
tells
the
rest
of
the
computer
how
to
work
the
cpu
is
on
the
motherboard
which
is
like
the
skeleton
it
provides
the
basis
for
where
the
other
parts
go
and
carries
the
nerves
that
connect
them
to
each
other
and
the
cpu
the
motherboard
is
connected
to
a
power
supply
which
provides
electricity
to
the
entire
computer
the
various
drives
cd
drive
floppy
drive
and
on
many
newer
computers
usb
flash
drive
act
like
eyes
ears
and
fingers
and
allow
the
computer
to
read
different
types
of
storage
in
the
same
way
that
a
human
can
read
different
types
of
books
the
hard
drive
is
like
a
human's
memory
and
keeps
track
of
all
the
data
stored
on
the
computer
most
computers
have
a
sound
card
or
another
method
of
making
sound
which
is
like
vocal
cords
or
a
voice
box
connected
to
the
sound
card
are
speakers
which
are
like
a
mouth
and
are
where
the
sound
comes
out
computers
might
also
have
a
graphics
card
which
helps
the
computer
to
create
visual
effects
such
as
d
environments
or
more
realistic
colors
and
more
powerful
graphics
cards
can
make
more
realistic
or
more
advanced
images
in
the
same
way
a
well
trained
artist
can
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
elected
by
the
electoral
college
some
other
countries
choose
a
president
this
way
in
some
the
parliament
does
it
some
countries
have
direct
elections
to
choose
a
president
many
countries
have
a
monarch
instead
of
a
president
and
some
have
neither
companies
have
presidents
they
are
elected
by
the
people
who
own
part
of
the
company
in
some
companies
the
people
who
are
workers
for
the
company
elect
vote
for
their
company
president
the
president
of
a
country
is
not
the
same
thing
as
a
prime
minister
a
prime
minister
is
part
of
a
parliament
but
a
president
is
not
in
some
countries
such
as
the
united
states
or
france
the
president
has
more
power
and
responsibility
than
anyone
else
such
a
president
is
often
called
the
nation's
chief
executive
as
chief
executive
the
president
must
take
an
active
role
in
all
phases
of
government
in
other
countries
such
as
the
republic
of
ireland
or
israel
to
be
president
is
more
of
an
honor
or
a
symbol
and
the
position
has
no
real
power
this
kind
of
president
is
often
called
head
of
state
most
countries
that
have
a
king
or
queen
as
their
monarch
have
no
president
the
american
president
is
restricted
by
the
written
united
states
constitution
which
can
be
changed
but
only
if
two-thirds
of
congress
as
well
as
the
president
and
three-fourths
of
the
states
agree
to
it
the
american
constitution
was
created
to
make
sure
that
the
american
executive
never
became
as
powerful
as
the
british
system
it
had
broken
away
from
the
british
prime
minister
is
part
of
both
the
legislature
and
executive
whereas
the
american
president
is
the
head
of
the
executive
the
american
governmental
system
shows
a
clear
separation
of
powers
unlike
the
british
system
all
the
president's
ministerial
appointments
have
to
be
vetted
by
congress
parliament
and
congress
may
have
an
opposition
majority
the
president
does
not
have
the
ability
to
introduce
and
influence
legislation
in
the
same
way
as
the
british
prime
minister
congress
has
much
greater
control
over
the
budget
and
foreign
policy
than
the
british
parliament
there
are
broad
areas
of
american
life
such
as
education
crime
and
punishment
over
which
the
president
has
virtually
no
influence
at
all
the
president
even
has
very
limited
control
over
the
economy
so
despite
having
a
large
nuclear
arsenal
the
american
president
can
not
carry
out
policy
and
introduce
legislation
as
freely
as
the
british
prime
minister
monarch
contract
law
sets
rules
on
agreements
to
buy
and
sell
items
and
services
medical
law
sets
rules
and
guidelines
for
medical
professionals
it
also
states
a
patient's
own
medical
rights
physician-patient
privilege
protects
the
patient's
private
conversations
with
a
medical
physician
doctor
this
also
extends
to
their
personal
information
like
their
contact
details
shared
with
medical
personnel
property
law
states
the
rights
and
obligations
that
a
person
has
when
they
buy
sell
or
rent
homes
and
land
called
real
property
or

ip
law
involves
the
rights
people
have
over
things
they
create
such
as
art
music
and
literature
this
is
called
copyright
it
also
protects
inventions
that
people
make
by
a
kind
of
law
called
patent
it
also
covers
the
rights
people
have
to
the
names
of
a
company
or
a
distinctive
mark
or
logo
this
is
called
trademark
trust
law
business
law
sets
out
the
rules
for
money
that
is
put
into
an
investment
such
as
pension
funds
that
people
save
up
for
their
retirement
it
involves
many
different
types
of
law
including
administrative
and
property
law
tort
law
helps
people
to
make
claims
for
compensation
repayment
when
someone
hurts
them
or
hurts
their
property
criminal
law
is
used
by
the
government
to
prevent
people
from
breaking
laws
and
punish
people
who
do
break
them
constitutional
law
deals
with
the
important
rights
of
the
government
and
its
relationship
with
the
people
it
mainly
involves
the
interpretation
of
a
constitution
including
things
like
the
separation
of
powers
of
the
different
branches
of
government
a
court
order
is
an
official
proclamation
by
a
judge
that
defines
and
authorizes
the
carrying
out
of
certain
steps
for
one
or
more
parties
to
a
case
administrative
law
is
used
by
ordinary
citizens
who
want
to
challenge
decisions
made
by
governments
it
also
involves
things
like
regulations
and
the
operation
of
the
administrative
agencies
international
law
is
used
to
set
out
rules
on
how
countries
can
act
in
areas
such
as
trade
the
environment
or
military
action
the
geneva
conventions
on
the
conduct
of
war
and
the
roerich
pact
are
examples
of
international
law
custom
and
tradition
are
practices
that
are
widely
adopted
and
agreed
upon
in
a
society
thought
often
not
in
a
written
form
custom
and
tradition
can
be
enforced
in
courts
and
are
sometimes
considered
as
part
of
the
legal
reasoning
in
matters
decided
in
courts
in
some
societies
and
cultures
all
law
is
or
was
custom
and
tradition
though
this
is
increasingly
rare
although
there
are
some
parts
of
the
world
where
custom
tradition
are
still
binding
or
even
the
predominant
form
of
law
for
example
tribal
lands
or
failed
states
civil
law
is
the
legal
system
used
in
most
countries
around
the
world
today
civil
law
is
based
on
legislation
that
is
found
in
constitutions
or
statutes
passed
by
government
the
secondary
part
of
civil
law
is
the
legal
approaches
that
are
part
of
custom
in
civil
law
governments
judges
do
not
generally
have
much
power
and
most
of
the
laws
and
legal
precedent
are
created
by
members
of
parliament
common
law
is
based
on
the
decisions
made
by
judges
in
past
court
cases
it
comes
from
england
and
it
became
part
of
almost
every
country
that
once
belonged
to
the
british
empire
except
malta
scotland
the
state
of
louisiana
and
the
canadian
province
of
quebec
it
is
also
the
predominant
form
of
law
in
the
united
states
where
many
laws
called
statutes
are
written
by
congress
but
many
more
legal
rules
exist
from
the
decisions
of
the
courts
common
law
had
its
beginnings
in
the
middle
ages
when
king
john
was
forced
by
his
barons
to
sign
a
document
called
the
magna
carta
religious
law
is
law
based
on
religious
beliefs
or
books
examples
include
the
jewish
halakha
islamic
sharia
and
christian
canon
law
until
the
sharia
law
was
the
main
legal
system
throughout
the
muslim
world
in
some
muslim
countries
such
as
saudi
arabia
and
iran
the
whole
legal
systems
still
base
their
law
on
sharia
law
islamic
law
is
often
criticised
because
it
often
has
harsh
penalties
for
crimes
a
serious
criticism
is
the
judgement
of
the
european
court
that
sharia
is
incompatible
with
the
fundamental
principles
of
democracy
the
turkish
refah
party's
sharia-based
plurality
of
legal
systems
grounded
on
religion
was
ruled
to
contravene
the
european
convention
for
the
protection
of
human
rights
and
fundamental
freedoms
the
court
decided
refah's
plan
would
do
away
with
the
state's
role
as
the
guarantor
of
individual
rights
and
freedoms
and
infringe
the
principle
of
non-discrimination
between
individuals
as
regards
their
enjoyment
of
public
freedoms
which
is
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
democracy
the
history
of
law
is
closely
connected
to
the
development
of
human
civilizations
ancient
egyptian
law
developed
in
bc
in
bc
king
hammurabi
took
ancient
babylonian
law
and
organized
it
and
had
it
chiseled
in
stone
for
the
public
to
see
in
the
marketplace
these
laws
became
known
as
the
code
of
hammurabi
the
torah
from
the
old
testament
is
an
old
body
of
law
it
was
written
around
bc
it
has
moral
rules
such
as
the
ten
commandments
which
tell
people
what
things
are
not
permitted
sometimes
people
try
to
change
the
law
for
example
if
prostitution
is
illegal
they
try
to
make
it
legal
in
democracies
the
people
in
a
country
usually
choose
people
called
politicians
to
represent
them
in
a
legislature
examples
of
legislatures
include
the
houses
of
parliament
in
london
the
congress
in
washington
d
c
the
bundestag
in
berlin
the
duma
in
moscow
and
the
assemblée
nationale
in
paris
most
legislatures
have
two
chambers
or
houses
a
'lower
house'
and
an
'upper
house'
to
pass
legislation
a
majority
of
members
of
parliament
must
vote
for
a
bill
in
each
house
the
legislature
is
the
branch
of
government
that
writes
laws
and
votes
on
whether
they
will
be
approved
the
judiciary
is
a
group
of
judges
who
resolve
people's
disputes
and
determine
whether
people
who
are
charged
with
crimes
are
guilty
in
some
jurisdictions
the
judge
does
not
find
guilt
or
innocence
but
instead
directs
a
jury
how
to
interpret
facts
from
a
legal
perspective
but
the
jury
determines
the
facts
based
on
evidence
presented
to
them
and
finds
the
guilt
or
innocences
of
the
charged
person
most
countries
of
common
law
and
civil
law
systems
have
a
system
of
appeals
courts
up
to
a
supreme
authority
such
as
the
supreme
court
or
the
high
court
the
highest
courts
usually
have
the
power
to
remove
laws
that
are
unconstitutional
which
go
against
the
constitution
the
executive
is
the
governing
center
of
political
authority
in
most
democratic
countries
the
executive
is
elected
from
people
who
are
in
the
legislature
this
group
of
elected
people
is
called
the
cabinet
in
france
the
us
and
russia
the
executive
branch
has
a
president
which
exists
separately
from
the
legislature
the
executive
suggests
new
laws
and
deals
with
other
countries
as
well
the
executive
usually
controls
the
military
the
police
and
the
bureaucracy
the
executive
selects
ministers
or
secretaries
of
state
to
control
departments
such
as
the
health
department
or
the
department
of
justice
in
many
jurisdictions
the
head
of
state
does
not
take
part
in
the
day-to-day
governance
of
the
jurisdiction
and
takes
a
largely
ceremonial
role
this
is
the
case
in
many
commonwealth
nations
where
the
head
of
state
usually
a
governor
almost
exclusively
acts
on
the
advice
of
the
head
of
the
executive
e
g
the
prime
minister
first
minister
or
premier
the
primary
legal
role
of
the
head
of
state
in
these
jurisdictions
is
to
act
as
a
check
or
balance
against
the
executive
as
the
head
of
state
has
the
rarely
exercised
power
to
dissolve
the
legislature
call
elections
and
dismiss
ministers
the
police
enforce
the
criminal
laws
by
arresting
people
suspected
of
breaking
the
law
bureaucrats
are
the
government
workers
and
government
organizations
that
do
work
for
the
government
bureaucrats
work
within
a
system
of
rules
and
they
make
their
decisions
in
writing
lawyers
are
people
who
have
learned
about
laws
lawyers
give
people
advice
about
their
legal
rights
and
duties
and
represent
people
in
court
to
become
a
lawyer
a
person
has
to
complete
a
two-
or
three-year
university
program
at
a
law
school
and
pass
an
entrance
examination
lawyers
work
in
law
firms
for
the
government
for
companies
or
by
themselves
civil
society
is
the
people
and
groups
that
are
not
part
of
government
that
try
to
protect
people
against
human
rights
abuses
and
try
to
protect
freedom
of
speech
and
other
individual
rights
organizations
that
are
part
of
civil
society
include
political
parties
debating
clubs
trade
unions
human

organizations
newspapers
and
charities
corporations
are
among
the
organizations
that
use
the
legal
system
to
further
their
goals
like
the
others
they
use
means
such
as
campaign
donations
and
advertising
to
persuade
people
that
they
are
right
corporations
also
engage
in
commerce
and
make
new
things
such
as
automobiles
vaporisers/e-cigarettes
and
unmanned
aerial
vehicles
i
e
drones
that
the
old
laws
are
not
well
equipped
to
deal
with
corporations
also
makes
use
of
a
set
of
rules
and
regulations
to
ensure
their
employees
remain
loyal
to
them
usually
presented
in
a
legal
contract
and
that
any
disobedience
towards
these
rules
are
considered
uncivilized
and
therefore
given
grounds
for
immediate

plato
listed
five
kinds
of
government
in
the
republic:
the
most
common
type
of
government
in
the
western
world
is
called
democracy
in
democracies
people
in
a
country
can
vote
during
elections
for
representatives
or
political
parties
that
they
prefer
the
people
in
democracies
can
elect
representatives
who
will
sit
on
legislatures
such
as
the
parliament
or
congress
political
parties
are
organizations
of
people
with
similar
ideas
about
how
a
country
or
region
should
be
governed
different
political
parties
have
different
ideas
about
how
the
government
should
handle
different
problems
democracy
is
the
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
and
for
the
people
however
many
countries
have
forms
of
democracy
which
limit
freedom
of
choice
by
the
voters
one
of
the
most
common
ways
is
to
limit
which
parties
who
can
for
parliament
or
limit
the
parties
access
to
mass
media
such
as
television
another
way
is
to
rig
the
voting
system
by
removing
votes
from
opposition
voters
and
substituting
votes
for
the
party
in
power
few
countries
are
textbook
democracies
and
the
differences
between
them
has
been
much
studied
a
monarchy
is
a
government
ruled
by
a
king
or
a
queen
who
inherits
their
position
from
their
family
which
is
often
called
the
royal
family
there
are
two
types
of
monarchies:
absolute
monarchies
and
constitutional
monarchies
in
an
absolute
monarchy
the
ruler
has
no
limits
on
their
wishes
or
powers
in
a
constitutional
monarchy
a
ruler's
powers
are
limited
by
a
document
called
a
constitution
in
modern
times
monarchies
still
exist
in
great
britain
and
the
commonwealth
the
netherlands
spain
japan
saudi
arabia
and
thailand
along
with
several
other
countries
a
monarch
may
have
one
of
several
titles:
king
or
queen
emperor
or
empress
or
emir
an
aristocracy
is
a
government
by
the
best
people
usually
people
who
come
from
wealthy
families
families
with
a
particular
set
of
values
or
people
who
come
from
a
particular
place
a
person
who
rules
in
an
aristocracy
is
an
aristocrat
aristocracy
is
different
from
nobility
in
that
nobility
means
that
one
bloodline
would
rule
an
aristocracy
would
mean
that
a
few
or
many
bloodlines
would
rule
or
that
rulers
be
chosen
in
a
different
manner
under
a
dictatorship
the
government
is
run
by
one
person
who
has
all
the
power
over
the
people
in
a
country
originally
the
roman
republic
made
dictators
to
lead
during
time
of
war
the
roman
dictators
and
greek
tyrants
were
not
always
cruel
or
unkind
but
they
did
hold
on
to
power
all
by
themselves
rather
than
sharing
power
with
the
people
the
roman
dictators
only
held
power
for
a
short
period
of
time
in
modern
times
a
dictator's
rule
is
not
stopped
by
any
laws
constitutions
or
other
social
and
political
institutions
and
can
last
many
years
or
even
decades
after
world
war
ii
many
governments
in
latin
america
asia
and
africa
were
ruled
by
dictators
examples
of
dictators
include
josef
stalin
adolf
hitler
augusto
pinochet
idi
amin
muammar
al-qaddafi
and
gamal
abdul
nasser
the
rules
of
these
dictators
continued
from
when
they
took
power
until
when
they
died
because
they
would
not
allow
any
other
person
or
law
to
take
power
from
them
there
is
no
evidence
of
a
woman
serving
as
a
dictator
in
modern
times
an
oligarchy
is
a
government
ruled
by
a
small
group
of
powerful
people
these
people
may
spread
power
equally
or
not
equally
an
oligarchy
is
different
from
a
true
democracy
because
very
few
people
are
given
the
chance
to
change
things
an
oligarchy
does
not
have
to
be
hereditary
or
passed
down
from
father
to
son
an
oligarchy
does
not
have
one
clear
ruler
but
several
powerful
people
some
past
examples
of
oligarchy
are
the
former
union
of
soviet
socialist
republics
and
apartheid
south
africa
a
fictional
example
is
the
dystopian
society
of
oceania
in
the
book
nineteen
eighty-four
some
critics
of
representative
democracy
think
of
the
united
states
as
an
oligarchy
this
view
is
shared
by
anarchists
the
simplest
idea
of
government
is
those
who
rule
over
people
and
land
this
may
be
as
small
as
a
community
or
village
or
as
big
as
a
continent
like
australia
and
india
the
people
who
rule
can
allow
others
to
own
land
it
is
a
deed
by
government
that
gives
this
right
in
the
way
that
laws
describe
some
think
they
have
the
right
to
hold
land
without
government
permission
this
view
is
called
libertarianism
others
think
they
can
do
without
government
this
view
is
called
anarchism
almost
every
place
on
earth
is
connected
to
one
and
only
one
government
places
without
government
are
where
people
follow
traditions
instead
of
government
rules
small
border
disputed
areas
and
the
continent
of
antarctica
because
almost
no
people
live
there
for
every
other
place
on
earth
there
is
a
government
that
claims
'sovereign
control'
over
it
the
word
sovereign
is
old
and
means
control
by
a
king
sovereign
governments
of
villages
cities
counties
and
other
communities
are
subordinate
to
the
government
of
the
state
or
province
where
they
exist
and
then
to
that
of
the
country
it
is
from
kings
and
feudalism
that
modern
governments
and
nation
states
came
the
capital
of
a
country
for
instance
is
where
the
king
kept
his
assets
from
this
we
get
the
modern
idea
of
capital
in
economics
a
government
may
regulate
trade
as
well
as
to
rule
over
land
governments
also
control
people
and
decide
things
about
what
morality
to
accept
or
punish
in
many
countries
there
are
strict
rules
about
sexual
intercourse
and
drugs
which
are
part
of
law
and
offenders
are
punished
for
disobeying
them
tax
is
how
government
is
paid
for
in
most
countries
people
who
buy
sell
import
invest
own
a
house
or
land
or
earn
money
are
made
to
pay
some
of
the
money
to
a
government
there
are
many
theories
of
how
to
organize
government
better
these
are
called
theories
of
civics
many
people
think
leaders
must
be
elected
by
some
kind
of
democracy
that
way
they
can
be
replaced
at
election
many
governments
are
not
a
democracy
but
other
forms
in
which
only
a
few
people
have
power
there
are
many
theories
of
how
to
run
a
government
better
and
keep
people
from
hurting

prisons
are
usually
surrounded
by
walls
and
gates
there
are
usually
many
locked
gates
inside
the
prison
to
control
the
inmates
the
inmates
sleep
in
small
locked
rooms
called
cells
cells
have
a
bunk
bed
a
toilet
and
a
sink
inmates
are
allowed
to
leave
their
cell
every
day
for
exercise
some
inmates
work
in
the
prison
during
the
day
either
in
a
factory
or
doing
cooking
or
cleaning
law
enforcement
officers
called
prison
guards

the
manager
of
a

is
called
the
warden

uk
australia
prisons
usually
also
include
other
buildings
and
facilities
such
as
a
chapel
a
library
an
exercise
yard
a
gymnasium
an
infirmary
small
hospital
visiting
rooms
for
visits
from
family
and
lawyers
kitchens
and
accommodation
for
prison
staff
the
level
of
security
a
prison
has
depends
on
the
type
of
prison
a
maximum
security
prison
has
even
more
protection
than
a
regular
prison
some
prisons
in
the
united
states
have
a
section
called
death
row
where
people
who
have
been
sentenced
to
death
are
kept
in
prison
until
their
execution
on
the
other
hand
an
open
prison
is
a
prison
where
inmates
can
often
travel
out
of
the
prison
these
are
used
for
prisoners
who
have
been
convicted
of
minor
crimes
or
who
will
soon
be
released
the
united
nations
made
the
standard
minimum
rule
for
human
treatment
for
prisoners
in
also
the
article
of
international
covenant
on
civil
and
political
rights
also
affirm
the
treatment
with
humanity
for
them
in
prison
in
some
prisons
people
imprisoned
for
child
sexual
abuse
are
separated
from
other
prisoners
for
their
own
safety
there
are
four
main
ideas
about
what
prisons
should
be
used
for:
rehabilitation:
prisons
should
be
places
that
turn
the
prisoners
into
good
people
deterrence:
people
should
be
scared
by
the
thought
of
going
to
prison
so
they
will
not
want
to
commit
crimes
incapacitation:
locking
criminals
up
stops
them
from
committing
more
crimes
retribution:
by
forcing
them
to
spend
time
in
prison
society
is
taking
revenge
against
people
who
break
the
law
a
person
who
has
been
charged
with
a
crime
but
has
not
yet
been
convicted
for
it
in
a
court
may
be
sent
to
prison
if:
the
court
thinks
that
the
person
may
not
come
to
their
trial
the
court
thinks
that
the
person
may
be
a
danger
to
the
community
or
mainly
in
the
us
the
court
has
asked
for
bail
money
but
the
person
cannot
pay
the
amount
in
some
parts
of
the
us
a
person
who
is
arrested
may
be
held
at
a
county
jail
until
they
decide
whether
to
charge
or
release
the
person
in
other
places
a
person
who
is
arrested
will
be
held
at
a
police
station
not
a
prison
male
and
female
inmates
are
usually
kept
in
separate
locations
and
often
in
separate
prisons
there
are
special
prisons
for
people
under
the
age
of
who
commit
crimes
these
inmates
are
called
young
offenders
or
juvenile
offenders
these
places
will
not
always
have
the
word
prison
in
their
name
instead
having
names
like
young
offenders'
institution
prisons
are
a
controversial
topic
that
people
have
different
views
about
people
who
think
that
we
should
have
prisons
say
that
removing
people
who
commit
crimes
from
society
prevents
them
from
committing
more
crimes
and
punishes
them
for
their
behavior
they
also
say
that
putting
people
in
prison
may
also
prevent
others
who
are
likely
to
commit
similar
crimes
from
committing
them
people
who
think
that
we
should
not
put
people
in
prisons
say
that
being
put
in
prison
makes
people
more
violent
and
angry
people
who
commit
minor
crimes
that
are
sent
to
prison
meet
violent
criminals
as
well
when
people
are
sent
to
prison
they
cannot
see
their
family
or
children
which
can
cause
problems
for
their
family
sometimes
people
are
put
in
prison
who
have
done
nothing
wrong
an
american
theory
that
is
critical
of
prisons
is
called
the
prison
industrial
complex
people
who
believe
in
the
prison
industrial
complex
think
that
private
prison
companies
want
lots
of
people
to
be
put
in
prison
in
order
to
make
money
as
of
there
are
currently
nine
million
people

sections
this
medical
specialty
consists
of
well
trained
doctors
who
recognize
and
treat
medical
conditions
associated
with
the
eyes
health
a
disease
can
be
caused
by
many
things
sometimes
germs
enter
our
body
through
food
water
or
air
a
person
can
be
infected
by
infectious
agents
like
bacteria
viruses
or
fungus
disease
can
also
be
caused
by
eating
bad
or
old
foods
there
are
small
germs
in
old
foods
that
can
cause
diseases
sometimes
the
germs
produce
chemicals
or
toxins
which
causes
the
disease
one
of
the
most
common
causes
of
disease
is
poor
sanitation
and
lack
of
clean
water
some
deadly
diseases
like
malaria
in
tropical
parts
of
the
world
are
spread
by
a
mosquito
animals
that
spread
disease
are
called
vectors
there
are
many
vectors
including
snails
ticks
and
fleas
some
people
are
born
with
'genetic
diseases'
these
are
diseases
because
of
an
error
or
mutation
in
a
person's
dna
an
example
of
a
mutation
is
cancer
living
or
working
in
an
unhealthy
environment
can
also
be
a
cause
for
diseases
diseases
are
more
common
in
older
people
some
diseases
can
be
helped
with
medicine
infections
can
often
be
cured
by
antibiotics
though
resistance
to
antibiotics
is
a
problem
some
disease
may
be
helped
by
surgery
not
every
disease
can
be
helped
with
medicine
or
surgery
though
some
diseases
must
be
treated
during
the
whole
life
they
are
chronic
long-lasting
diseases
an
example
of
a
chronic
disease
is
diabetes
mellitus
diabetes
can
be
treated
made
better
but
it
can
not
yet
be
cured
made
to
totally
go
away
people
who
usually
treat
diseases
are
called
doctors
or
physicians
some
diseases
that
are
common
or
very
bad
are
tested
for
even
in
people
who
are
healthy
if
these
diseases
are
found
early
they
can
be
treated
before
they
cause
problems
an
example
would
be
checking
a
woman
for
cervical
cancer
with
a
test
called
a
pap
smear
if
cervical
cancer
is
found
early
it
can
be
cured
if
it
is
found
later
it
usually
causes
death
another
example
is
immunization
the
basic
of
it
is
to
make
the
body
ready
for
a
disease
the
body
has
its
own
defense
against
disease
called
the
immune
system
one
special
characteristic
of
the
immune
system
is
its
ability
to
remember
if
a
person
had
been
sick
before
and
had
recovered
the
immune
system
produce
a
substance
called
antibodies
which
fight
the
disease
if
it
comes
back
to
the
person
the
antibody
is
specific
to
a
particular
disease
or
antigen
an
example
of
this
is
measles
which
is
a
virus
a
person
usually
a
child
who
had
never
been
sick
with
measles
is
given
a
milder
form
of
the
virus
this
cause
the
immune
system
to
produce
antibodies
against
the
virus
if
this
person
is
exposed
to
the
same
virus
in
the
future
the
person's
immune
system
will
remember
and
will
fight
the
virus
for
general
prevention
to
be
useful:
the
disease
must
be
found
and
stopped
in
early
stage
the
disease
should
be
common
or
be
easy
to
recognize
the
test
for
the
disease
should
be
easy
work
all
the
time
and
not
hurt
people
the
society
is
well-trained
and
can
recognize
most
common
symptoms
on
some
diseases
the
treatment
for
the
disease
should
be
safe
and
be
easy
for
people
to
get
epidemiology
is
the
study
of
the
cause
of
disease
some
diseases
are
more
popular
for
people
with
common
characteristics
like
similar
origins
sociological
background
food
or
nationality
without
good
epidemiological
research
some
diseases
can
be
hard
to
track
and
to
name
some
diseases
can
be
taken
for
something
else
this
is
why
epidemiology
takes
a
huge
part
in
understanding
how
to
protect
ourselves
against
viruses
toxins
and
bacteria

there
is
no
easy
way
to
be
sure
when
clothing
was
first
developed
because
it
was
prehistoric
and
clothing
is
perishable
some
information
comes
from
studying
lice
the
body
louse
lives
in
clothing
and
diverged
from
head
lice
about
years
ago
this
suggests
that
clothing
existed
at
that
time
another
theory
is
that
modern
humans
are
the
only
survivors
of
several
species
of
primates
who
may
have
worn
clothes
and
that
clothing
may
have
been
used
as
long
ago
as
thousand
years
ago
other
louse-based
estimates
put
the
introduction
of
clothing
at
around
–
bc
a
cloak
made
of
the
fur
of
squirrels
from
a
cave
in
italy
has
been
dated
to
years
bp
and
is
possibly
among
the
oldest
items
of
clothing
people
often
decorate
their
bodies
with
makeup
or
perfume
and
they
also
cut
or
change
the
hair
on
their
heads
and
faces
they
might
also
go
in
for
body
modification:
tattoos
scarifications
and
body
piercings
but
makeup
and
tattoos
are
not
kinds
of
clothing
things
that
are
carried
and
not
worn
like
wallets
purses
canes
and
umbrellas
are
called
accessories
but
they
are
not
kinds
of
clothing
either
jewelry
and
eyeglasses
are
also
accessories
that
are
put
on
the
body
nail
polish
is
also
put
on
the
fingertips
and
can
be
interpreted
as
makeup
clothing
is
often
made
of:
cloth
natural
fibres
such
as
cotton
flax
wool
hemp
ramie
silk
synthetic

the
earliest
records
on

are
from
chinese
documents
one
of
those
records
said
there
were
many
small
countries
in
japan
which
had
wars
between
them
and
later
a
country
ruled
by
a
queen
became
the
strongest
unified
others
and
brought
peace
the
japanese
began
to
write
their
own
history
after
the
th
and
th
centuries
when
people
from
korea
and
china
taught
japan
about
the
chinese
writing
system
japan's
neighbours
also
taught
them
buddhism
the
japanese
changed
buddhism
in
many
ways
for
example
japanese
buddhists
used
ideas
such
as
zen
more
than
other
buddhists
in
the
ancient
and
middle
ages
china
gave
japan
many
new
cultural
ideas
but
their
friendship
became
weaker
later
in

late
th

mongolians
from
china
tried
to

japan
twice
but
they
could
not
the
samurai

europe
japan
had
some
contact
with
the
europeans
in

the
portuguese
were
the
first
europeans
to

later
the
spanish
english
and
dutch
came
to
japan
to
trade
also
they
brought
christianity
japan's
leaders
welcomed
them
at
first
but
because
europeans
had
conquered
many
places
in
the
world
the
japanese
were
scared
they
would
conquer
japan
too
so
the
japanese
did
not
let
the
europeans
come
into

anymore
except
in
a
small
area
in

city
many
christians
were
killed
only
the
chinese
korean

dutch
people
were
allowed
to

they
were
under
careful
control
of

japan

opened
for

again
in

matthew
perry
when
the
americans
wanted

ports
for

perry
brought
steamships
with

which
scared
the
japanese
into
making
an
agreement
with
him
this

meanwhile
the
remains
of
eastern
rome
had
become
the
byzantine
empire
which
was
started
by
roman
emperor
constantine
in
and
likewise
had
a
capital
city
named
constantinople
the
byzantine
empire
controlled
asia
minor
and
northern
africa
and
sometimes
southern
spain
and
southern
italy
but
its
lands
were
slowly
eaten
away
by
enemies
like
the
turks
and
the
franks
as
a
walled
city
on
a
peninsula
the
city
of
constantinople
was
difficult
to
attack
the
ottoman
turks
eventually
seized
constantinople
in
they
called
the
city
by
its
present-day
name
istanbul
the
fall
of
constantinople
is
sometimes
called
the
end
of
the
middle
age
islam
was
founded
in
the
early
th
century
by
the
islamic
prophet
muhammad
muslims
believe
that
the
qur'an
is
god's
ultimate
revelation
to
mankind
islam
spread
quickly
through
warfare
and
along
the
major
trade
routes
of
the
old
world
finding
appeal
with
traders
and
travellers
the
islamic
religion
soon
split
between
the
sunni
muslims
and
the
shi'a
the
sunni
religion
is
the
majority
roughly
of
muslims
belong
to
this
sect
most
shi'a
live
in
modern-day
iran
and
iraq
the
sunni-shi'a
split
has
been
compared
to
the
catholic-eastern
orthodox
split
of
the
christian
church
much
later
in
muslims
quickly
conquered
the
christian
countries
of
iraq
syria
egypt
north
africa
and
spain
the
christians
were
able
to
keep
france
and
other
european
countries
later
muslims
took
other
countries
such
as
persia
and
india
where
they
built
the
mughal
empire
the
muslim
ottoman
empire
eventually
conquered
parts
of
eastern
europe
the
muslims
took
hold
of
vast
areas
of
land
making
them
a
superpower
of
the
middle
ages
during
the
early
middle
ages
muslims
achieved
what
is
remembered
as
a
golden
age
of
knowledge
during
these
times
of
strife
in
europe
muslim
caliphs
gathered
the
ancient
texts
of
the
great
empires
rome
greece
egypt
and
attempted
to
re-integrate
that
knowledge
during
this
time
a
persian
muslim
helped
develop
progress
in
algebra
the
golden
age
of
islam
ended
with
the
ottoman
invasions
in
the
th
century
during
the
middle
ages
trade
between
countries
became
much
more
common
it
was
mostly
through
the
middle
eastern
/
asian
trade
route
known
as
the
silk
road
arabs
served
as
the
middle
men
in
international
trade
trade
in
this
time
was
based
on
how
valuable
the
item
was
the
items
that
had
higher
value
and
low
weight
travelled
the
farthest
gold
silk
etc
and
items
that
were
heavier
and
worth
less
would
travel
mostly
short
distances
food
for
example
would
mostly
travel
only
within
a
few
villages
during
the
high
middle
ages
wealth
began
to
return
and
consumers
began
to
demand
luxuries
again
silk
porcelain
spices
incense
gold
and
gems
all
travelled
thousands
of
miles
across
deserts
mountains
and
plains
glass
was
in
turn
imported
from
europe
to
east
trade
was
greatly
interrupted
several
times
during
the
crusades
-
due
to
the
aggression
between
muslims
and
europeans
and
because
of
mongolian
invasions
and
later
because
of
the
black
plague
it
is
thought
that
the
mongols
brought
the
plague
with
them
from
asia
and
devastated
the
world
population
from
-
almost
a
third
of
the
world's
population
was
killed
by
the
plague
at
this
time
although
the
americas
were
not
touched
by
the
disease
at
all
buddhism
is
a
non-theistic
religion
in
other
words
buddhists
don't
believe
in
a
god
that
is
based
on
philosophy
it
began
in
india
but
is
almost
entirely
gone
from
that
area
now
muslim
invaders
of
the
mughal
dynasty
drove
out
this
system
of
beliefs
more
or
less
forcing
buddhism
to
flee
east
where
it
eventually
took
strong
roots
in
china
during
the
middle
ages
the
mongols
created
the
world's
largest
empire
controlling
much
of
asia
the
middle
east
and
far
eastern
europe
mongolia
was
so
large
and
powerful
that
its
strength
imposed
what
was
later
called
the
pax
mongolica
similar
to
the
roman
pax
romana
pax
is
latin
for
peace
with
no
war
inside
the
mongol
empire
international
trade
and
diplomacy
along
the
silk
road
greatly
expanded
mongol
leader
genghis
khan
built
an
empire
that
was
so
large
it
collapsed
under
its
own
size
much
like
alexander
the
great's
did
around
the
time
of
the
khan's
death
in
the
former
mongol
empire
was
split
four
ways
leaving
the
chinese
to
become
the
dominant
power
in
the
far
east
once
again
later
the
chinese
took
control
of
northern
china
again
under
the
yuan
dynasty
around
a
chinese
admiral
named
zheng
he
went
to
explore
the
world
his
fleet
of
'treasure
ships'
explored
great
areas
of
the
eastern
world
and
were
many
times
larger
than
anything
the
europeans
had
built
a
zheng
he
treasure
ship
was
wider
than
columbus'
ship
'santa
maria'
was
long
unfortunately
for
zheng
his
voyages
were
ended
before
he
had
a
chance
to
discover
the
americas
the
late
middle
ages
were
the
last
two
centuries
of
the
middle
ages
from
around
when
the
crusades
ended
to
columbus
voyage
to
the
new
world
during
this
period
the
gun
changed
war
and
aristocracy
and
feudalism
became
less
important
states
founded
standing

before
armies
were
only
formed
when
there
was
a

states
only
made
their

money
and
identity
the

in
the
entire

developed
cities
were

grew
larger
and
richer
france
and
england
fought
the
hundred
years'
war
the
grand
duchy
of
moscow
regained
its
independence
from
the
mongols
just
like
the
chinese
and
under
the
name
russia
became
the
most
important
state
in
eastern
europe
in
the
th
century
the
ottoman
turks
conquered
the
byzantine
empire
that
event
cut
off
the
silk
road
and
the
europeans
had
to
find
new
trade
routes
in
turn
the
muslims
were
driven
off
spain
this
event
triggered
the
age
of
discovery
during
the
renaissance
in
the
late
middle
ages
the
frisians
rebelled
against
the
habsburgians
from
until
they
were
lead
into
battle
by
the
legendary
warriors

donia
and
jelckama
they
were
eventually
defeated

decapitated
beheaded

there
are
many
types
of
animals
the
common
animals
most
people
know
are
only
about
of
the
animal
kingdom
when
biologists
look
at
animals
they
find
things
that
certain
animals
have
in
common
they
use
this
to
group
the
animals
in
a
biological
classification
they
think
several
million
species
exist
but
they
have
only
identified
about
one
million
animals
can
mainly
be
divided
into
two
main
groups:
the
invertebrates
and
the
vertebrates
vertebrates
have
a
backbone
or
spine
invertebrates
do
not
vertebrates
are:
fish
or
'fishes':
both
ways
are
correct
amphibians
reptiles
birds
mammalssome
invertebrates
are:
insects
spiders
crustaceans
molluscs
like
a
snail
or
squid
worms
jellyfishin
scientific
usage
humans
are
considered
animals
in
everyday
nonscientific
usage
humans
are
often
not
considered
to
be
animals
the
animal
mode
of
nutrition
is
called
heterotrophic
because
they
get
their
food
from
other
living
organisms
some
animals
eat
only
plants
they
are
called
herbivores
other
animals
eat
only
meat
and
are
called
carnivores
animals
that
eat
both
plants
and
meat
are
called
omnivores
the
environments
animals
live
in
vary
greatly
by
the
process
of
evolution
animals
adapt
to
the
habitats
they
live
in
a
fish
is
adapted
to
its
life
in
water
and
a
spider
is
adapted
to
a
life
catching
and
eating
insects
a
mammal
living
on
the
savannahs
of
east
africa
lives
quite
a
different
life
from
a
sea
mammal
like
a
dolphin
or
porpoise
catching
fish
in
the
sea
the
fossil
record
of
animals
goes
back
about
million
years
to
the
ediacaran
period
or
somewhat
earlier
during
the
whole
of
this
long
time
animals
have
been
constantly
evolving
so
that
the
animals
alive
on
earth
today
are
very
different
from
those
on
the
edges
of
the
sea-floor
in
the
ediacaran

of
ancient

in
fiction
there
are
always
characters
there
is
usually
a
protagonist
or
hero
sometimes
this
is
a
group
of
people
not
one
person
you
usually
support
the

the

has
to

some
kind

usually
another

the

is

plot
is
a
literary
term
it
is
the
events
that
make
up
a
story
particularly
as
they
relate
to
one
another
the
events
may
form
a
pattern
that
pattern
may
be
a
sequence
through
cause
and
effect
or
how
the
reader
views
the
story
or
simply
by
coincidence
in
his
poetics
aristotle
considered
plot
mythos
the
most
important
element
of
drama—more
important
than
character
for
example
a
plot
must
have
aristotle
says
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
and
the
events
of
the
plot
must
causally
relate
to
one
another
as
being
either
necessary
or
probable
of
the
utmost
importance
to
aristotle
is
the
plot's
ability
to
arouse
emotion
in
the
psyche
of
the
audience
in
tragedy
the
emotions
are
fear
and
pity
emotions
which
he
considers
in
his
rhetoric
gustav
freytag
considered
plot
a
narrative
structure
that
divided
a
story
into
five
parts
like
the
five
acts
of
a
play
these
parts
are:
exposition
of
the
situation
rising
action
through
conflict
climax
or
turning
point
falling
action
and
resolution
the
climax
is
the
most
dangerous
and
exciting
part
of
the
plot
for
example
if
you
were
on
a
rollercoaster
the
highest
part
would
be
the
climax
the
climax
usually
near
to
the
end
of
the
story
because
the
whole
story
has
been
building
up
to
it
rising
action
in
an
action
drama
it
is
the
point
when
the
hero
or
heroine
looks
like
s/he
is
about
to
lose
and
is
in
the
greatest
danger
conflict
is
very
important
in
fiction
every
work
of
fiction
needs
a
conflict
or
problem
there
are
five
basic
types
of
conflict
in
modern
times
a
new
one
person
vs
technology
has
been
used
person
vs
self
is
when
a
character
is
facing
his
own
fears
confusion
or
philosophy
sometimes
the
character
tries
to
find
out
who
he
or
she
is
and
comes
to
realize
it
or
change
it
sometimes
the
character
struggles
to
find
out
what
is
right
or
wrong
although
the
enemy
is
inside
the
character
they
can
be
influenced
by
outside
forces
the
struggle
of
the
human
being
to
come
to
a
decision
is
the
base
of
this
type
of
conflict
person
vs
person
is
when
the
hero
is
fighting
another
person
there
is
usually
more
than
one
time
that
the
hero
meets
the
enemy
for
example
if
a
child
is
being
bullied
that
is
person
vs
person
conflict
an
example
is
the
conflict
between
judah
and
messala
in
ben-hur
person
vs
society
is
when
the
hero's
main
source
of
conflict
is
traditions
or
ideas
the
protagonist
is
basically
fighting
what
is
wrong
with
the
world
he
lives
in
society
itself
is
often
treated
as
a
single
character
just
as
another
person
is
in
person
vs
person
conflict
an
example
in
literature
would
be
wuthering
heights
by
emily
brontë
person
vs
nature
is
when
a
character
is
fighting
against
forces
of
nature
many
films
focus
on
this
theme
it
is
also
found
in
stories
about
trying
to
survive
in
places
far
away
from
humans
like
jack
london's
short
story
to
build
a
fire
person
vs
supernatural
is
when
a
character
is
battling
supernatural
forces
sometimes
this
force
is
inside
themselves
it
is
internal
such
stories
are
sometimes
used
to
represent
or
criticize
freud's
theory
of
id
vs
superego
bram
stoker's
dracula
is
a
good
example
of
this
as
well
as
frankenstein
by
mary
shelley
and
christabel
by
samuel
coleridge
it
is
also
very
common
in
comic
books
person
vs
machine/technology
places
a
character
against
robot
forces
with
artificial
intelligence
i
robot
and
the
terminator
series
are
good
examples
of
this
conflict

the
prime
purpose
of
a
library
is
to
provide
access
to
knowledge
and
information
to
fulfil
this
mission
libraries
preserve
a
valuable
record
of
culture
then
they
pass
down
this
to
the
coming
generations
therefore
they
are
an
essential
link
between
the
past
present
and
future
people
utilise
library
resources
in
their
work
they
also
use
library
resources
to
gain
information
about
personal
interests
sometimes
they
obtain
recreational
materials
such
as
films
and
novels
students
use
libraries
to
enhance
their
classroom
experiences
libraries
help
the
students
to
develop
good
reading
and
study
habits
public
officials
use
libraries
for
research
and
public
issues
the
libraries
provide
information
and
services
that
are
essential
for
learning
and
progress
this
habit
of
reading
can
be
developed
only
if
we
get
into
the
habit
of
going
to
a
library
regularly
and
spending
a
lot
of
time
there
that
is
the
place
that
provides
just
the
right
atmosphere
necessary
for
studies
and
assimilating
and
retaining
all
the
knowledge
taken
it
the
environment
in
a
library
is
ideal
for
the
intellectual
growth
of
individuals
this
is
the
place
where
one
can
get
unlimited
stocks
of
books
on
any
and
every
subject
that
may
be
of
interest
or
need
for
an
individual
a
library
is
the
place
where
one
can
spend
hours
of
time
fruitfully
and
filled
with
interest
one
can
learn
so
much
by
reading
books
authored
by
eminent
writers
and
thus
become
knowledgeable
many
places
have
a
public
library
where
anybody
can
join
if
they
live
in
the
area
with
a
library
card
people
can
borrow
books
and
take
them
home
for
several
weeks
it
does
not
cost
money
to
get
a
library
card
at
most
public
libraries
books
are
kept
on
shelves
in
a
special
order
so
they
are
easy
to
find
public
libraries
have
stories
and
books
about
lots
of
things
many
public
libraries
have
books
and
cds
about
learning
english
stories
are
kept
in
alphabetical
order
by
the
last
name
of
the
person
who
wrote
them
the
author
books
about
other
things
are
often
given
a
special
number
that
refers
to
what
they
are
about
they
are
then
put
on
the
shelf
in
number
order
one
number
system
used
by
many
libraries
is
the
dewey
decimal
system
many
colleges
and
universities
have
large
academic
libraries
these
libraries
are
for
the
use
of
college
students
professors
and
researchers
academic
libraries
are
used
mainly
for
doing
research
like
studying
the
solar
system
or
how
earthquakes
happen
these
libraries
do
not
have
the
same
types
of
books
you
would
find
in
a
public
library
they
usually
do
not
have
fiction
books
or
books
for
children
unless
they
are
being
studied
academic
libraries
can
have
many
books
sometimes
more
than
a
million
special
libraries
are
those
libraries
that
are
not
public
libraries
or
academic
libraries
they
are
usually
small
many
times
a
special
library
holds
books
on
a
particular
subject
or
even
a
special
kind
of
book
some
special
libraries
keep
just
old
books
or
books
by
shakespeare
a
special
library
can
be
owned
by
a
business
for
use
only
by
that
business
for
example
disney
world
in
orlando
has
its
own
library
that
is
not
open
to
the
public

for
the
use
of
the
people
who
work
for
the

the
earliest
known
library
was
discovered
in
iraq
and
belonged
to
the
ancient
civilization
in
sumer
they
didn't
use
paper
books
but
instead
wrote
everything
on
clay
tablets
using
a
style
of
writing
called
cuneiform
these
tablets
are
over
years
old
the
library
of
alexandria
in
egypt
was
the
largest
and
most
important
library
of
the
ancient
world
it
was
destroyed
when
the
romans
conquered
egypt
in
bc
rome’s
first
public
library
was
established
by
asinius
pollio
who
was
a
lieutenant
of
julius
caesar
eventually
rome
would
build
public
libraries
within
the
city
when
the
roman
empire
fell
in
ad
many
books
went
east
to
the
city
of
byzantium
where
a
large
library
was
built
other
libraries
were
built
in
monasteries
and
public
homes
libraries
began
to
appear
in
many
islamic
cities
where
science
and
philosophy
survived
after
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
surprisingly
christian
monks
and
islamic
libraries
exchanged
books
to
copy
these
books
eventually
made
there
way
ludwig
wittgenstein
was
probably
the
first
academic
philosopher
to
address
the
definition
of
the
word
game
in
his
philosophical
investigations
wittgenstein
demonstrated
that
the
elements
parts
of
games
such
as
play
rules
and
competition
all
fail
to
correctly
define
what
games
are
he
concluded
that
people
apply
the
term
game
to
a
range
of
different
human
activities
that
are
only
related
a
little
bit
french
sociologist
roger
caillois
in
his
book
les
jeux
et
les
hommes
games
and
men
said
that
a
game
is
an
activity
which
is
these
things:
fun:
the
activity
is
fun
to
do
separate:
the
activity
cannot
happen
everywhere
or
all
the
time
uncertain:
the
people
doing
the
activity
do
not
know
how
it
will
end
non-productive:
doing
the
activity
does
not
make
or
do
anything
useful
governed
by
rules:
the
activity
has
rules
that
are
different
from
everyday
life
fictitious:
the
people
doing
the
activity
know
that
the
game
is
not
reality
computer
game
designer
chris
crawford
tried
to
define
the
word
game
using
a
series
of
comparisons:
something
creative
is
art
if
it
was
made
because
it
is
beautiful
and
entertainment
if
it
was
made
for
money
this
is
the
least
rigid
of
his
definitions
crawford
acknowledges
that
he
often
chooses
a
creative
path
over
conventional
business
wisdom
which
is
why
only
one
of
his
games
is
a
sequel
something
that
is
entertainment
is
a
plaything
if
it
is
interactive
movies
and
books
are
entertainment
but
not
interactive
if
a
plaything
does
not
have
any
goals
to
complete
it
is
a
toy
crawford
notes
that
by
his
definition
a
a
toy
can
become
a
game
element
if
the
player
makes
up
rules
and
b
the
sims
and
simcity
are
toys
not
games
if
a
plaything
has
goals
it
is
a
challenge
if
a
challenge
does
not
have
an
enemy
it
is
a
puzzle
if
it
has
an
enemy
or
enemies
it
is
a
conflict
crawford
admits
that
this
is
a
subjective
test
video
games
with
noticeably
algorithmic
artificial
intelligence
can
be
played
as
puzzles
these
include
the
patterns
used
to
evade
ghosts
in
pac-man
if
the
player
can
only
do
better
at
something
than
an
enemy
and
cannot
hurt
the
enemy
or
slow
him
down
the
conflict
is
a
competition
racing
and
figure
skating
are
competitions
however
if
attacks
are
allowed
then
the
conflict
qualifies
as
a
game
crawford's
definition
of
a
game
is:
an
interactive
goal-oriented
activity
with
enemies
to
play
against
and
where
players
and
enemies
can
interfere
with
each
other
homo

playing
man
is
a
book
written
in
by
dutch
historian
johan
huizinga
it
discusses
the
importance
of
the
play
element
in
culture
and
society
huizinga
suggests
that
play
is
a
condition
for
the
generation
of
culture
the
first
writer
of
history
was
herodotus
an
ancient
greek
he
wrote
a
book
called
“the
histories”
around
bc
which
is
nearly
years
ago
some
of
the
stories
he
wrote
were
not
true
and
we
don't
know
if
this
is
one
of
those
herodotus
tells
us
about
king
atys
he
ruled
about
[five
thousand
five
hundred]
years
ago
in
a
country
called
lydia
his
country
was
in
western
asia
minor
near
modern
greece
atys
had
a
serious
problem
his
lands
had
very
little
food
because
the
climate
was
not
good
for
agriculture
the
people
of
lydia
demonstrated
patience
and
hoped
that
the
good
times
of
plenty
would
return
but
when
things
failed
to
get
better
the
people
of
lydia
thought
up
a
strange
solution
for
their
problem
the
path
they
took
to
fight
their
natural
need
to
eat
–
the
hungry
times
caused
by
the
unusually
hard
climate
-
was
to
play
games
for
one
entire
day
so
that
they
would
not
think
about
food
on
the
next
day
they
would
eat
so
eating
occurred
every
second
day
in
this
way
they
passed
years
and
in
that
time
they
invented
dice
balls
and
all
the
games
commonly
played
today
games
appear
in
all
cultures
all
over
the
world
an
ancient
custom
that
brings
people
together
for
social
opportunities
games
allow
people
to
go
beyond
the
limit
of
the
immediate
physical
experience
to
use
their
imagination
common
features
of
games
include
a
finish
that
you
cannot
forecast
agreed
upon
rules
competition
separate
place
and
time
imaginary
elements
elements
of
chance
established
goals
and
personal
enjoyment
games
are
used
to
teach
to
build
friendships
and
to
indicate
status
in
his
history
book
the
dutch
writer
johan
huizinga
says
that
games
are
older
than
human
culture
he
sees
games
as
the
beginning
of
complex
human
activities
such
as
language
law
war
philosophy
and
art
ancient
people
used
bones
to
make
the
first
games
dice
are
very
early
game
pieces
games
began
as
part
of
ancient
religions
the
oldest
gaming
pieces
ever
found
–
[forty
nine]
small
painted
stones
with
pictures
cut
into
them
from
[five
thousand]
years
ago
–
come
from
turkey
so
perhaps
the
history
of
herodotus
is
true
one
of
the
first
board
games
senet
appears
in
ancient
egypt
around
[three
thousand
five
hundred]
years
ago
the
ancient
greeks
had
a
board
game
similar
to
checkers
and
also
many
ball
games
the
first
reference
to
the
game
of
go
occurs
in
chinese
records
from
around
[two
thousand
four
hundred]
years
ago
originally
the
game
go
was
used
by
political
leaders
to
develop
skill
in
strategy
and
mental
skill
knowing
how
to
play
go
was
required
by
a
chinese
gentleman
along
with
the
skills
of
artistic
writing
or
calligraphy
painting
and
the
ability
to
play
a
musical
instrument
these
were
regarded
as
the
four
most
important
skills
in
ancient
china
a
gentleman
had
to
pass
a
test
in
these
four
key
skills
in
order
to
get
a
good
paying
job
in
the
government
the
chinese
brought
go
to
korea
and
it
entered
japan
around
[one
thousand
five
hundred]
years
ago
and
it
has
been
popular
ever
since
in
march
of
a
google
computer
program
beat
the
best

players
in
the
world
go
is
believed
to
be
the
most
complex
board
game
ever
created
is
this
computer
program
smarter
than
a

well
it
did
beat
the

master
lee
se-dol
and
lee
was
surprised
by
the
result
he
acknowledged
defeat
after
three
and
a
half
hours
of

demis
hassabis
who
made
the
google
program
called
it
an
important
moment
in
history
because
a
machine
beat
the
best
person
in
the
world
in
an
intelligent
game
such
computer
programs
rely
on
what
is
called
artificial

go
is
a
two-player
game
of
strategy
said
to
have
had
an
origin
in
china
perhaps
around
[three
thousand]
years
ago

compete
to

black
and
white

the
first
computer
game
that
was
ever
created
was
probably
the
game
oxo
by
alexander
douglas
in
it
was
a
version
of
tic-tac-toe

most
people
consider
the
first
true
computer
game
where
players
actually
participate
to
be
tennis
for

developed
in
by
the
physics
scientist
william
higginbotham
he
wanted
to
teach
about
gravity
the
force
of
attraction
between
masses
these
men
who
created
the
early
computer
games
did
not
forecast
the
potential
for
the
popular
use
of
games
because
at
that
period
in
modern
history
it
took
a
small
room
full
of
computers
to
make
these
games
work
another
early

in
by

university
student
steve
russell
in

which
was

commercial
success
being
a
commercial
success
means
that
it
made
a
lot
of
money
this
was
the
true
beginning
of
computer
games
that
could
be
played
at
home
today
all
around
the
world
people
spend
more
the
[three
billion]
hours
a
week
playing
computer

this
is
equivalent
to
more
than

his
employer
did
not
like
his
idea
even
if
his
idea
was
never
realized
he
is
the
first
man
to
have
thought
of
the
idea
of
video
games
later
creating
the
first

the
official
creation
of
the
university
was
in
when
king
henry
iii
of
england
gave
to
the
people
there
the
right
to
teach
students
and
lower
taxes
a
letter
from
pope
gregory
ix
in
also
gave
the
right
to
everyone
who
got
a
degree
from
cambridge
to
teach
in
any
place
in
the
christian
world
in
pope
nicholas
iv
called
cambridge
a
studium
generale
name
for
a
university
in
medieval
times
from
that
point
many
researchers
and
teachers
from
other
european
universities
started
to
come
to
cambridge
to
work
or
give
lessons
colleges
started
as
places
for
students
and
teachers
to
live
they
were
called
hostels
at
first
the
students
paid
money
to
build
and
run
these
hostels
all
colleges
were
formed
after
the
beginning
of
the
university
over
the
years
colleges
bought
all
of
these
hostels
back
however
some
old
names
still
resist
today
such
as
garret
hostel
lane
which
was
named
after
garret
hostel
peterhouse
was
the
first
official
college
to
be
created
in
many
followed
over
the
centuries
and
today
there
are
the
last
one
robinson
was
built
in
the
many
of
these
have
a
chapel
because
the
members
should
have
prayed
for
the
soul
of
the
founders
the
people
who
created
the
college
the
university
was
one
of
the
most
important
places
where
the
protestant
reformation
began
in
fact
people
started
talking
about
lutheranism
here
very
early
thomas
cranmer
who
became
a
central
figure
for
reform
studied
at
cambridge
a
century
later
some
people
in
cambridge
started
to
think
that
the
church
of
england
was
too
much
like
the
catholic
church
they
started
the
puritan
movement
this
produced
more
than
people
who
left
for
new
england
around
in
search
for
a
place
with
better
religious
beliefs
oliver
cromwell
a
very
important
member
of
this
movement
was
a
student
at
sidney
sussex
during
this
time
cambridge
has
been
strong
in
applied
mathematics
since
isaac
newton
was
a
student
here
in
the
th
century
every
student
had
to
study
maths
in
order
to
obtain
a
degree
the
degree
was
awarded
as
a
bachelor
of
arts
which
mixed
both
arts
and
science
subjects
several
important
early
physicists
studied
at
cambridge
they
include
james
clerk
maxwell
lord
kelvin
and
lord
rayleigh
pure
mathematics
was
slower
to
catch
up
but
cambridge
is
still
famous
for
it
thanks
to
people
like
g
h
hardy
six
maths
graduates
from
cambridge
won
a
fields
medal
and
one
who
got
an
abel
prize
these
are
the
world's
highest
awards
for
mathematicians
four
other
researchers
at
cambridge
also
won
fields
medals
people

for
many
years
only
men
were
allowed
to
study
at
cambridge
in
girton
the
first
college
for
women
was
built
women
could
take
exams
from
but
only
in
did
they
start
to
be
considered
full
members
of
the
university
for
a
certain
time
they
even
received
ad
eundem
degrees
degrees
from
a
university
you
have
not
studied
at
but
you
deserve
from
the
university
of
dublin
over
the
years
more
women-only
colleges
were
built
until
in
churchill
was
the
first
one
to
become
mixed
many
others
followed
and
in
magdalene
was
the
last
men-only
college
to
open
to
women
however
there
are
still
some
colleges
for
women
only
cambridge
is
the
only
university
that
still
has
this
characteristic
all
other
universities
in
the
uk
including
oxford
now
have
only
mixed
colleges
since
it
is
very
old
the
university
has
many
legends
and
traditions
these
are
often
passed
on
by
older
students
to
the
younger
ones
tour
guides
also
tell
these
stories
to
tourists
the
wooden
spoon
tradition
was
to
give
this
type
of
spoon
to
the
student
who
was
the
worst
in
the
year
for
mathematics
but
still
passed
the
exams
this
was
because
the
students
used
to
be
ranked
in
order
of
their
result
after
this
was
changed
and
so
the
wooden
spoon
cannot
be
given
anymore
however
still
today
in
many
sport
competitions
a
wooden
spoon
is
given
to
the
last
person
in
the
rankings
many
legends
exist
about
places
in
cambridge
for
example
there
is
a
story
about
the
mathematical
bridge
in
queen's
college
newton
built
it
without
using
any
bolts
or
screws
some
people
then
took
it
down
to
see
how
it
was
made
when
they
tried
to
put
it
up
again
they
could
not
do
it
so
they
had
to
insert
many
bolts
another
tradition
is
that
the
king's
college
choir
sings
the
nine
lessons
and
carols
church
service
this
is
recorded
by
the
bbc
and
sent
around
the
world
since
by
radio
from
it
can
also
be
seen
on
television
many
people
watch
it
on
christmas
eve
in
great
britain
the
university
of
cambridge
is
a
collegiate
university
this
means
it
is
divided
into
the
colleges
and
every
student
and
teacher
joins
one
college
only
every
one
of
these
colleges
has
its
own
property
and
money
they
all
have
many
fellows
who
can
teach
all
the
subjects
between
them
then
there
are
departments
and
faculties
which
are
buildings
where
only
one
subject
is
studied
there
are
also
schools
that
bring
different
departments
and
faculties
together
the
overall
head
of
the
university
is
called
the
vice-chancellor

decisions
for
the
whole
university

cambridge:
there
are

smaller
affiliated
colleges:
westcott
house

not
real
colleges
but
students
there
can
follow
the
university
of
cambridge's
lessons
they
are
only
for
theology
the
study
of
religion
these
three
colleges
together
form
the
cambridge
theological
federation
the
teaching
is
done
through
lectures
and
practical
classes
where
students
do
experiments
in
science
subjects
organized
by
the
department
the
colleges
also
organize
supervisions
these
are
small
lessons
in
groups
of
or
:
the
students
do
some
homework
and
then
talk
about
it
with
a
teacher
this
is
often
considered
to
be
one
of
the
best
things
about
studying
at
cambridge
the
teaching
is
very
personal
and
students
have
the
chance
to
ask
lots
of
questions
and
really
understand
the
subject
there
are
more
than
different
faculties
and
departments
in
cambridge
these
are
then
grouped
into

a
supervisory
body

group
of
people

a
university
rule
which

that
students
can
get
their
degree
only
if
they
have
stayed
for
at
least
terms
years
at
a
distance

church
in
cambridge
the
head
of
the
university
is
the

he
is
david
sainsbury
he
was
elected
in
after
prince
philip
duke
of
edinburgh
said
he
did
not
want
to
do
it
anymore
prince
philip
had
been
chancellor
for
years
the
position
of
chancellor
is
mainly
ceremonial
that
means
that
the
chancellor
does
not
take
part
in
many
decisions
he
is
just
there
because
an
overall
head
of
the
university
is
needed
the
vice-chancellor
instead
is
the
one
that
makes
most
decisions
for
example
he/she
approves
and
signs
new
rules
the
role
is
given
to
a
person
for
at
least
five
years
the
current
vice-chancellor
is
stephen
j
toope
the
senate
house
is
a
building
in
cambridge
the
degree
ceremony
takes
place
there
any
cambridge
student
who
has
an
ma
degree
is
a
member
of
the
senate
it
is
also
the
place
where
the
important
people
in
the
university
meet
to
take
decisions
these
important
people
are
different
officers
and
fellows
of
the
colleges
they
are
also
called
the
regent
house
this
is
not
another
building
it
is
just
a
way
of
calling
these
people
they
can
make
and
change
rules
when
they
meet
news
and
information
are
printed
and
given
out
in
the
cambridge
university
reporter
this
is
the
official
newspaper
of
the
university
the
university
had
£
billion
in
endowments
in
this
money
was
given
over
lots
of
time
by
many
people
this
is
the
biggest
amount
of
money
for
universities
in
europe
every
college
controls
its
money
on
its
own
they
are
all
considered
charitable
organizations
the
british
government
also
gives
money
in
research
grants:
these
are
for
postgraduate
students
and
their
teachers
there
is
also
some
income
produced
by
the
cambridge
university
press
in
cambridge
received
a
very
large
donation
of
us
million
from
the
bill
melinda
gates
foundation
this
was
to
set
up
a
scholarship
so
that
us
and
other
international
students
could
study
in
cambridge
more
easily
bill
gates
was
also
made
a
knight
by
the
queen
because
of
his
generosity
between
and
a
campaign
was
made
to
get
£
billion
from
old
students
this
was
at
the
same
time
of
the
university's
th
anniversary
the
campaign
got
to
the
target
early
in
the
university
is
spread
around
the
town
of
cambridge
the
older
colleges
are
on
the
river
cam
the
departments
and
faculties
are
spread
in
different
places
usually
grouped
in
sites
there
are
nine
main
sites:
addenbrooke's
hospital
is
where
the
medicine
students
go
to
learn
how
to
cure
patients
the
judge
business
school
is
another
important
building:
this
is
where
courses
about
business
and
finance
are
taught
since
the
different
sites
are
quite
close
to
each
other
many
students
like
to
use
the
bicycle
to
move
around
a
fifth
of
the
journeys
in
the
town
is
made
by
bike
students
are
also
not
allowed
to
drive
a
car
while
they
are
in
cambridge
local
people
from
cambridge
don't
always
like
the
students
town
and
gown
is
a
phrase
to
talk
about
this
relationship
town
means
the
cambridge
locals
while
gown
means
the
students
and
teachers
from
the
type
of
dress
they
wear
since
the
university
began
there
have
been
some
fights
between
the
two
groups
in
many
things
were
stolen
from
the
university
and
the
colleges
the
chancellor
was
then
given
extra
power
to
control
order
in
the
town
when
the
plague
arrived
in
cambridge
in
many
colleges
closed
up
they
did
not
want
to
help
the
locals
who
had
the
disease
however
more
recently
there
have
been
fewer
fights
the
university
also
means
more
jobs
and
money
for
the
population
there
are
many
small
industries
that
were
created
in
cambridge
because
the
university
was
near
this
effect
is
called
the
cambridge
phenomenon
between
-
there
have
been
new
companies
and
new
jobs
in
cambridge
just
thanks
to
the
university
the
university
has
libraries
the
main
one
is
called
cambridge
university
library
it
is
a
legal
deposit
which
means
every
book
that
is
printed
in
the
united
kingdom
goes
in
this
library
many
departments
have
their
own
library
as
well
they
usually
have
special
books
for
their
subjects
only
all
colleges
have
a
library
this
is
mainly
for
the
undergraduates
so
that
they
can
read
basic
books
about
their
subjects
some
colleges
also
have
very
precious
books
and
manuscripts
for
example
the
parker
library
corpus
christi
college
has
special
books
from
medieval
times
the
university
also
has
museums
and
a
botanical
garden:

that
has
a
museum
for
the

cambridge
university
botanic
garden
that
was
created
in
one
of
the
main
aims
of
the
university
of
cambridge
is
to
do
scientific
research
all
the
departments
are
always
studying
and
discovering
new
things
many
important
people
have
done
research
in
cambridge
this
is
because
the
university
has
a
lot
of
money
and
resources
like
laboratories
and
books
it
had
£
m
in
to
spend
on
research
this
was
mainly
given
by
the
uk
government
and
the
european
commission
students
need
to
pass
some
tests
and
interviews
to
be
allowed
in
cambridge
for
undergraduates
the
application
is
done
through
ucas
this
is
as
with
any
other
university
in
the
uk
students
need
to
be
very
good
to
enter
cambridge
if
they
study
a-levels
they
are
asked
to
get
at
least
aaa
because
many
good
students
apply
the
interview
is
very
important
to
choose
the
best
ones
these
are
done
by
fellows
usually
about
of
the
applicants
get
a
place
however
the
number
changes
depending
on
the
subjects
some
of
them
like
medicine
and
economics
are
very
hard
to
get
into
students
need
to
choose
a
college
before
doing
the
application
they
may
later
have
to
change
it
if
the
college
thinks
they
are
good
but
does
not
have
enough
places
for
them
for
postgraduates
the
application
is
different
they
need
to
ask
professors
teachers
in
the
departments
they
want
to
work
in
after
an
interview
they
can
be
given
a
place
they
then
have
to
get
some
funding
money
to
do
the
project
this
can
be
given
from
a
government
or
another
institution
some
people
think
that
admission
at
cambridge
is
not
very
fair
this
is
because
it
is
easier
to
get
in
if
you
go
to
a
private
school
instead
of
a
state
school
in
-
only
of
students
who
got
a
place
were
coming
from
state
school
however
about
of
british
children
go
to
them
if
a
student
goes
to
a
private
school
he/she
is
also
more
likely
to
get
a
place
after
the
interview
in
only
of
students
that
applied
from
state
school
got
a
place
while
the
percentage
was
for
private
school
students
the
university
is
trying
to
make
things
better
by
making
the
admission
process
easier
and
giving
scholarships
for
the
poorer
students
another
problem
is
that
year
after
year
there
are
also
fewer
people
from
state
schools
applying
cambridge
does
very
well
when
the
quality
of
research
is
tested
in
it
was
ranked
first
in
the
british
government
assessment
exercise
cambridge
also
gives
out
more
phds
in
a
year

usually

very
well
in
it
the

many
public

can
be
for
people

take
language
tests
in
english
for
example
some
of
the
a-level
and
gcses
exams
are
also
written
and
organized
