general the details of aristotle's life are not well-established||the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.aristotle whose name means the best purpose in ancient greek was born in bc in stagira chalcidice about km miles east of modern-day thessaloniki||his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon||both of aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian||although little information about aristotle's childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy.at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato's academy||he remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving athens in / bc||the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy's direction after control passed to plato's nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the anti-macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died||aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor||after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon||while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermias's adoptive daughter or niece||she bore him a daughter whom they also named pythias||in bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander||aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon||during aristotle's time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings: ptolemy and cassander||aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotle's own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric||in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants||by bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum||aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years||while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him a son whom he named after his father nicomachus||according to the suda he also had an erômenos palaephatus of abydus.this period in athens between and bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works||he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived||those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students||his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics on the soul and poetics||aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre.near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander's relationship with persia and persians||a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexander's death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death||following alexander's death anti-macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled||in bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated: i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy – a reference to athens's trial and execution of socrates||he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.||with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until th-century advances in mathematical logic||kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion.||what we today call aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism methods of logical argument aristotle himself would have labelled analytics||the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics||most of aristotle's work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers||the logical works of aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the organon around bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers||the books are: categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutationsthe order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle's writings||it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations||the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu: the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning||the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics.||like his teacher plato aristotle's philosophy aims at the universal||aristotle's ontology places the universal katholou in particulars kath' hekaston things in the world whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate||this means that aristotle's epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these||for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in a particular substance||aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies on deduction from a priori principles.in aristotle's terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences||aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry||aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science||note however that his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method||for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics b||his practical science includes ethics and politics his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics.||the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics||aristotle called it first philosophy and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science physics as the contemplative theoretikē philosophy which is theological and studies the divine||he wrote in his metaphysics a: if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge but if there is some motionless independent thing the knowledge of this precedes it and is first philosophy and it is universal in just this way because it is first||and it belongs to this sort of philosophy to study being as being both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being.||aristotle examines the concepts of substance ousia and essence to ti ên einai the what it was to be in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form a philosophical theory called hylomorphism||in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed||for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc||or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house||the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption b–a he distinguishes the coming to be from: growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality||the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property||in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form||referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else||for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei plant and if is not prevented by something it will become a plant||some definitions are: merriam-webster dictionary defines statistics as a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection analysis interpretation and presentation of masses of numerical data||statistician arthur lyon bowley defines statistics as numerical statements of facts in any department of inquiry placed in relation to each other.statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection analysis interpretation or explanation and presentation of data or as a branch of mathematics||some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics||while many scientific investigations make use of data statistics is concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty.||mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics||mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis linear algebra stochastic analysis differential equations and measure-theoretic probability theory.||in applying statistics to a problem it is common practice to start with a population or process to be studied||populations can be diverse topics such as all persons living in a country or every atom composing a crystal||ideally statisticians compile data about the entire population an operation called census||this may be organized by governmental statistical institutes||descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the population data||numerical descriptors include mean and standard deviation for continuous data types like income while frequency and percentage are more useful in terms of describing categorical data like race||when a census is not feasible a chosen subset of the population called a sample is studied||once a sample that is representative of the population is determined data is collected for the sample members in an observational or experimental setting||again descriptive statistics can be used to summarize the sample data||however the drawing of the sample has been subject to an element of randomness hence the established numerical descriptors from the sample are also due to uncertainty||to still draw meaningful conclusions about the entire population inferential statistics is needed||it uses patterns in the sample data to draw inferences about the population represented accounting for randomness||these inferences may take the form of: answering yes/no questions about the data hypothesis testing estimating numerical characteristics of the data estimation describing associations within the data correlation and modeling relationships within the data for example using regression analysis||inference can extend to forecasting prediction and estimation of unobserved values either in or associated with the population being studied it can include extrapolation and interpolation of time series or spatial data and can also include data mining.||when full census data cannot be collected statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples||statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models||the idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid-s in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life insurance.to use a sample as a guide to an entire population it is important that it truly represents the overall population||representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole||a major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative||statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures||there are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population||sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory||probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and more generally the properties of statistical procedures||the use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method||the difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is roughly that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples||statistical inference however moves in the opposite direction—inductively inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.||a common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables||there are two major types of causal statistical studies: experimental studies and observational studies||in both types of studies the effect of differences of an independent variable or variables on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed||the difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted||each can be very effective||an experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study manipulating the system and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements||in contrast an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation||instead data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated||while the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies they are also applied to other kinds of data—like natural experiments and observational studies—for which a statistician would use a modified more structured estimation method e.g||difference in differences estimation and instrumental variables among many others that produce consistent estimators.||the basic steps of a statistical experiment are: planning the research including finding the number of replicates of the study using the following information: preliminary estimates regarding the size of treatment effects alternative hypotheses and the estimated experimental variability||consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary||statisticians recommend that experiments compare at least one new treatment with a standard treatment or control to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects||design of experiments using blocking to reduce the influence of confounding variables and randomized assignment of treatments to subjects to allow unbiased estimates of treatment effects and experimental error||at this stage the experimenters and statisticians write the experimental protocol that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the primary analysis of the experimental data||performing the experiment following the experimental protocol and analyzing the data following the experimental protocol||further examining the data set in secondary analyses to suggest new hypotheses for future study||documenting and presenting the results of the study.experiments on human behavior have special concerns||the famous hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the hawthorne plant of the western electric company||the researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers||the researchers first measured the productivity in the plant then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity||it turned out that productivity indeed improved under the experimental conditions||however the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness||the hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome in this case worker productivity changed due to observation itself||those in the hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.||an example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer||this type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis||in this case the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers perhaps through a cohort study and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group||a case-control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest e.g||lung cancer are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.||various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement||the psychophysicist stanley smith stevens defined nominal ordinal interval and ratio scales||nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values and permit any one-to-one transformation||ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values but have a meaningful order to those values and permit any order-preserving transformation||interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined but the zero value is arbitrary as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in celsius or fahrenheit and permit any linear transformation||ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined and permit any rescaling transformation||because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables which can be either discrete or continuous due to their numerical nature||such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the boolean data type polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating point computation||but the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented||other categorizations have been proposed||for example mosteller and tukey distinguished grades ranks counted fractions counts amounts and balances||nelder described continuous counts continuous ratios count ratios and categorical modes of data||see also chrisman van den berg .the issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions||the relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations||whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer hand p||.||consider independent identically distributed iid random variables with a given probability distribution: standard statistical inference and estimation theory defines a random sample as the random vector given by the column vector of these iid variables||the population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters||a statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample but not a function of unknown parameters||the probability distribution of the statistic though may have unknown parameters||consider now a function of the unknown parameter: an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function||commonly used estimators include sample mean unbiased sample variance and sample covariance||a random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown parameter is called a pivotal quantity or pivot||widely used pivots include the z-score the chi square statistic and student's t-value||between two estimators of a given parameter the one with lower mean squared error is said to be more efficient||furthermore an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter||other desirable properties for estimators include: umvue estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency and consistent estimators which converges in probability to the true value of such parameter||this still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation several methods have been proposed: the method of moments the maximum likelihood method the least squares method and the more recent method of estimating equations.||interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis which is usually but not necessarily that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time.the best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial||the word chemistry comes from alchemy which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry metallurgy philosophy astrology astronomy mysticism and medicine||it is often seen as linked to the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold though in ancient times the study encompassed many of the questions of modern chemistry being defined as the study of the composition of waters movement growth embodying disembodying drawing the spirits from bodies and bonding the spirits within bodies by the early th century greek-egyptian alchemist zosimos||an alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech and later the suffix -ry was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as chemistry||the modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the arabic word al-kīmīā الكیمیاء||in origin the term is borrowed from the greek χημία or χημεία||this may have egyptian origins since al-kīmīā is derived from the greek χημία which is in turn derived from the word kemet which is the ancient name of egypt in the egyptian language||alternately al-kīmīā may derive from χημεία meaning cast together.||the current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model||traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles atoms molecules substances metals crystals and other aggregates of matter||this matter can be studied in solid liquid or gas states in isolation or in combination||the interactions reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together||such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory||the chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware||however glassware is not central to chemistry and a great deal of experimental as well as applied/industrial chemistry is done without it||a chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances||the basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms||it can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation which usually involves atoms as subjects||the number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal||when the number of atoms on either side is unequal the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay||the type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules known as chemical laws||energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies||chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure phase as well as their chemical compositions||they can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis e.g||spectroscopy and chromatography||scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists||most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines||several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry some of them are:||in chemistry matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume it takes up space and is made up of particles||the particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest mass such as the photon||matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances.||the atom is the basic unit of chemistry||it consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud||the nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons together called nucleons while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus||in a neutral atom the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons||the nucleus is dense the mass of a nucleon is appromixately times that of an electron yet the radius of an atom is about times that of its nucleus.the atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element such as electronegativity ionization potential preferred oxidation states coordination number and preferred types of bonds to form e.g||metallic ionic covalent.||a chemical element is a pure substance which is composed of a single type of atom characterized by its particular number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms known as the atomic number and represented by the symbol z||the mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus||although all the nuclei of all atoms belonging to one element will have the same atomic number they may not necessarily have the same mass number atoms of an element which have different mass numbers are known as isotopes||for example all atoms with protons in their nuclei are atoms of the chemical element carbon but atoms of carbon may have mass numbers of or .the standard presentation of the chemical elements is in the periodic table which orders elements by atomic number||the periodic table is arranged in groups or columns and periods or rows||the periodic table is useful in identifying periodic trends.||a compound is a pure chemical substance composed of more than one element||the properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements||the standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac||organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system||the names for inorganic compounds are created according to the inorganic nomenclature system||when a compound has more than one component then they are divided into two classes the electropositive and the electronegative components||in addition the chemical abstracts service has devised a method to index chemical substances||in this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its cas registry number.||a molecule is the smallest indivisible portion of a pure chemical substance that has its unique set of chemical properties that is its potential to undergo a certain set of chemical reactions with other substances||however this definition only works well for substances that are composed of molecules which is not true of many substances see below||molecules are typically a set of atoms bound together by covalent bonds such that the structure is electrically neutral and all valence electrons are paired with other electrons either in bonds or in lone pairs||thus molecules exist as electrically neutral units unlike ions||when this rule is broken giving the molecule a charge the result is sometimes named a molecular ion or a polyatomic ion||however the discrete and separate nature of the molecular concept usually requires that molecular ions be present only in well-separated form such as a directed beam in a vacuum in a mass spectrometer||charged polyatomic collections residing in solids for example common sulfate or nitrate ions are generally not considered molecules in chemistry||some molecules contain one or more unpaired electrons creating radicals||most radicals are comparatively reactive but some such as nitric oxide no can be stable||the inert or noble gas elements helium neon argon krypton xenon and radon are composed of lone atoms as their smallest discrete unit but the other isolated chemical elements consist of either molecules or networks of atoms bonded to each other in some way||identifiable molecules compose familiar substances such as water air and many organic compounds like alcohol sugar gasoline and the various pharmaceuticals||however not all substances or chemical compounds consist of discrete molecules and indeed most of the solid substances that make up the solid crust mantle and core of the earth are chemical compounds without molecules||these other types of substances such as ionic compounds and network solids are organized in such a way as to lack the existence of identifiable molecules per se||instead these substances are discussed in terms of formula units or unit cells as the smallest repeating structure within the substance||examples of such substances are mineral salts such as table salt solids like carbon and diamond metals and familiar silica and silicate minerals such as quartz and granite||one of the main characteristics of a molecule is its geometry often called its structure||while the structure of diatomic triatomic or tetra atomic molecules may be trivial linear angular pyramidal etc||the structure of polyatomic molecules that are constituted of more than six atoms of several elements can be crucial for its chemical nature.||a chemical substance is a kind of matter with a definite composition and set of properties||a collection of substances is called a mixture||examples of mixtures are air and alloys.||the mole is a unit of measurement that denotes an amount of substance also called chemical amount||the mole is defined as the number of atoms found in exactly ||kilogram or grams of carbon- where the carbon- atoms are unbound at rest and in their ground state||the number of entities per mole is known as the avogadro constant and is determined empirically to be approximately .× mol−||molar concentration is the amount of a particular substance per volume of solution and is commonly reported in mol/dm.||in addition to the specific chemical properties that distinguish different chemical classifications chemicals can exist in several phases||for the most part the chemical classifications are independent of these bulk phase classifications however some more exotic phases are incompatible with certain chemical properties||a phase is a set of states of a chemical system that have similar bulk structural properties over a range of conditions such as pressure or temperature||physical properties such as density and refractive index tend to fall within values characteristic of the phase||the phase of matter is defined by the phase transition which is when energy put into or taken out of the system goes into rearranging the structure of the system instead of changing the bulk conditions||sometimes the distinction between phases can be continuous instead of having a discrete boundary in this case the matter is considered to be in a supercritical state||when three states meet based on the conditions it is known as a triple point and since this is invariant it is a convenient way to define a set of conditions||the most familiar examples of phases are solids liquids and gases||many substances exhibit multiple solid phases||for example there are three phases of solid iron alpha gamma and delta that vary based on temperature and pressure||a principal difference between solid phases is the crystal structure or arrangement of the atoms||another phase commonly encountered in the study of chemistry is the aqueous phase which is the state of substances dissolved in aqueous solution that is in water||less familiar phases include plasmas bose–einstein condensates and fermionic condensates and the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases of magnetic materials||while most familiar phases deal with three-dimensional systems it is also possible to define analogs in two-dimensional systems which has received attention for its relevance to systems in biology.||atoms sticking together in molecules or crystals are said to be bonded with one another||a chemical bond may be visualized as the multipole balance between the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges oscillating about them||more than simple attraction and repulsion the energies and distributions characterize the availability of an electron to bond to another atom||a chemical bond can be a covalent bond an ionic bond a hydrogen bond or just because of van der waals force||according to the online etymology dictionary the word monkey may originate in a german version of the reynard the fox fable published circa ||the rules of chess are published by fide fédération internationale des échecs chess's international governing body in its handbook||rules published by national governing bodies or by unaffiliated chess organizations commercial publishers etc||may differ||fide's rules were most recently revised in .||chess is played on a square board of eight rows called ranks and denoted with numbers to and eight columns called files and denoted with letters a to h||the colors of the squares alternate and are referred to as light and dark squares||the chessboard is placed with a light square at the right-hand end of the rank nearest to each player||by convention the game pieces are divided into white and black sets and the players are referred to as white and black respectively||each player begins the game with pieces of the specified color which consist of one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns||the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo with each queen on a square of its own color the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark.||the player with the white pieces always moves first||after the first move players alternately move one piece per turn except for castling when two pieces are moved||pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece which is captured and removed from play||with the sole exception of en passant all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies||a player may not make any move that would put or leave the player's own king under attack||a player cannot pass at each turn one must make a legal move this is the basis for the finesse called zugzwang||if the player to move has no legal move the game is over it is either a checkmate a loss for the player with no legal moves if the king is under attack or a stalemate a draw if the king is not||each chess piece has its own way of moving||in the diagrams the dots mark the squares where the piece can move if there are no intervening pieces of either color||the king moves one square in any direction||the king also has a special move called castling that involves also moving a rook||the rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file but cannot leap over other pieces||along with the king a rook is involved during the king's castling move||the bishop can move any number of squares diagonally but cannot leap over other pieces||the queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank file or diagonal but cannot leap over other pieces||the knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank file or diagonal thus the move forms an l-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally or two squares horizontally and one square vertically||the knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces||the pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied black dots in the diagram or the pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file by moving to that square black xs||a pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion.||once in every game each king is allowed to make a special move known as castling||castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook which is on the player's first rank and then placing the rook on the last square that the king has just crossed||castling is permissible under the following conditions: neither the king nor the rook have previously moved during the game||there cannot be any pieces between the king and the rook||the king cannot be in check nor can the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces or move to a square where it would result in a check||note that castling is permissible if the rook is attacked or if the rook crosses a square that is attacked.||when a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and there is an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant in passing and move to the square the pawn passed over||this can only be done on the very next move otherwise the right to do so is forfeit||for example in the animated diagram the black pawn advances two squares from g to g and the white pawn on f can take it via en passant on g but only on white's next move.||when a pawn advances to the eighth rank as a part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen rook bishop or knight of the same color||usually the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen but in some cases another piece is chosen this is called underpromotion||in the animated diagram the pawn on c can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted to an allowed piece||there is no restriction placed on the piece that is chosen on promotion so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game for example two queens.||when a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces it is said to be in check||a response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack that is not in check||this can involve capturing the checking piece interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen rook or bishop and there is a square between it and the king or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack||castling is not a permissible response to a check||the object of the game is to checkmate the opponent this occurs when the opponent's king is in check and there is no legal way to remove it from attack||it is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check||in casual games it is common to announce check when putting the opponent's king in check but this is not required by the rules of the game and is not usually done in tournaments.||games can be won in the following ways: checkmate: the player whose turn it is to move is in check and has no legal move to escape check||resignation: either player may resign conceding the game to the opponent||it is usually considered poor etiquette to play on in a truly hopeless position and for this reason high-level games rarely end in checkmate||win on time: in games with a time control a player wins if the opponent runs out of time even if the opponent has a much superior position as long as the player still has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent||forfeit: a player who cheats or violates the rules of the game or violates the rules specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited||in high-level tournaments players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game even by a matter of seconds receiving a call or text on a cell phone refusing to undergo a drug test refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices and unsporting behavior such as refusing to shake the opponent's hand.||there are several ways games can end in a draw: draw by agreement: draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players||the correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw make a move then start the opponent's clock||traditionally players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game occasionally even without playing a move in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty||stalemate: the player whose turn it is to move has no legal move and is not in check||threefold repetition of position: this most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage||in this situation either player can claim a draw this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged||the three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid||fide rules make no mention of perpetual check this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition||fifty-move rule: if during the previous moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made either player can claim a draw||there are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than moves before a pawn move or capture is made examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops||historically fide has sometimes revised the -move rule to make exceptions for these endgames but these have since been repealed||some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fifty-move rule||fivefold repetition of position: similar to the threefold-repetition rule but in this case neither player needs to claim the draw thus a tournament director can intervene and declare the game to be drawn||this is a relatively recent addition to the fide rules||seventy-five-move rule: similar to the fifty-move rule however if the final move in the sequence resulted in checkmate this takes precedence||as with the fivefold-repetition rule this applies independently of claims by the players and allows a tournament director to intervene||this rule likewise is a recent addition to the fide rules||insufficient material: if neither player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent for example if a player has only the king and a knight left and the opponent has only the king left checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule||on the other hand if both players have a king and a knight left there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate so this rule does not apply||draw on time: in games with a time control the game is drawn if a player is out of time and the opponent has no theoretical possibility to checkmate the player.||chess games may also be played with a time control||if a player's time runs out before the game is completed the game is automatically lost provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate||the duration of a game ranges from long or classical games which can take up to seven hours even longer if adjournments are permitted to bullet chess under minutes per player for the entire game||intermediate between these are rapid chess games lasting between minutes and two hours per game a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments||time is controlled using a chess clock that has two displays one for each player's remaining time||analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks which allow for time controls with increments.||chess is believed to have originated in eastern india c||– in the gupta empire where its early form in the th century was known as chaturaṅga sanskrit: चतुरङ्ग literally four divisions [of the military] – infantry cavalry

player and was held in london in ||it was won by the german adolf anderssen who was hailed as the leading chess master||his brilliant energetic attacking style was typical for the time||sparkling games like anderssen's immortal game and evergreen game or morphy's opera game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art.deeper insight into the nature of chess came with two younger players||american paul morphy an extraordinary chess prodigy won against all important competitors except staunton who refused to play including anderssen during his short chess career between and ||morphy's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks.||prague-born wilhelm steinitz beginning in described how to avoid weaknesses in one's own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent's position||the scientific approach and positional understanding of steinitz revolutionized the game||steinitz was the first to break a position down into its components||before steinitz players brought their queen out early did not completely develop their other pieces and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king which either succeeded or failed||the level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan||in addition to his theoretical achievements steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading german master johannes zukertort in is regarded as the first official world chess championship||steinitz lost his crown in to a much younger player the german mathematician emanuel lasker who maintained this title for years the longest tenure of all world champions||after the end of the th century the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew||some sources state that in the title of chess grandmaster was first formally conferred by tsar nicholas ii of russia to lasker capablanca alekhine tarrasch and marshall but this is a disputed claim||the tradition of awarding such titles was continued by the world chess federation fide founded in in paris||in the women's world chess championship was established the first to

title to dutch player max euwe in and regained it two years later.between the world wars chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called hypermodernists like aron nimzowitsch and richard réti||they advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawns which become objects of attack.||after the death of alekhine a new world champion was sought||fide which has controlled the title since then except for one interruption ran a tournament of elite players||the winner of the tournament russian mikhail botvinnik started an era of soviet dominance in the chess world||until the end of the soviet union there was only one non-soviet champion american bobby fischer champion

previous informal system of world championships the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match||fide set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches||the world's strongest players were seeded into interzonal tournaments where they were joined by players who had qualified from zonal tournaments||the leading finishers in these interzonals would go on the candidates stage which was initially a tournament and later a series of knockout matches||the winner of the candidates would then play the

soviet anatoly karpov when fide did not meet his demands and karpov obtained the title by default||fischer modernized many aspects of chess especially by extensively preparing openings.karpov defended his title twice against viktor korchnoi and dominated the and early with a string of tournament successes||karpov's reign finally ended in at the hands of garry kasparov another soviet player from baku azerbaijan||kasparov and karpov contested five world title matches between and karpov never won his title back||in garry kasparov and nigel short broke with fide to organize their own match for the title and formed a competing professional chess association pca||from then until there were two simultaneous world champions and world championships: the pca or classical champion extending the steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of many games and the other following fide's new format of many players competing in a tournament to determine the champion||kasparov lost his classical title in to vladimir kramnik of russia||the world chess championship in which kramnik beat the fide world champion veselin topalov reunified the titles and made

match of and ||in magnus carlsen beat anand in the world chess championship||he defended his title the following year again against anand and is the reigning world champion.||chess games and positions are recorded using a system of notation most commonly algebraic chess notation||abbreviated or short algebraic notation generally records moves in the format abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved||the pieces are identified by their initials||in english these are k king q queen r rook b bishop and n knight n is used to avoid confusion with king||for example qg means queen moves to the g-file and the th rank that is to the square g||chess literature published in other languages may use different initials to indicate the pieces or figurine algebraic notation fan may be used to avoid language difficulties||to resolve ambiguities one more letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved e.g||ngf means knight from the g-file moves to the square f and re means rook on the first rank moves to e||the letter p for a pawn is not used so that e means pawn moves to the square e||if the piece makes a capture x is inserted before the destination square||thus bxf means bishop captures on f||when a pawn makes a capture the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial and ranks may be omitted if unambiguous||for example exd pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d or exd pawn on the e-file captures a piece somewhere on the d-file||particularly in germany some publications have used : rather than x to indicate a capture but this is now rare||some publications omit the capture symbol altogether so that exd would be rendered simply as ed||if a pawn moves to its last rank achieving promotion the piece chosen is indicated after the move for example eq or e=q||castling is indicated by the special notations - for kingside castling and -- for queenside castling||an en passant capture is sometimes marked with the notation e.p||a move that places the opponent's king in check usually has the notation added||the notation for a double check is considered obsolete||checkmate can be indicated by ||at the end of the game – means white won – means black won and ½–½ indicates a draw.chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols||for example indicates a good move an excellent move ? a mistake ?? a blunder ? an interesting move that may not be best or ? a dubious move not easily refuted||for example one variation of a simple trap known as the scholar's mate see animated diagram can be recorded: ||e e ||qh? nc ||bc nf?? ||qxf –the text-based portable game notation pgn which is understood by chess software is based on short form english language algebraic notation||until about the majority of english language chess publications used a form of descriptive notation||in descriptive notation files are named according to the piece which occupies the back rank at the start of the game and each square has two different names depending on whether it is from white's or black's point of view||for example the square known as e in algebraic notation is k king's rd from white's point of view and k king's th from black's point of view||when recording captures the captured piece is named rather than the square on which it is captured except to resolve ambiguities||thus scholar's mate is rendered in descriptive notation: ||p-k p-k ||q-r? n-qb ||b-b n-b?? ||qxbp –a few players still prefer descriptive notation but it is no longer recognized by fide||another system is iccf numeric notation recognized by the international correspondence chess federation though its use is in decline||squares are identified by numeric coordinates for example a is and h is ||moves are described by the from and to squares and captures are not indicated||for example the opening move .e is rendered as .||castling is described by the king's move only for example for white castling kingside for black castling queenside.||chess strategy consists of setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game – for example where to place different pieces – while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver||these two parts of the chess-playing process cannot be completely separated because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play||a game of chess is normally divided into three phases: opening typically the first moves when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle then middlegame and last the endgame when most of the pieces are gone kings typically take a more active part in the struggle and pawn promotion is often decisive.||in chess tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions – so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or by a computer||the possible depth of calculation depends on the player's ability||in quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical while in tactical positions with a limited number of forced variations strong players can calculate long sequences of moves||simple one-move or two-move tactical actions – threats exchanges of material and double attacks – can be combined into more complicated combinations sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players||theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers for example pins forks skewers batteries discovered attacks especially discovered checks zwischenzugs deflections decoys sacrifices underminings overloadings and interferences.a forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a combination||brilliant combinations – such as those in the immortal game – are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers||a common type of chess exercise aimed at developing players' skills is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it.||chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for the future play||during the evaluation players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board control of the center and centralization the pawn structure king safety and the control of key squares or groups of squares for example diagonals open files and dark or light squares||the most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides||the point values used for this purpose are based on experience usually pawns are considered worth one point knights and bishops about three points each rooks about five points the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange and queens about nine points||the king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined since its checkmate loses the game||but in practical terms in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook||these basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece e.g||advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares coordination between pieces e.g||a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight or the type of position e.g||knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions||another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure sometimes known as the pawn skeleton or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard||since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position||weaknesses in the pawn structure such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and holes once created are often permanent||care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset for example by the possibility of developing an attack.||a chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game the opening moves||recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the ruy lopez or sicilian defense||they are catalogued in reference works such as the encyclopaedia of chess openings||there are dozens of different openings varying widely in character from quiet positional play for example the réti opening to very aggressive the latvian gambit||in some opening lines the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than moves||professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers as opening theory continues to evolve||the fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar: development: this is the technique of placing the pieces particularly bishops and knights on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game||control of the center: control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent||king safety: it is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities||a correctly timed castling can often enhance this||pawn structure: players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and pawn islands – and to force such weaknesses in the opponent's position.most players and theoreticians consider that white by virtue of the first move begins the game with a small advantage||this initially gives white the initiative||black usually strives to neutralize white's advantage and achieve equality or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position.||the middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening||there is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed||similarly there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame see start of the endgame||because the opening theory has ended players have to form plans based on the features of the position and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position||python was conceived in the

it is possible that κῶμος itself is derived from κώμη and originally meant a village revel||the adjective comic greek κωμικός kōmikós which strictly means that which relates to comedy is in modern usage generally confined to the sense of laughter-provoking||of this the word came into modern usage through the latin comoedia and italian commedia and has over time passed through various shades of meaning.the greeks and romans confined their use of the word comedy to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings||aristotle defined comedy as an imitation of men worse than the average where tragedy was an imitation of men better than the average||however the characters portrayed in comedies were not worse than average in every way only insofar as they are ridiculous which is a species of the ugly||the ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others the mask for instance that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain||in the middle ages the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings||it is in this sense that dante used the term in the title of his poem la commedia||as time progressed the word came more and more to be associated with any sort of performance intended to cause laughter||during the middle ages the term comedy became synonymous with satire and later with humour in general||aristotle's poetics was translated into arabic in the medieval islamic world where it was elaborated upon by arabic writers and islamic philosophers such as abu bischr and his pupils al-farabi avicenna and averroes||they disassociated comedy from greek dramatic representation and instead identified it with arabic poetic themes and forms such as hija satirical poetry||they viewed comedy as simply the art of reprehension and made no reference to light and cheerful events or to the troubling beginnings and happy endings associated with classical greek comedy||after the latin translations of the th century the term comedy gained a more general meaning in medieval literature.in the late th century many scholars preferred to use the term laughter to refer to the whole gamut of the comic in order to avoid the use of ambiguous and problematically defined genres such as the grotesque irony and satire.||starting from bce aristophanes a comic playwright and satirical author of the ancient greek theater wrote comedies of which survive||aristophanes developed his type of comedy from the earlier satyr plays which were often highly obscene||the only surviving examples of the satyr plays are by euripides which are much later examples and not representative of the genre||in ancient greece comedy originated in bawdy and ribald songs or recitations apropos of phallic processions and fertility festivals or gatherings.around bce aristotle in his work poetics stated that comedy originated in phallic processions and the light treatment of the otherwise base and ugly||he also adds that the origins of comedy are obscure because it was not treated seriously from its inception||however comedy had its own muse: thalia||aristotle taught that comedy was generally positive for society since it brings forth happiness which for aristotle was the ideal state the final goal in any activity||for aristotle a comedy did not need to involve sexual humor||a comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character||aristotle divides comedy into three categories or subgenres: farce romantic comedy and satire||on the contrary plato taught that comedy is a destruction to the self||he believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning||in the republic he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter his condition provokes a violent reaction||plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state||also in poetics aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of literature||the other three genres are tragedy epic poetry and lyric poetry||literature in general is defined by aristotle as a mimesis or imitation of life||comedy is the third form of literature being the most divorced from a true mimesis||tragedy is the truest mimesis followed by epic poetry comedy and lyric poetry||the genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to aristotle's definition||comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims

fundamental civil rights and civil freedoms||we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness||these were followed by developments in philosophy of human rights by philosophers such as thomas paine john stuart mill and g.w.f||hegel during the th and th centuries||the term human rights probably came into use some time between paine's the rights of man and william lloyd garrison's writings in the liberator in which he stated that he was trying to enlist his readers in the great cause of human rights||although the term had been used by at least one author as early as .||in the th century human rights became a central concern over the issue of slavery||a number of reformers notably british member of parliament william wilberforce worked towards the abolition of the atlantic slave trade and abolition of slavery||this was achieved

restrict the concept of artistic works to modern western societies||one early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older latin meaning which roughly translates to skill or craft as associated with words such as artisan||english words derived from this meaning include artifact artificial artifice medical arts and military arts||however there are many other colloquial uses of the word all with some relation to its etymology||over time philosophers like plato aristotle socrates and kant among others questioned the meaning of art||several dialogues in plato tackle questions about art: socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational||he speaks approvingly of this and other forms of divine madness drunkenness eroticism and dreaming in the phaedrus a–c and yet in the republic wants to outlaw homer's great poetic art and laughter as well||in ion socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of homer that he expresses in the republic||the dialogue ion suggests that homer's iliad functioned in the ancient greek world as the bible does today in the modern christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance if only it can be properly interpreted.with regards to the literary art and the musical arts aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art each varying in imitation by medium object and manner||for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language||the forms also differ in their object of imitation||comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average||lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama||aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.the second and more recent sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early th century||fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer work of art||within this latter sense the word art may refer to several things: i a study of a creative skill ii a process of using the creative skill iii a product of the creative skill or iv the audience's experience with the creative skill||the creative arts art as discipline are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks art as objects that are compelled by a personal drive art as activity and convey a message mood or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret art as experience||art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts emotions beliefs or ideas through the senses||works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects||for some scholars such as kant the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.often if the skill is being used in a common or practical way people will consider it a craft instead of art||likewise if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art||on the other hand crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art||some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference||however even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression||the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas such as in politically spiritually or philosophically motivated art to create a sense of beauty see aesthetics to explore the nature of perception for pleasure or to generate strong emotions||the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent||the nature of art has been described by philosopher richard wollheim as one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture||art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake and as mimesis or representation||art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of aristotle||leo tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another||benedetto croce and r.g||collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator||the theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of kant and was developed in the early twentieth century by roger fry and clive bell||more recently thinkers influenced by martin heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation||george dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as the art world has conferred the status of candidate for appreciation||larry shiner has described fine art as not an essence or a fate but something we have made||art as we have generally understood it is a european invention barely two hundred years old.art may be characterized in terms of mimesis its representation of reality narrative storytelling expression communication of emotion or other qualities||during the romantic period art came to be seen as a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science.||the oldest documented forms of art are visual arts which include creation of images or objects in fields including today painting sculpture printmaking photography and other visual media||first used in english in the word parasite comes from the medieval french parasite from the latin parasitus the latinisation of the greek παράσιτος parasitos one who eats at the table of another and that from παρά para beside by σῖτος sitos wheat hence food||the related term parasitism appears in english from .||parasitism is a kind of symbiosis a close and persistent long-term biological interaction between the parasite and its host||unlike commensalism and mutualism the parasitic relationship harms the host either feeding on it or as in the case of intestinal parasites consuming some of its food||because parasites interact with other species they are well placed to act as vectors of pathogens microscopic parasites that cause disease||predation is not generally considered a symbiosis as the interaction is brief but the entomologist e||o||wilson has characterised parasites as predators that eat prey in units of less than one.within that scope are many possible ways of life||parasites are classified in a variety of different but overlapping schemes based on their interactions with their hosts and on their life cycles which are sometimes very complex||an obligate parasite is totally dependent on the host to complete its life cycle while a facultative parasite is not||parasite life cycles involving only one host are called direct those with a definitive host where the parasite reproduces sexually and at least one intermediate host are called indirect||an endoparasite is one that lives inside the host's body an ectoparasite lives outside on the host's surface||mesoparasites like some copepods enter an opening in the host's body and remain partly embedded there||it is possible for parasites to be generalists feeding on a wide range of hosts but many parasites and the majority of protozoans and helminths that parasitise animals are specialists and extremely host-specific||an early basic functional division of parasites was that of microparasites and macroparasites||these each had a mathematical model assigned in order to analyse the population movements of the host–parasite groupings||the microorganisms and viruses that can reproduce and complete their life cycle within the host are known as microparasites||macroparasites are the multicellular organisms that reproduce and complete their life cycle outside of the host or on the host's body.much of the thinking on types of parasitism has focussed on terrestrial animal parasites of animals such as helminths||those in other environments and with other hosts often have analogous strategies||for example the snubnosed eel is probably a facultative endoparasite that opportunistically burrows into and eats sick and dying fish||plant-eating insects such as scale insects aphids and caterpillars are much like ectoparasites attacking much larger plants they serve as vectors of bacteria fungi and viruses which cause plant diseases||as female scale insects are unable to move they are obligate parasites permanently attached to their hosts.||there are six major parasitic strategies namely parasitic castration directly transmitted parasitism trophically transmitted parasitism vector-transmitted parasitism parasitoidism and micropredation||these apply to parasites whose hosts are plants as well as animals||these strategies represent adaptive peaks intermediate strategies are possible but organisms in many different groups have consistently converged on these six which are evolutionarily stable||a perspective on the evolutionary options can be gained by considering four questions: the effect on the fitness of a parasite's hosts the number of hosts they have per life stage whether the host is prevented from reproducing and whether the effect depends on intensity number of parasites per host||from this analysis the major evolutionary strategies of parasitism emerge alongside predation.||parasitic castrators partly or completely destroy their host's ability to reproduce diverting the energy that would have gone into reproduction into host and parasite growth sometimes causing gigantism in the host||the host's other systems are left intact allowing it to survive and sustain the parasite||parasitic crustaceans such as those in the specialised barnacle genus sacculina specifically cause damage to the gonads of their many species of host crabs||in the case of sacculina the testes of over two-thirds of their crab hosts degenerate sufficiently for these male crabs to have gained female secondary sex characteristics such as broader abdomens smaller claws and egg-grasping appendages||various species of helminth castrate their hosts such as insects and snails||this may be directly whether mechanically by feeding on their gonads or by secreting a chemical that destroys reproductive cells or indirectly whether by secreting a hormone or by diverting nutrients||for example the trematode zoogonus lasius whose sporocysts lack mouths castrates the intertidal marine snail tritia obsoleta chemically developing in its gonad and killing its reproductive cells.||directly transmitted parasites not requiring a vector to reach their hosts include parasites of terrestrial vertebrates such as lice and mites marine parasites such as copepods and cyamid amphipods monogeneans and many species of nematodes fungi protozoans bacteria and viruses||whether endoparasites or ectoparasites each has a single host species||within that species most individuals are free or almost free of parasites while a minority carry a large number of parasites this highly uneven distribution is described as aggregated.||trophically transmitted parasites are transmitted by being eaten by a host||they include trematodes all except schistosomes cestodes acanthocephalans pentastomids many round worms and many protozoa such as toxoplasma||they have complex life cycles involving hosts of two or more species||in their juvenile stages they infect and often encyst in the intermediate host||when this animal is eaten by a predator the definitive host the parasite survives the digestion process and matures into an adult some live as intestinal parasites||many trophically transmitted parasites modify the behaviour of their intermediate hosts increasing their chances of being eaten by a predator||like directly transmitted parasites the distribution of trophically transmitted parasites among host individuals is aggregated||coinfection by multiple parasites is common||autoinfection where by exception the whole of the parasite's life cycle takes place in a single primary host can sometimes occur in helminths such as strongyloides stercoralis.||vector-transmitted parasites rely on a third party an intermediate host where the parasite does not reproduce sexually to carry them from one definitive host to another||these parasites are microorganisms namely protozoa bacteria or viruses often intracellular pathogens causing disease||their vectors are mostly hematophagic arthropods such as fleas lice ticks and mosquitoes||for example the deer tick ixodes scapularis acts as a vector for diseases including lyme disease babesiosis and anaplasmosis||protozoan endoparasites such as the malarial parasites in the genus plasmodium and sleeping sickness parasites in the genus trypanosoma infective stages in the host's blood are transported to new hosts by biting insects.||parasitoids are insects which sooner or later kill their hosts placing their relationship close to predation||most parasitoids are hymenopterans parasitoid wasps others include dipterans such as phorid flies||they can be divided into two groups idiobionts and koinobionts differing in their treatment of their hosts.idiobiont parasitoids sting their often large prey on capture either killing them outright or paralysing them immediately||the immobilised prey is then carried to a nest sometimes alongside other prey if it is not large enough to support a parasitoid throughout its development||an egg is laid on top of the prey and the nest is then sealed||the parasitoid develops rapidly through its larval and pupal stages feeding on the provisions left for it.koinobiont parasitoids which include flies as well as wasps lay their eggs inside young hosts usually larvae||these are allowed to go on growing so the host and parasitoid develop together for an extended period ending when the parasitoids emerge as adults leaving the prey dead eaten from inside||some koinobionts regulate their host's development for example preventing it from pupating or making it moult whenever the parasitoid is ready to moult||they may do this by producing hormones that mimic the host's moulting hormones ecdysteroids or by regulating the host's endocrine system.||a micropredator attacks more than one host reducing each host's fitness at least a small amount and is only in contact with any one host intermittently||this makes them suitable as vectors as they can pass smaller parasites from one host to another||most micropredators are hematophagic feeding on blood||they include annelids such as leeches crustaceans such as branchiurans and gnathiid isopods various dipterans such as mosquitoes and tsetse flies other arthropods such as fleas and ticks vertebrates such as lampreys and mammals such as vampire bats.||parasites use a variety of methods to infect animal hosts including physical contact the fecal–oral route free-living infectious stages and vectors suiting their differing hosts life cycles and ecological contexts||examples to illustrate some of the many possible combinations are given in the table.||among the many variations on parasitic strategies are hyperparasitism social parasitism brood parasitism kleptoparasitism sexual parasitism and adelphoparasitism.||hyperparasites feed on another parasite as exemplified by protozoa living in helminth parasites or facultative or obligate parasitoids whose hosts are either conventional parasites or parasitoids||levels of parasitism beyond secondary also occur especially among facultative parasitoids||in oak gall systems there can be up to five levels of parasitism.hyperparasites can control their hosts' populations and are used for this purpose in agriculture and to some extent in medicine||the controlling effects can be seen in the way that the chv virus helps to control the damage that chestnut blight cryphonectria parasitica does to american chestnut trees and in the way that bacteriophages can limit bacterial infections||it is likely though little researched that most pathogenic microparasites have hyperparasites which may prove widely useful in both agriculture and medicine.||social parasites take advantage of interspecific interactions between members of social animals such as ants termites and bumblebees||examples include the large blue butterfly phengaris arion its larvae employing ant mimicry to parasitise certain ants bombus bohemicus a bumblebee which invades the hives of other bees and takes over reproduction while their young are raised by host workers and melipona scutellaris a eusocial bee whose virgin queens escape killer workers and invade another colony without a queen||an extreme example of interspecific social parasitism is found in the ant tetramorium inquilinum an obligate parasite which lives exclusively on the backs of other tetramorium ants||emery's rule notes that social parasites tend to be closely related to their hosts often being in the same genus.intraspecific social parasitism occurs in parasitic nursing where some individual young take milk from unrelated females||in wedge-capped capuchins higher ranking females sometimes take milk from low ranking females without any reciprocation.||in brood parasitism the hosts act as parents as they raise the young as their own||brood parasites include birds in different families such as cowbirds whydahs cuckoos and black-headed ducks||these do not build nests of their own but leave their eggs in nests of other species||the eggs of some brood parasites mimic those of their hosts while some cowbird eggs have tough shells making them hard for the hosts to kill by piercing both mechanisms implying selection by the hosts against parasitic eggs||the adult female european cuckoo further mimics a predator the european sparrowhawk giving her time to lay her eggs in the host's nest unobserved.||in kleptoparasitism from greek κλέπτης kleptēs thief parasites steal food gathered by the host||the parasitism is often on close relatives whether within the same species or between species in the same genus or family||for instance the many lineages of cuckoo bees lay their eggs in the nest cells of other bees in the same family||kleptoparasitism is uncommon generally but conspicuous in birds some such as skuas are specialised in pirating food from other seabirds relentlessly chasing them down until they disgorge their catch.||a unique approach is seen in some species of anglerfish such as ceratias holboelli where the males are reduced to tiny sexual parasites wholly dependent on females of their own species for survival permanently attached below the female's body and unable to fend for themselves||the female nourishes the male and protects him from predators while the male gives nothing back except the sperm that the female needs to produce the next generation.||adelphoparasitism from greek ἀδελφός adelphós brother also known as sibling-parasitism occurs where the host species is closely related to the parasite often in the same family or genus||in the citrus blackfly parasitoid encarsia perplexa unmated females of which may lay haploid eggs in the fully developed larvae of their own species producing male offspring while the marine worm bonellia viridis has a similar reproductive strategy although the larvae are planktonic.||examples of the major variant strategies are illustrated.||a wide range of organisms is parasitic from animals plants and fungi to protozoans bacteria and viruses.||other

and january respectively and wikipedia was launched on january as a single english-language edition at www.wikipedia.com and announced by sanger on the nupedia mailing list||wikipedia's policy of neutral point-of-view was codified in its first months||otherwise there were relatively few rules initially and wikipedia operated independently of nupedia||originally bomis intended to make wikipedia

reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon whether physical or mental.an often cited article concludes that the evolving notion of document among jonathan priest otlet briet schürmeyer and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents||the shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important||levy's thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents e.g||levy ||a conventional document such as a mail message or a technical report exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits as does everything else in a digital environment||as an object of study it has been made into a document||it has become physical evidence by those who study it||document is defined in library and information science and documentation science as a fundamental abstract idea: the word denotes everything that may be represented or memorialized in order to serve as evidence||the classic example provided by suzanne briet is an antelope: an antelope running wild on the plains of africa should not be considered a document[] she rules||but if it were to be captured taken to a zoo and made an object of study it has been made into a document||it has become physical evidence being used by those who study it||indeed scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents since the antelope itself is the primary document||this opinion has been interpreted as an early expression of actor–network theory.||documents are sometimes classified as secret private or public||they may also be described as drafts or proofs||when a document is copied the source is denominated the original||standards are accepted for specific applications in various fields e.g.: academia: manuscript thesis paper and journal business: invoice quote rfp proposal contract packing slip manifest

application brief certificate commission constitutional document form gazette identity document license summons and white paper media: mock-up and scriptsuch standard documents can be drafted based on a template.||the page layout of a document is the manner in which information is graphically arranged in the space of the document e.g||on a page||the word book comes from old english bōc which in turn comes from the germanic root bōk- cognate to beech||similarly in slavic languages for example russian bulgarian macedonian буква bukva—letter is cognate with beech||in russian and in serbian and macedonian the word букварь bukvar' or буквар bukvar refers specifically to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing||it is thus conjectured that the earliest indo-european writings may have been carved on beech wood||similarly the latin word codex meaning a book in the modern sense bound and with separate leaves originally meant block of wood.||when writing systems were created in ancient civilizations a variety of objects such as stone clay tree bark metal sheets and bones were used for writing these are studied in epigraphy.||a tablet is a physically robust writing medium suitable for casual transport and writing||clay tablets were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could be easily carried and impressed with a stylus||they were used as a writing medium especially for writing in cuneiform throughout the bronze age and well into the iron age||wax tablets were pieces of wood covered in a thick enough coating of wax to record the impressions of a stylus||they were the normal writing material in schools in accounting and for taking notes||they had the advantage of being reusable: the wax could be melted and reformed into a blank||the custom of binding several wax tablets together roman pugillares is a possible precursor of modern bound codex books||the etymology of the word codex block of wood also suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.||scrolls can be made from papyrus a thick paper-like material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool until it is flattened||papyrus was used for writing in ancient egypt perhaps as early as the first dynasty although the first evidence is from the account books of king nefertiti kakai of the fifth dynasty about bc||papyrus sheets were glued together to form a scroll||tree bark such as lime and other materials were also used.according to herodotus history : the phoenicians brought writing and papyrus to greece around the th or th century bc||the greek word for papyrus as writing material biblion and book biblos come from the phoenician port town byblos through which papyrus was exported to greece||from greek we also derive the word tome greek: τόμος which originally meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote a roll of papyrus||tomus was used by the latins with exactly the same meaning as volumen see also below the explanation by isidore of seville||whether made from papyrus parchment or paper scrolls were the dominant form of book in the hellenistic roman chinese hebrew and macedonian cultures||the more modern codex book format form took over the roman world by late antiquity but the scroll format persisted much longer in asia.||isidore of seville d||explained the then-current relation between codex book and scroll in his etymologiae vi.: a codex is composed of many books a book is of one scroll||it is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks codex of trees or vines as if it were a wooden stock because it contains in itself a multitude of books as it were of branches||modern usage differs||a codex in modern usage is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as a book: leaves of uniform size bound in some manner along one edge and typically held between two covers made of some more robust material||the first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from martial in his apophoreta clxxxiv at the end of the first century where he praises its compactness||however the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan hellenistic world and only within the christian community did it gain widespread use||this change happened gradually during the rd and th centuries and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are several: the format is more economical as both sides of the writing material can be used and it is portable searchable and easy to conceal||a book is much easier to read to find a page that you want and to flip through||a scroll is more awkward to use||the christian authors may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and judaic texts written on scrolls||in addition some metal books were made that required smaller pages of metal instead of an impossibly long unbending scroll of metal||a book can also be easily stored in more compact places or side by side in a tight library or shelf space.||since musical notation only incompletely expresses a piece of music there is a whole continuum of possibilities concerning how much the performer determines the final form of the rendered work in a concert||given the wide range of styles in european classical music from medieval plainchant sung by monks to classical and romantic symphonies for orchestra from the and to avant-garde atonal compositions for solo piano from the it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type||however there are characteristics that classical music contains that few or no other genres of music contain such as the use of music notation and the performance of complex forms of solo instrumental works e.g||the fugue||furthermore while the symphony did not exist prior to the late th century the symphony ensemble—and the works written for it—have become a defining feature of classical music.||the key characteristic of european classical music that distinguishes it from popular music and folk music is that the repertoire tends to be written down in musical notation creating a musical part or score||this score typically determines details of rhythm pitch and where two or more musicians whether singers or instrumentalists are involved how the various parts are coordinated||the written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them: fugues for instance achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in counterpoint yet creating a coherent harmonic logic that would be difficult to achieve in the heat of live improvisation||the use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago||musical notation enables s-era performers to sing a choral work from the renaissance era or a baroque concerto with many of the features of the music the melodies lyrics forms and rhythms being reproduced.that said the score does allow the interpreter to make choices on how to perform a historical work||for example if the tempo is written with an italian instruction e.g||allegro it is not known exactly how fast the piece should be played||as well in the baroque era many works that were designed for basso continuo accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument harpsichord lute etc||should play the chords which are not notated in the part only a figured bass symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer||the performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece including the phrasing of melodies the time taken during fermatas held notes or pauses and the use or choice not to use of effects such as vibrato or glissando these effects are possible on various stringed brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice||although classical music in the has lost most of its tradition for musical improvisation from the baroque era to the romantic era there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era||in the baroque era organ performers would improvise preludes keyboard performers playing harpsichord would improvise chords from the figured bass symbols beneath the bass notes of the basso continuo part and both vocal and instrumental performers would improvise musical ornaments||johann sebastian bach was particularly noted for his complex improvisations||during the classical era the composer-performer mozart was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles||during the classical era some virtuoso soloists would improvise the cadenza sections of a concerto||during the romantic era beethoven would improvise at the piano||for more information see improvisation.||the instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-th century often much earlier and systematised in the th and th centuries||they consist of the instruments found in an orchestra or in a concert band together with several other solo instruments such as the piano harpsichord and organ||the symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music and includes members of the string woodwind brass and percussion families of instruments||the concert band consists of members of the woodwind brass and percussion families||it generally has a larger variety and number of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section||however many concert bands use a double bass||the vocal practices changed over the classical period from the single line monophonic gregorian chant done by monks in the medieval period to the complex polyphonic choral works of the renaissance and subsequent periods which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time.||many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist but in different forms||medieval instruments included the flute the recorder and plucked string instruments like the lute||as well early versions of the organ and fiddle or vielle existed||medieval instruments in europe had most commonly been used singly often self accompanied with a drone note or occasionally in parts||from at least as early as the th century through the th century there was a division of instruments into haut loud shrill outdoor instruments and bas quieter more intimate instruments||during the earlier medieval period the vocal music from the liturgical genre predominantly gregorian chant was monophonic using a single unaccompanied vocal melody line||polyphonic vocal genres which used multiple independent vocal melodies began to develop during the high medieval era becoming prevalent by the later th and early th century.||many instruments originated during the renaissance others were variations of or improvements upon instruments that had existed previously||some have survived to the present day others have disappeared only to be re-created in order to perform music on period instruments||as in the modern day instruments may be classified as brass strings percussion and woodwind||brass instruments in the renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were members of guilds and they included the slide trumpet the wooden cornet the valveless trumpet and the sackbut||stringed instruments included the viol the rebec the harp-like lyre the hurdy-gurdy the lute the guitar the cittern the bandora and the orpharion||keyboard instruments with strings included the harpsichord and the virginals||percussion instruments include the triangle the jew's harp the tambourine the bells the rumble-pot and various kinds of drums||woodwind instruments included the double reed shawm the reed pipe the bagpipe the transverse flute the recorder the dulcian and the crumhorn||vocal music in the renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate polyphonic style||the principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire renaissance period were masses and motets with some other developments towards the end especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms such as the madrigal for their own designs||towards the end of the period the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody the madrigal comedy and the intermedio are seen||around italian composer jacopo peri wrote dafne the first work to be called an opera today||he also composed euridice the first opera to have survived to the present day.||baroque instruments included some instruments from the earlier periods e.g||the hurdy-gurdy and recorder and a number of new instruments e.g the oboe bassoon cello contrabass and fortepiano||some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse such as the shawm and the wooden cornet||the key baroque instruments for strings included the violin viol viola viola d'amore cello contrabass lute theorbo which often played the basso continuo parts mandolin cittern baroque guitar harp and hurdy-gurdy||woodwinds included the baroque flute baroque oboe rackett recorder and the bassoon||brass instruments included the cornett natural horn baroque trumpet serpent and the trombone||keyboard instruments included the clavichord the harpsichord the pipe organ and later in the period the fortepiano an early version of the piano||percussion instruments included the timpani snare drum tambourine and the castanets||one major difference between baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in baroque ensembles were much less standardized||whereas a classical era string quartet consists almost exclusively of two violins a viola and a cello a baroque or classical-era group accompanying a soloist or opera could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments e.g||pipe organ harpsichord or clavichord additional stringed chordal instruments e.g||a lute and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo including bowed strings woodwinds and brass instruments e.g||a cello contrabass viol bassoon serpent etc.||vocal developments in the baroque era included the development of opera types such as opera seria and opéra comique and related forms such as oratorios and cantatas.||the term classical music has two meanings: the broader meaning includes all western art music from the medieval era to the and the specific meaning refers to the art music from the to the early s—the period of wolfgang amadeus mozart joseph haydn and ludwig van beethoven||this section is about the more specific meaning||classical era musicians continued to use many of instruments from the baroque era such as the cello contrabass recorder trombone timpani fortepiano the precursor to the modern piano and organ||while some baroque instruments fell into disuse e.g||the theorbo and rackett many baroque instruments were changed into the versions that are still in use today such as the baroque violin which became the violin the baroque oboe which became the oboe and the baroque trumpet which transitioned to the regular valved trumpet||during the classical era the stringed instruments used in orchestra and chamber music such as string quartets were standardized as the four instruments which form the string section of the orchestra: the violin viola cello and double bass||baroque-era stringed instruments such as fretted bowed viols were phased out||woodwinds included the basset clarinet basset horn clarinette d'amour the classical clarinet the chalumeau the flute oboe and bassoon||keyboard instruments included the clavichord and the fortepiano||while the harpsichord was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the and it fell out of use in the end of the century||brass instruments included the buccin the ophicleide a replacement for the bass serpent which was the precursor of the tuba and the natural horn.||in the romantic era the modern piano with a more powerful sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate-sounding fortepiano||in the orchestra the existing classical instruments and sections were retained string section woodwinds brass and percussion but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller bigger sound||for example while a baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players a romantic orchestra could have as many as ten||as music grew more expressive the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many romantic composers||new woodwind instruments were added such as the contrabassoon bass clarinet and piccolo and new percussion instruments were added including xylophones snare drums celestas a bell-like keyboard instrument bells and triangles large orchestral harps and even wind machines for sound effects||saxophones appear in some scores from the late th century onwards||while appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works for example maurice ravel's orchestration of modest mussorgsky's pictures at an exhibition and sergei rachmaninoff's symphonic dances the saxophone is included in other works such as ravel's boléro sergei prokofiev's romeo and juliet suites and and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble||the euphonium is featured in a few late romantic and th-century works usually playing parts marked tenor tuba including gustav holst's the planets and richard strauss's ein heldenleben||the wagner tuba a modified member of the horn family appears in richard wagner's cycle der ring des nibelungen and several other works by strauss béla bartók and others it has a prominent role in anton bruckner's symphony no||in e major||cornets appear in pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky's ballet swan lake claude debussy's la mer and several orchestral works by hector berlioz||unless these instruments are played by members doubling on another instrument for example a trombone player changing to euphonium for a certain passage orchestras will use freelance musicians to augment their regular rosters.||modernism in music is a philosophical and aesthetic stance underlying the period of change and development in musical language that occurred from to a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic melodic sonic and rhythmic aspects of music and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of modernism in the arts of the time||the operative word most associated with it is innovation||its leading feature is a linguistic plurality which is to say that no single music genre ever assumed a dominant position.||contemporary classical music is the period that came into

assigned to the vice president||the officiating priest at certain anglican religious services too is sometimes called the president in this sense||however the most common modern usage is as the title of a head of state in a republic||in pre-revolutionary france the president of a parlement evolved into a powerful magistrate a member of the so-called noblesse de robe nobility of the gown with considerable judicial as well as administrative authority||the name referred to his primary role of presiding over trials and other hearings||in the th and th centuries seats in the parlements including presidencies became effectively hereditary since the holder of the office could ensure that it would pass to an heir by paying the crown a special tax known as the paulette||the post of first president premier président however could only be held by the king's nominees||the parlements were abolished by the french revolution||in modern france the chief judge of a court is known as its president président de la cour||the first usage of the word president to denote the highest official in a government was during the commonwealth of england||after the abolition of the monarchy the english council of state whose members were elected by the house of commons became the executive government of the commonwealth||the council of state was the successor of the privy council which had previously been headed by the lord president its successor the council of state was also headed by a lord president the first of which was john bradshaw||however the lord president alone was not head of state because that office was vested in the council as a whole||the modern usage of the term president to designate a single person who is the head of state of a republic can be traced directly to the united states constitution of which created the office of president of the united states||previous american governments had included presidents such as the president of the continental congress or the president of the massachusetts provincial congress but these were presiding officers in the older sense with no executive authority||it has been suggested that the executive use of the term was borrowed from early american colleges and universities which were usually headed by a president||british universities were headed by an official called the chancellor typically a ceremonial position while the chief administrator held the title of vice-chancellor||but america's first institutions of higher learning such as harvard university and yale university didn't resemble a full-sized university so much as one of its constituent colleges||a number of colleges at cambridge university featured an official called the president||the head for instance of magdalene college cambridge was called the master and his second the president||the first president of harvard henry dunster had been educated at magdalene||some have speculated that he borrowed the term out of a sense of humility considering himself only a temporary place-holder||the presiding official of yale college originally a rector after the usage of continental european universities became president in ||numerous definitions of law have been put forward over the centuries||the third new international dictionary from merriam-webster defines law as: law is a binding custom or practice of a community a rule or mode of conduct or action that is prescribed or formally recognized as binding by a supreme controlling authority or is made obligatory by a sanction as an edict decree rescript order ordinance statute resolution rule judicial decision or usage made recognized or enforced by the controlling authority||the dictionary of the history of ideas published by scribner's in defined the concept of law accordingly as: a legal system is the most explicit institutionalized and complex mode of regulating human conduct||at the same time it plays only one part in the congeries of rules which influence behavior for social and moral rules of a less institutionalized kind are also of great importance.||there have been several attempts to produce a universally acceptable definition of law||in one source indicated that no such definition could be produced||mccoubrey and white said that the question what is law? has no simple answer||glanville williams said that the meaning of the word law depends on the context in which that word is used||he said that for example early customary law and municipal law were contexts where the word law had two different and irreconcilable meanings||thurman arnold said that it is obvious that it is impossible to define the word law and that it is also equally obvious that the struggle to define that word should not ever be abandoned||it is possible to take the view that there is no need to define the word law e.g||let's forget about generalities and get down to cases.||the history of law links closely to the development of civilization||ancient egyptian law dating as far back as bc contained a civil code that was probably broken into twelve books||it was based on the concept of ma'at characterised by tradition rhetorical speech social equality and impartiality||by the nd century bc the ancient sumerian ruler ur-nammu had formulated the first law code which consisted of casuistic statements if … then ...||around bc king hammurabi further developed babylonian law by codifying and inscribing it in stone||hammurabi placed several copies of his law code throughout the kingdom of babylon as stelae for the entire public to see this became known as the codex hammurabi||the most intact copy of these stelae was discovered in the th century by british assyriologists and has since been fully transliterated and translated into various languages including english italian german and french.the old testament dates back to bc and takes the form of moral imperatives as recommendations for a good society||the small greek city-state ancient athens from about the th century bc was the first society to be based on broad inclusion of its citizenry excluding women and the slave class||however athens had no legal science or single word for law relying instead on the three-way distinction between divine law thémis human decree nomos and custom díkē||yet ancient greek law contained major constitutional innovations in the development of democracy.roman law was heavily influenced by greek philosophy but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated||over the centuries between the rise and decline of the roman empire law was adapted to cope with the changing social situations and underwent major codification under theodosius ii and justinian i||although codes were replaced by custom and case law during the dark ages roman law was rediscovered around the th century when medieval legal scholars began to research roman codes and adapt their concepts||latin legal maxims called brocards were compiled for guidance||in medieval england royal courts developed a body of precedent which later became the common law||a europe-wide law merchant was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws||the law merchant a precursor to modern commercial law emphasised the freedom to contract and alienability of property||as nationalism grew in the th and th centuries the law merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes||the napoleonic and german codes became the most influential||in contrast to english common law which consists of enormous tomes of case law codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply||however today there are signs that civil and common law are converging||eu law is codified in treaties but develops through the precedent laid down by the european court of justice||ancient india and china represent distinct traditions of law and have historically had independent schools of legal theory and practice||the arthashastra probably compiled around ad although it contains older material and the manusmriti c||– ad were foundational treatises in india and comprise texts considered authoritative legal guidance||manu's central philosophy was tolerance and pluralism and was cited across southeast asia||this hindu tradition along with islamic law was supplanted by the common law when india became part of the british empire||malaysia brunei singapore and hong kong also adopted the common law||the eastern asia legal tradition reflects a unique blend of secular and religious influences||japan was the first country to begin modernising its legal system along western lines by importing bits of the french but mostly the german civil code||this partly reflected germany's status as a rising power in the late th century||similarly traditional chinese law gave way to westernisation towards the final years of the qing dynasty in the form of six private law codes based mainly on the japanese model of german law||today taiwanese law retains the closest affinity to the codifications from that period because of the split between chiang kai-shek's nationalists who fled there and mao zedong's communists who won control of the mainland in ||the current legal infrastructure in the people's republic of china was heavily influenced by soviet socialist law which essentially inflates administrative law at the expense of private law rights||due to rapid industrialisation today china is undergoing a process of reform at least in terms of economic if not social and political rights||a new contract code in represented a move away from administrative domination||furthermore after negotiations lasting fifteen years in china joined the world trade organization.||the philosophy of law is commonly known as general jurisprudence||normative jurisprudence asks what should law be? while analytic jurisprudence asks what is law? john austin's utilitarian answer was that law is commands backed by threat of sanctions from a sovereign to whom people have a habit of obedience||natural lawyers on the other side such as jean-jacques rousseau argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature||the concept of natural law emerged in ancient greek philosophy concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice and re-entered the mainstream of western culture through the writings of thomas aquinas notably his treatise on law||hugo grotius the founder of a purely rationalistic system of natural law argued that law arises from both a social impulse—as aristotle had indicated—and reason||immanuel kant believed a moral imperative requires laws be chosen as though they should hold as universal laws of nature||jeremy bentham and his student austin following david hume believed that this conflated the is and what ought to be problem||bentham and austin argued for law's positivism that real law is entirely separate from morality||kant was also criticised by friedrich nietzsche who rejected the principle of equality and believed that law emanates from the will to power and cannot be labelled as moral or immoral.in the austrian philosopher hans kelsen continued the positivist tradition in his book the pure theory of law||kelsen believed that although law is separate from morality it is endowed with normativity meaning we ought to obey it||while laws are positive is statements e.g||the fine for reversing on a highway is € law tells us what we should do||thus each legal system can be hypothesised to have a basic norm grundnorm instructing us to obey||kelsen's major opponent carl schmitt rejected both positivism and the idea of the rule of law because he did not accept the primacy of abstract normative principles over concrete political positions and decisions||therefore schmitt advocated a jurisprudence of the exception state of emergency which denied that legal norms could encompass all of political experience||later in the th century h||l||a||hart attacked austin for his simplifications and kelsen for his fictions in the concept of law||hart argued law is a system of rules divided into primary rules of conduct and secondary ones rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules||secondary rules are further divided into rules of adjudication to resolve legal disputes rules of change allowing laws to be varied and the rule of recognition allowing laws to be identified as valid||two of hart's students continued the debate: in his book law's empire ronald dworkin attacked hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue||dworkin argues that law is an interpretive concept that requires judges to find the best fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute given their constitutional traditions||joseph raz on the other hand defended the positivist outlook and criticised hart's soft social thesis approach in the authority of law||raz argues that law is authority identifiable purely through social sources and without reference to moral reasoning||in his view any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authoritative instruments in mediation are best left to sociology rather than jurisprudence.||one definition is that law is a system of rules and guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern behaviour||in the concept of law hart argued law is a system of rules austin said law was the command of a sovereign backed by the threat of a sanction dworkin describes law as an interpretive concept to achieve justice in his text titled law's empire and raz argues law is an authority to mediate people's interests||holmes said the prophecies of what the courts will do in fact and nothing more pretentious are what i mean by the law||in his treatise on law aquinas argues that law is a rational ordering of things which concern the common good that is promulgated by whoever is charged with the care of the community||this definition has both positivist and naturalist elements.||in the th century adam smith presented a philosophical foundation for explaining the relationship between law and economics||the discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and u.s||antitrust law||the most influential proponents such as richard posner and oliver williamson and the so-called chicago school of economists and lawyers including milton friedman and gary becker are generally advocates of deregulation and privatisation and are hostile to state regulation or what they see as restrictions on the operation of free markets||the most prominent economic analyst of law is nobel prize winner ronald coase whose first major article the nature of the firm argued that the reason for the existence of firms companies partnerships etc||a government is the system to govern a state or community.the word government derives ultimately from the greek verb κυβερνάω [kubernáo] meaning to steer with gubernaculum rudder the metaphorical sense being attested in plato's ship of state.the columbia encyclopedia defines government as a system of social control under which the right to make laws and the right to enforce them is vested in a particular group in society.while all types of organizations have governance the word government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately independent national governments on earth as well as their subsidiary organizations.in the commonwealth of nations the word government is also used more narrowly to refer to the ministry collective executive a collective group of people that exercises executive authority in a state or metonymically to the governing cabinet as part of the executive||finally government is also sometimes used in english as a synonym for governance.||the moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time however history does record the formations of early governments||about years ago the first small city-states appeared||by the third to second millenniums bc some of these had developed into larger governed areas: sumer ancient egypt the indus valley civilization and the yellow river civilization.the development of agriculture and water control projects were a catalyst for the development of governments||for many thousands of years when people were hunter-gatherers and small scale farmers humans lived in small non-hierarchical and self-sufficient communities||on occasion a chief of a tribe was elected by various rituals or tests of strength to govern his tribe sometimes with a group of elder tribesmen as a council||the human ability to precisely communicate abstract learned information allowed humans to become ever more effective at agriculture and that allowed for ever increasing population densities||david christian explains how this resulted in states with laws and governments: as farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities interactions between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until in a striking parallel with star formation new structures suddenly appeared together with a new level of complexity||like stars cities and states reorganize and energize the smaller objects within their gravitational field||starting at the end of the th century the prevalence of republican forms of government grew||the glorious revolution in england the american revolution and the french revolution contributed to the growth of representative forms of government||the soviet union was the first large country to have a communist government||since the fall of the berlin wall liberal democracy has become an even more prevalent form of government.in the nineteenth and twentieth century there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level||this included the regulation of corporations and the development of the welfare state.||in political science it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of polities as typologies of political systems are not obvious||it is especially important in the political science fields of comparative politics and international relations||like all categories discerned within forms of government the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined||superficially all governments have an official or ideal form||the united states is a constitutional republic while the former soviet union was a socialist republic||however self-identification is not objective and as kopstein and lichbach argue defining regimes can be tricky||for example elections are a defining characteristic of an electoral democracy but in practice elections in the former soviet union were not free and fair and took place in a one-party state||voltaire argued that the holy roman empire is neither holy nor roman nor an empire||many governments that officially call themselves a democratic republic are not democratic nor a republic they are usually a dictatorship de facto||communist dictatorships have been especially prone to use this term||for example the official name of north vietnam was the democratic republic of vietnam||china uses a variant the people's republic of china||thus in many practical classifications it would not be considered democratic||identifying a form of government is also difficult because many political systems originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by parties naming themselves after those movements all with competing political-ideologies||experience with those movements in power and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves||other complications include general non-consensus or deliberate distortion or bias of reasonable technical definitions to political ideologies and associated forms of governing due to the nature of politics in the modern era||for example: the meaning of conservatism in the united states has little in common with the way the word's definition is used elsewhere||as ribuffo notes what americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism||since the conservatism in the united states has been chiefly associated with the republican party||however during the era of segregation many southern democrats were conservatives and they played a key role in the conservative coalition that controlled congress from to .||every country in the world is ruled by a system of governance that combines at least three or more political or economic attributes||additionally opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist||shades of gray are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification||even the most liberal democracies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most tyrannical dictatorships must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for pigeonholing governments into narrow categories||examples include the claims of the united states as being a plutocracy rather than a democracy since some american voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy super pacs.||the classical greek philosopher plato discusses five types of regimes: aristocracy timocracy oligarchy democracy and tyranny||plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for||the tyrannical man would represent tyranny for example||these five regimes progressively degenerate starting with aristocracy at the top and tyranny at the bottom.||one method of classifying governments is through which people have the authority to rule||this can either be one person an autocracy such as monarchy a select group of people an aristocracy or the people as a whole a democracy such as a republic||the division of governments as monarchy aristocracy and democracy has been used since aristotle's politics||in his book leviathan thomas hobbes expands on this classification||the difference of commonwealths consisteth in the difference of the sovereign or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude||and because the sovereignty is either in one man or in an assembly of more than one and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter or not every one but certain men distinguished from the rest it is manifest there can be but three kinds of commonwealth||for the representative must needs be one man or more and if more then it is the assembly of all or but of a part||when the representative is one man then is the commonwealth a monarchy when an assembly of all that will come together then it is a democracy or popular commonwealth when an assembly of a part only then it is called an aristocracy||other kind of commonwealth there can be none: for either one or more or all must have the sovereign power which i have shown to be indivisible entire.||an autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection.a despotism is a government ruled by a single entity with absolute power whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control except perhaps for implicit threat||that entity may be an individual as in an autocracy or it may be a group as in an oligarchy||the word despotism means to rule in the fashion of despots.a monarchy is where a family or group of families rarely another type of group called the royalty represents national identity with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals called the monarch who mostly rule kingdoms||the actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical crowned republic to partial and restricted constitutional monarchy to completely despotic absolute monarchy||traditionally and in most cases the post of the monarch is inherited but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected.||aristocracy greek ἀριστοκρατία aristokratía from ἄριστος aristos excellent and κράτος kratos power is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small privileged ruling class.many monarchies were aristocracies although in modern constitutional monarchies the monarch himself or herself has little real power||the term aristocracy could also refer to the non-peasant non-servant and non-city classes in the feudal system||an oligarchy is ruled by a small group of segregated powerful or influential people who usually share similar interests or family relations||these people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally||an oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things||an oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic||an oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.some historical examples of oligarchy are the former union of soviet socialist republics||some critics of representative democracy think of the united states as an oligarchy||the athenian democracy used sortition to elect candidates almost always male greek educated citizens holding a minimum of land wealth and status.a theocracy is rule by a religious elite a system of governance composed of religious institutions in which the state and the church are traditionally or constitutionally the same entity||the use of prisons can be traced back to the rise of the state as a form of social organization||corresponding with the advent of the state was the development of written language which enabled the creation of formalized legal codes as official guidelines for society||the best known of these early legal codes is the code of hammurabi written in babylon around bc||the penalties for violations of the laws in hammurabi's code were almost exclusively centered on the concept of lex talionis the law of retaliation whereby people were punished as a form of vengeance often by the victims themselves||this notion of punishment as vengeance or retaliation can also be found in many other legal codes from early civilizations including the ancient sumerian codes the indian manama dharma astra the hermes trismegistus of egypt and the israelite mosaic law||some ancient greek philosophers such as plato began to develop ideas of using punishment to reform offenders instead of simply using it as retribution||imprisonment as a penalty was used initially for those who could not afford to pay their fines||eventually since impoverished athenians could not pay their fines leading to indefinite periods of imprisonment time limits were set instead||the prison in ancient athens was known as the desmoterion place of chains.the romans were among the first to use prisons as a form of punishment rather than simply for detention||a variety of existing structures were used to house prisoners such as metal cages basements of public buildings and quarries||one of the most notable roman prisons was the mamertine prison established around b.c||by ancus marcius||the mamertine prison was located within a sewer system beneath ancient rome and contained a large network of dungeons where prisoners were held in squalid conditions contaminated with human waste||forced labor on public works projects was also a common form of punishment||in many cases citizens were sentenced to slavery often in ergastula a primitive form of prison where unruly slaves were chained to workbenches and performed hard labor.during the middle ages in europe castles fortresses and the basements of public buildings were often used as makeshift prisons||the possession of the right and the capability to imprison citizens however granted an air of legitimacy to officials at all levels of government from kings to regional courts to city councils and the ability to have someone imprisoned or killed served as a signifier of who in society possessed power or authority over others||another common punishment was sentencing people to galley slavery which involved chaining prisoners together in the bottoms of ships and forcing them to row on naval or merchant vessels.||from the late th century and during the th century popular resistance to public execution and torture became more widespread both in europe and in the united states||particularly under the bloody code with few sentencing alternatives imposition of the death penalty for petty crimes such as theft was proving increasingly unpopular with the public many jurors were refusing to convict defendants of petty crimes when they knew the defendants would be sentenced to death||rulers began looking for means to punish and control their subjects in a way that did not cause people to associate them with spectacles of tyrannical and sadistic violence||they developed systems of mass incarceration often with hard labor as a solution||the prison reform movement that arose at this time was heavily influenced by two somewhat contradictory philosophies||the first was based in enlightenment ideas of utilitarianism and rationalism and suggested that prisons should simply be used as a more effective substitute for public corporal punishments such as whipping hanging etc||this theory referred to as deterrence claims that the primary purpose of prisons is to be so harsh and terrifying that they deter people from committing crimes out of fear of going to prison||the second theory which saw prisons as a form of rehabilitation or moral reform was based on religious ideas that equated crime with sin and saw prisons as a place to instruct prisoners in christian morality obedience and proper behavior||these later reformers believed that prisons could be constructed as humane institutions of moral instruction and that prisoners' behavior could be corrected so that when they were released they would be model members of society.the concept of the modern prison largely remained unknown until the early th-century||punishment usually consisted of physical forms of punishment including capital punishment mutilation flagellation whipping branding and non-physical punishments such as public shaming rituals like the stocks||from the middle ages up to the th and th centuries in europe imprisonment was rarely used as a punishment in its own right and prisons were mainly to hold those awaiting trial and convicts awaiting punishment||however an important innovation at the time was the bridewell house of corrections located at bridewell palace in london which resulted in the building of other houses of correction||these houses held mostly petty offenders vagrants and the disorderly local poor||in these facilities inmates were given jobs and through prison labor they were taught how to work for a living||by the end of the th century houses of correction were absorbed into local prison facilities under the control of the local justice of the peace.||england used penal transportation of convicted criminals and others generally young and poor for a term of indentured servitude within the general population of british america between the and ||the transportation act made this option available for lesser crimes or offered it by discretion as a longer-term alternative to the death penalty which could theoretically be imposed for the growing number of offenses||the substantial expansion of transportation was the first major innovation in eighteenth-century british penal practice||transportation to america was abruptly suspended by the criminal law act geo||c||with the start of the american rebellion||while sentencing to transportation continued the act instituted a punishment policy of hard labour instead||the suspension of transport also prompted the use of prisons for punishment and the initial start of a prison building program||britain would resume transportation to specifically planned penal colonies in australia between and ||gaols at the time were run as business ventures and contained both felons and debtors the latter were often housed with their wives and younger children||the gaolers made their money by charging the inmates for food drink and other services and the system was generally corruptible||one reform of the seventeenth century was the establishment of the london bridewell as a house of correction for women and children||it was the first facility to make any medical services available to prisoners||with the widely used alternative of penal transportation halted in the the immediate need for additional penal accommodations emerged||given the undeveloped institutional facilities old sailing vessels termed hulks were the most readily available and expandable choice to be used as places of temporary confinement||while conditions on these ships were generally appalling their use and the labor thus provided set a precedent which persuaded many people that mass incarceration and labour were viable methods of crime prevention and punishment||the turn of the th century would see the first movement toward prison reform and by the the first state prisons and correctional facilities were built thereby inaugurating the modern prison facilities available today||france also sent criminals to overseas penal colonies including louisiana in the early th century||medicine uk: listen us: listen is the science and practice of the diagnosis treatment and prevention of disease||the word medicine is derived from latin medicus meaning a physician.||medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology||modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the western world while in developing countries such as parts of africa or asia the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners||even in the developed world however evidence-based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice for example a survey of literature reviews found that about of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm.in modern clinical practice physicians personally assess patients in order to diagnose treat and prevent disease using clinical judgment||the doctor-patient relationship typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient's medical history and medical record followed by a medical interview and a physical examination||basic diagnostic medical devices e.g||stethoscope tongue depressor are typically used||after examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms the doctor may order medical tests e.g||blood tests take a biopsy or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies||differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided||during the encounter properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust||the medical encounter is then documented in the medical record which is a legal document in many jurisdictions||follow-ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure and specialists follow a similar process||the diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue||the components of the medical interview and encounter are: chief complaint cc: the reason for the current medical visit||these are the 'symptoms.' they are in the patient's own words and are recorded along with the duration of each one||also called 'chief concern' or 'presenting complaint'||history of present illness hpi: the chronological order of events of symptoms and further clarification of each symptom||distinguishable from history of previous illness often called past medical history pmh||medical history comprises hpi and pmh||current activity: occupation hobbies what the patient actually does||medications rx: what drugs the patient takes including prescribed over-the-counter and home remedies as well as alternative and herbal medicines/herbal remedies||allergies are also recorded||past medical history pmh/pmhx: concurrent medical problems past hospitalizations and operations injuries past infectious diseases or vaccinations history of known allergies||social history sh: birthplace residences marital history social and economic status habits including diet medications tobacco alcohol||family history fh: listing of diseases in the family that may impact the patient||a family tree is sometimes used||review of systems ros or systems inquiry: a set of additional questions to ask which may be missed on hpi: a general enquiry have you noticed any weight loss change in sleep quality fevers lumps and bumps? etc||followed by questions on the body's main organ systems heart lungs digestive tract urinary tract etc..the physical examination is the examination of the patient for medical signs of disease which are objective and observable in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable||the healthcare provider uses the senses of sight hearing touch and sometimes smell e.g||in infection uremia diabetic ketoacidosis||four actions are the basis of physical examination: inspection palpation feel percussion tap to determine resonance characteristics and auscultation listen generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.the clinical examination involves the study of: vital signs including height weight body temperature blood pressure pulse respiration rate and hemoglobin oxygen saturation general appearance of the patient and specific indicators of disease nutritional status presence of jaundice pallor or clubbing skin head eye ear nose and throat heent cardiovascular heart and blood vessels respiratory large airways and lungs abdomen and rectum genitalia and pregnancy if the patient is or could be pregnant musculoskeletal including spine and extremities neurological consciousness awareness brain vision cranial nerves spinal cord and peripheral nerves psychiatric orientation mental state evidence of abnormal perception or thought.it is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above||the treatment plan may include ordering additional medical laboratory tests and medical imaging studies starting therapy referral to a specialist or watchful observation||follow-up may be advised||depending upon the health insurance plan and the managed care system various forms of utilization review such as prior authorization of tests may place barriers on accessing expensive services.the medical decision-making mdm process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses the differential diagnoses along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem||on subsequent visits the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history symptoms physical findings and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations.||contemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems||legal credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments augmented on occasion by international organizations such as churches||the characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided||from ancient times christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the catholic church today remains the largest non-government provider of medical services in the world||advanced industrial countries with the exception of the united states and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single-payer health care system or compulsory private or co-operative health insurance||this is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay||delivery may be via private medical practices or by state-owned hospitals and clinics or by charities most commonly by a combination of all three||most tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole||in such societies healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self-insured it either directly or as part of an employment contract or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly||transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system||access to information on conditions treatments quality and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and therefore the incentives of medical professionals||while the us healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness new legislation may encourage greater openness||there is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other.||provision of medical care is classified into primary secondary and tertiary care categories||primary care medical services are provided by physicians physician assistants nurse practitioners or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care||these occur in physician offices clinics nursing homes schools home visits and other places close to patients||about of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider||these include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes||secondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient||in many cases terms such as disease disorder morbidity sickness and illness are used interchangeably||there are situations however when specific terms are considered preferable||disease the term disease broadly refers to any condition that impairs the normal functioning of the body||for this reason diseases are associated with dysfunctioning of the body's normal homeostatic processes||commonly the term is used to refer specifically to infectious diseases which are clinically evident diseases that result from the presence of pathogenic microbial agents including viruses bacteria fungi protozoa multicellular organisms and aberrant proteins known as prions||an infection or colonization that does not and will not produce clinically evident impairment of normal functioning such as the presence of the normal bacteria and yeasts in the gut or of a passenger virus is not considered a disease||by contrast an infection that is asymptomatic during its incubation period but expected to produce symptoms later is usually considered a disease||non-infectious diseases are all other diseases including most forms of cancer heart disease and genetic disease||acquired disease an acquired disease is one that began at some point during one's lifetime as opposed to disease that was already present at birth which is congenital disease||acquired sounds like it could mean caught via contagion but it simply means acquired sometime after birth||it also sounds like it could imply secondary disease but acquired disease can be primary disease||acute disease an acute disease is one of a short-term nature acute the term sometimes also connotes a fulminant nature chronic condition or chronic disease a chronic disease is one that persists over time often characterized six months or more||congenital disorder or congenital disease a congenital disorder is one that is present at birth||it is often a genetic disease or disorder and can be inherited||it can also be the result of a vertically transmitted infection from the mother such as hiv/aids||genetic disease a genetic disorder or disease is caused by one or more genetic mutations||it is often inherited but some mutations are random and de novo||hereditary or inherited disease a hereditary disease is a type of genetic disease caused by genetic mutations that are hereditary and can run in families iatrogenic disease an iatrogenic disease or condition is one that caused by medical intervention whether as a side effect of a treatment or as an inadvertent outcome||idiopathic disease an idiopathic disease has an unknown cause or source||as medical science has advanced many diseases with entirely unknown causes have had some aspects of their sources explained and therefore shed their idiopathic status||for example when germs were discovered it became known that they were a cause of infection but particular germs and diseases had not been linked||in another example it is known that autoimmunity is the cause of some forms of diabetes mellitus type even though the particular molecular pathways by which it works are not yet understood||it is also common to know certain factors are associated with certain diseases||however association and causality are two very different phenomena as a third cause might be producing the disease as well as an associated phenomenon||incurable disease a disease that cannot be cured||incurable diseases are not necessarily terminal diseases and sometimes a disease's symptoms can be treated sufficiently for the disease to have little or no impact on quality of life||primary disease a primary disease is a disease that is due to a root cause of illness as opposed to secondary disease which is a sequela or complication that is caused by the primary disease||for example a common cold is a primary disease where rhinitis is a possible secondary disease or sequela||a doctor must determine what primary disease a cold or a bacterial infection is causing a patient's secondary rhinitis when deciding whether or not to prescribe antibiotics||secondary disease a secondary disease is a disease that is a sequela or complication of a prior causal disease which is referred to as the primary disease or simply the underlying cause root cause||for example a bacterial infection can be primary wherein a healthy person is exposed to a bacteria and becomes infected or it can be secondary to a primary cause that predisposes the body to infection||for example a primary viral infection that weakens the immune system could lead to a secondary bacterial infection||similarly a primary burn that creates an open wound could provide an entry point for bacteria and lead to a secondary bacterial infection||terminal disease a terminal disease is one that is expected to have the inevitable result of death||previously aids was a terminal disease it is now incurable but can be managed indefinitely using medications||illness the terms illness and sickness are both generally used as a synonym for disease||however the term illness is occasionally used to refer specifically to the patient's personal experience of his or her disease||in this model it is possible for a person to have a disease without being ill to have an objectively definable but asymptomatic medical condition such as a subclinical infection and to be ill without being diseased such as when a person perceives a normal experience as a medical condition or medicalizes a non-disease situation in his or her life—for example a person who feels unwell as a result of embarrassment and who interprets those feelings as sickness rather than normal emotions||symptoms of illness are often not directly the result of infection but a collection of evolved responses—sickness behavior by the body—that helps clear infection and promote recovery||such aspects of illness can include lethargy depression loss of appetite sleepiness hyperalgesia and inability to concentrate||disorder a disorder is a functional abnormality or disturbance||medical disorders can be categorized into mental disorders physical disorders genetic disorders emotional and behavioral disorders and functional disorders||the term disorder is often considered more value-neutral and less stigmatizing than the terms disease or illness and therefore is a preferred terminology in some circumstances||in mental health the term mental disorder is used as a way of acknowledging the complex interaction of biological social and psychological factors in psychiatric conditions||however the term disorder is also used in many other areas of medicine primarily to identify physical disorders that are not caused by infectious organisms such as metabolic disorders||medical condition a medical condition is a broad term that includes all diseases lesions disorders or nonpathologic condition that normally receives medical treatment such as pregnancy or childbirth||while the term medical condition generally includes mental illnesses in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness injury or disease except for mental illnesses||the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all mental disorders uses the term general medical condition to refer to all diseases illnesses and injuries except for mental disorders||there is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed but some information has been inferred by studying lice which estimates the introduction of clothing at roughly – years ago.||the most obvious function of clothing is to improve the comfort of the wearer by protecting the wearer from the elements||in hot climates clothing provides protection from sunburn or wind damage while in cold climates its thermal insulation properties are generally more important||shelter usually reduces the functional need for clothing||for example coats hats gloves and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm home particularly if one is living or sleeping there||similarly clothing has seasonal and regional aspects so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones||clothing performs a range of social and cultural functions such as individual occupational and gender differentiation and social status||in many societies norms about clothing reflect standards of modesty religion gender and social status||clothing may also function as a form of adornment and an expression of personal taste or style||clothing can be and has in the past been made from a very wide variety of materials||materials have ranged from leather and furs to woven materials to elaborate and exotic natural and synthetic fabrics||not all body coverings are regarded as clothing||articles carried rather than worn such as purses worn on a single part of the body and easily removed scarves worn purely for adornment jewelry or those that serve a function other than protection eyeglasses are normally considered accessories rather than clothing except for shoes||clothing protects against many things that might injure the uncovered human body||clothes protect people from the elements including rain snow wind and other weather as well as from the sun||however clothing that is too sheer thin small tight etc||offers less protection||appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport||the japanese word for japan is 日本 which is pronounced nihon or nippon and literally means the origin of the sun||the character nichi 日 means sun or day hon 本 means base or origin||the compound therefore means origin of the sun and is the source of the popular western epithet land of the rising sun.the earliest record of the name nihon appears in the chinese historical records of the tang dynasty the old book of tang||at the end of the seventh century a delegation from japan requested that nihon be used as the name of their country||this name may have its origin in a letter sent in and recorded in the official history of the sui dynasty||prince shōtoku the regent of japan sent a mission to china with a letter in which he called himself the emperor of the land where the sun rises 日出處天子||the message said: here i the emperor of the country where the sun rises send a letter to the emperor of the country where the sun sets||how are you[?]”||prior to the adoption of nihon other terms such as yamato 大和 or great wa and wakoku 倭国 were used||the term wa 和 is a homophone of wo 倭 pronounced wa by the japanese which has been used by the chinese as a designation for the japanese as early as the third century three kingdoms period||another form of wa 委 wei in chinese was used for an early state in japan called nakoku during the han dynasty||however the japanese disliked some connotation of wa 倭 which has been associated in china with concepts like dwarf or pygmy and it was therefore replaced with the substitute character wa 和 meaning togetherness harmony.the english word japan possibly derives from the historical chinese pronunciation of 日本||the old mandarin or possibly early wu chinese pronunciation of japan was recorded by marco polo as cipangu||in modern shanghainese a wu dialect the pronunciation of characters 日本 japan is zeppen [zəʔpən]||the old malay word for japan japun or japang was borrowed from a southern coastal chinese dialect probably fukienese or ningpo – and this malay word was encountered by portuguese traders in southeast asia in the th century||these early portuguese traders then brought the word to europe||the first record of this name in english is in a book published in and spelled giapan in a translation of a letter written by a portuguese jesuit luís fróis.from the meiji restoration until the end of world war ii the full title of japan was dai nippon teikoku 大日本帝國 meaning the empire of great japan||today the name nihon-koku/nippon-koku 日本国 is used as a formal modern-day equivalent with the meaning of the state of japan||countries like japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given a name appended by the character koku 国 meaning country nation or state.||a paleolithic culture around bc constitutes the first known habitation of the japanese archipelago||this was followed from around bc the start of the jōmon period by a mesolithic to neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture including by ancestors of contemporary ainu people and yamato people||decorated clay vessels from this period are some of the oldest surviving examples of pottery in the world||around bc the yayoi people began to enter the japanese islands intermingling with the jōmon||the yayoi period starting around bc saw the introduction of practices like wet-rice farming a new style of pottery and metallurgy introduced from china and korea.japan first appears in written history in the chinese book of han||according to the records of the three kingdoms the most powerful kingdom on the archipelago during the third century was called yamataikoku||buddhism was introduced to japan from baekje korea and was promoted by prince shōtoku but the subsequent development of japanese buddhism was primarily influenced by china||despite early resistance buddhism was promoted by the ruling class and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the asuka period –.the nara period – marked an emergence of the centralized japanese state centered on the imperial court in heijō-kyō modern nara||the nara period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literature as well as the development of buddhist-inspired art and architecture||the smallpox epidemic of – is believed to have killed as much as one-third of japan's population||in emperor kanmu moved the capital from nara to nagaoka-kyō then to heian-kyō modern kyoto in ||this marked the beginning of the heian period – during which a distinctly indigenous japanese culture emerged noted for its art poetry and prose||murasaki shikibu's the tale of genji and the lyrics of japan's national anthem kimigayo were written during this time.buddhism began to spread during the heian era chiefly through two major sects tendai by saichō and shingon by kūkai||pure land buddhism jōdo-shū jōdo shinshū became greatly popular in the latter half of the th century.||japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors the samurai||in following the defeat of the taira clan in the genpei war sung in the epic tale of heike samurai minamoto no yoritomo was appointed shōgun by emperor go-toba and yoritomo established a base of power in kamakura||after his death the hōjō clan came to power as regents for the shōguns||the zen school of buddhism was introduced from china in the kamakura period – and became popular among the samurai class||the kamakura shogunate repelled mongol invasions in and but was eventually overthrown by emperor go-daigo||emperor go-daigo was himself defeated by ashikaga takauji in ||ashikaga takauji established the shogunate in muromachi kyoto||this was the start of the muromachi period –||the ashikaga shogunate achieved glory at the age of ashikaga yoshimitsu and the culture based on zen buddhism the art of miyabi prospered||this evolved to higashiyama culture and prospered until the th century||on the other hand the succeeding ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords daimyōs and a civil war the ōnin war began in opening the century-long sengoku period warring states.during the th century traders and jesuit missionaries from portugal reached japan for the first time initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between japan and the west||this allowed oda nobunaga to obtain european technology and firearms which he used to conquer many other daimyōs||his consolidation of power began what was known as the azuchi–momoyama period –||after nobunaga was assassinated in by akechi mitsuhide his successor toyotomi hideyoshi unified the nation in and launched two unsuccessful invasions of korea in and ||tokugawa ieyasu served as regent for hideyoshi's son and used his position to gain political and military support||when open war broke out ieyasu defeated rival clans in the battle of sekigahara in ||tokugawa ieyasu was appointed shōgun by emperor go-yōzei in and established the tokugawa shogunate in edo modern tokyo||the shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyōs and in the isolationist sakoku closed country policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the edo period –||the study of western sciences known as rangaku continued through contact with the dutch enclave at dejima in nagasaki||the edo period also gave rise to kokugaku national studies the study of japan by the japanese.||on march commodore matthew perry and the black ships of the united states navy forced the opening of japan to the outside world with the convention of kanagawa||subsequent similar treaties with western countries in the bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises||the resignation of the shōgun led to the boshin war and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor the meiji restoration.plunging itself through an active process of westernization during the meiji restoration in japan adopted western political judicial and military institutions and western cultural influences integrated with its traditional culture for modern industrialization||the cabinet organized the privy council introduced the meiji constitution and assembled the imperial diet||the meiji restoration transformed the empire of japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence||although france and britain showed some interest the european powers largely ignored japan and instead concentrated on the much greater attractions of china||france was also set back by its failures in mexico and defeat by the germans||after victories in the first sino-japanese war – and the russo-japanese war – japan gained control of taiwan korea and the southern half of sakhalin||in addition to imperialistic success japan also invested much more heavily in its own economic growth leading to a period of economic flourishing in the country which lasted until the great depression||japan's population grew from million in to million in ||in world war i japan joined the allies and captured german possessions and made advances into china||the early th century saw a period of taishō democracy – but the saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards statism the passing of laws against political dissent and a series of attempted coups||this process accelerated during the spawning a number of new radical nationalist groups which shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in asia||japanese expansionism and militarization along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism reshaped the country||in japan invaded and occupied manchuria and following international condemnation of this occupation it quit the league of nations in ||in japan signed the anti-comintern pact with germany and the tripartite pact made it one of the axis powers||the empire of japan invaded other parts of china in precipitating the second sino-japanese war –||the imperial japanese army swiftly captured the capital nanjing and conducted the nanking massacre||in the empire invaded french indochina after which the united states placed an oil embargo on japan||on december – japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on pearl harbor british forces in malaya singapore and hong kong and declared war on the united states and the british empire bringing the united states and the united kingdom into world war ii in the pacific||after allied victories across the pacific during the next four years which culminated in the soviet invasion of manchuria and the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki in japan agreed to an unconditional surrender on august ||the war cost japan its colonies china and the war's other combatants tens of millions of lives and left much of japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed||the allies led by the united states repatriated millions of ethnic japanese from colonies and military camps throughout asia largely eliminating the japanese empire and restoring the independence of its conquered territories||the allies also convened the international military tribunal for the far east on may to prosecute some senior generals for war crimes||in japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices||the allied occupation ended with the treaty of san francisco in and japan was granted membership in the united nations in ||japan later achieved rapid growth to become the second-largest economy in the world until surpassed by china in ||this ended in the mid-s when japan suffered a major recession||in the beginning of the st century positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery||on march japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history this triggered the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster one of the worst disasters in the history of nuclear power.||japan has a total of islands extending along the pacific coast||it is over km mi long from the sea of okhotsk to the philippine sea in the pacific ocean||the country including all of the islands it controls lies between latitudes ° and °n and longitudes ° and °e||the main islands from north to south are hokkaido honshu shikoku and kyushu||the middle ages is one of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme for analysing european history: classical civilisation or antiquity the middle ages and the modern period.medieval writers divided history into periods such as the six ages or the four empires and considered their time to be the last before the end of the world||when referring to their own times they spoke of them as being modern||in the the humanist and poet petrarch referred to pre-christian times as antiqua or ancient and to the christian period as nova or new||leonardo bruni was the first historian to use tripartite periodisation in his history of the florentine people ||bruni and later historians argued that italy had recovered since petrarch's time and therefore added a third period to petrarch's two||the middle ages first appears in latin in as media tempestas or middle season||in early usage there were many variants including medium aevum or middle age first recorded in and media saecula or middle ages first recorded in ||the alternative term medieval or occasionally mediaeval or mediæval derives from medium aevum||tripartite periodisation became standard after the german th-century historian christoph cellarius divided history into three periods: ancient medieval and modern.the most commonly given starting point for the middle ages is around with the date of first used by bruni||later starting dates are sometimes used in the outer parts of europe||for europe as a whole is often considered to be the end of the middle ages but there is no universally agreed upon end date||depending on the context events such as the conquest of constantinople by the turks in christopher columbus's first voyage to the americas in or the protestant reformation in are sometimes used||english historians often use the battle of bosworth field in to mark the end of the period||for spain dates commonly used are the death of king ferdinand ii in the death of queen isabella i of castile in or the conquest of granada in ||historians from romance-speaking countries tend to divide the middle ages into two parts: an earlier high and later low period||english-speaking historians following their german counterparts generally subdivide the middle ages into three intervals: early high and late||in the th century the entire middle ages were often referred to as the dark ages but with the adoption of these subdivisions use of this term was restricted to the early middle ages at least among historians.||the roman empire reached its greatest territorial extent during the nd century ad the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of roman control over its outlying territories||economic issues including inflation and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the crisis of the third century with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers||military expenses increased steadily during the rd century mainly in response to the war with the sasanian empire which revived in the middle of the rd century||the army doubled in size and cavalry and smaller units replaced the roman legion as the main tactical unit||the need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial or landowning class and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder the burdens of holding office in their native towns||more bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.the emperor diocletian r||– split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other||in after a period of civil war constantine the great r||– refounded the city of byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital constantinople||diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy reformed taxation and strengthened the army which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation a declining birthrate and pressures on its frontiers among others||civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the th century diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach||for much of the th century roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period with a widening gulf between the rich and poor and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns||another change was the christianisation or conversion of the empire to christianity a gradual process that lasted from the nd to the th centuries||in the goths fleeing from the huns received permission from emperor valens r||– to settle in the roman province of thracia in the balkans||the settlement did not go smoothly and when roman officials mishandled the situation the goths began to raid and plunder||valens attempting to put down the disorder was killed fighting the goths at the battle of adrianople on august ||as well as the threat from such tribal confederacies from the north internal divisions within the empire especially within the christian church caused problems||in the visigoths invaded the western roman empire and although briefly forced back from italy in sacked the city of rome||in the alans vandals and suevi crossed into gaul over the next three years they spread across gaul and in crossed the pyrenees mountains into modern-day spain||the migration period began when various peoples initially largely germanic peoples moved across europe||the franks alemanni and the burgundians all ended up in northern gaul while the angles saxons and jutes settled in britain and the vandals went on to cross the strait of gibraltar after which they conquered the province of africa||in the the huns began invading the empire their king attila r||– led invasions into the balkans in and gaul in and italy in ||the hunnic threat remained until attila's death in when the hunnic confederation he led fell apart||these invasions by the tribes completely changed the political and demographic nature of what had been the western roman empire.by the end of the th century the western section of the empire was divided into smaller political units ruled by the tribes that had invaded in the early part of the century||the deposition of the last emperor of the west romulus augustulus in has traditionally marked the end of the western roman empire||by the italian peninsula was conquered by the ostrogoths||the eastern roman empire often referred to as the byzantine empire after the fall of its western counterpart had little ability to assert control over the lost western territories||the byzantine emperors maintained a claim over the territory but while none of the new kings in the west dared to elevate himself to the position of emperor of the west byzantine control of most of the western empire could not be sustained the reconquest of the mediterranean periphery and the italian peninsula gothic war in the reign of justinian r||– was the sole and temporary exception.||the political structure of western europe changed with the end of the united roman empire||although the movements of peoples during this period are usually described as invasions they were not just military expeditions but migrations of entire peoples into the empire||such movements were aided by the refusal of the western roman elites to support the army or pay the taxes that would have allowed the military to suppress the migration||the emperors of the th century were often controlled by military strongmen such as stilicho d||aetius d||aspar d||ricimer d||or gundobad d||who were partly or fully of non-roman background||when the line of western emperors ceased many of the kings who replaced them were from the same background||intermarriage between the new kings and the roman elites was common||this led to a fusion of roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes including the popular assemblies that allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than was common in the roman state||material artefacts left by the romans and the invaders are often similar and tribal items were often modelled on roman objects||much of the scholarly and written culture of the new kingdoms was also based on roman intellectual traditions||an important difference was the gradual loss of tax revenue by the new polities||the word animal comes from the latin animalis meaning having breath having soul or living being||the biological definition includes all members of the kingdom animalia||in colloquial usage as a consequence of anthropocentrism the term animal is sometimes used nonscientifically to refer only to non-human animals.||animals have several characteristics that set them apart from other living things||animals are eukaryotic and multicellular unlike bacteria which are prokaryotic and unlike protists which are eukaryotic but unicellular||unlike plants and algae which produce their own nutrients animals are heterotrophic feeding on organic material and digesting it internally||with very few exceptions animals breathe oxygen and respire aerobically||all animals are motile able to spontaneously move their bodies during at least part of their life cycle but some animals such as sponges corals mussels and barnacles later become sessile||the blastula is a stage in embryonic development that is unique to most animals allowing cells to be differentiated into specialised tissues and organs.||all animals are composed of cells surrounded by a characteristic extracellular matrix composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins||during development the animal extracellular matrix forms a relatively flexible framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganised making the formation of complex structures possible||this may be calcified forming structures such as shells bones and spicules||in contrast the cells of other multicellular organisms primarily algae plants and fungi are held in place by cell walls and so develop by progressive growth||animal cells uniquely possess the cell junctions called tight junctions gap junctions and desmosomes.with few exceptions—in particular the sponges and placozoans—animal bodies are differentiated into tissues||these include muscles which enable locomotion and nerve tissues which transmit signals and coordinate the body||typically there is also an internal digestive chamber with either one opening as in flatworms or two openings as in deuterostomes.||nearly all animals make use of some form of sexual reproduction||they produce haploid gametes by meiosis the smaller motile gametes are spermatozoa and the larger non-motile gametes are ova||these fuse to form zygotes which develop via mitosis into a hollow sphere called a blastula||in sponges blastula larvae swim to a new location attach to the seabed and develop into a new sponge||in its most narrow usage fiction refers to novels but it may also denote any literary narrative see literary fiction including novels novellas and short stories||more broadly fiction has come to encompass imaginative storytelling in any format including writings theatrical performances comics films television programs animations games most notably video games and role-playing games and so on||a work of fiction implies the inventive act of constructing an imaginary world so its audience does not typically expect it to be totally faithful to the real world in presenting only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true||instead the context of fiction generally understood as not adhering precisely to the real world is more open to interpretation||characters and events within a fictional work may even be set in their own context entirely separate from the known universe: an independent fictional universe||fiction's traditional opposite is non-fiction a narrative work whose creator assumes responsibility for presenting only the historical and factual truth||the distinction between fiction and non-fiction however can be unclear in some recent artistic and literary movements such as postmodern literature.||traditionally fiction includes novels short stories fables legends myths fairy tales epic and narrative poetry plays including operas musicals dramas puppet plays and various kinds of theatrical dances||however fiction may also encompass comic books and many animated cartoons stop motions anime manga films video games radio programs television programs comedies and dramas etc||the internet has had a major impact on the creation and distribution of fiction calling into question the feasibility of copyright as a means to ensure royalties are paid to copyright holders||also digital libraries such as project gutenberg make public domain texts more readily available||the combination of inexpensive home computers the internet and the creativity of its users has also led to new forms of fiction such as interactive computer games or computer-generated comics||countless forums for fan fiction can be found online where loyal followers of specific fictional realms create and distribute derivative stories||the internet is also used for the development of blog fiction where a story is delivered through a blog either as flash fiction or serial blog and collaborative fiction where a story is written sequentially by different authors or the entire text can be revised by anyone using a wiki||types of literary fiction in prose include: short story: a work of at least words but under words||the boundary between a long short story and a novella is vague||novella: a work of at least words but under words||joseph conrad's heart of darkness is an example of a novella||novel: a work of words or more.||fiction is commonly broken down into a variety of genres: subsets of fiction each differentiated by a particular unifying tone or style narrative technique media content or popularly defined criterion||science fiction for example predicts or supposes technologies that are not realities at the time of the work's creation: jules verne's novel from the earth to the moon was published in and only in did astronaut neil armstrong first land on the moon||historical fiction places imaginary characters into real historical events||in the early historical novel waverley sir walter scott's fictional character edward waverley meets a figure from history bonnie prince charlie and takes part in the battle of prestonpans||some works of fiction are slightly or greatly re-imagined based on some originally true story or a reconstructed biography||often even when the fictional story is based on fact there may be additions and subtractions from the true story to make it more interesting||an example is tim o'brien's the things they carried a series of short stories about the vietnam war||fictional works that explicitly involve supernatural magical or scientifically impossible elements are often classified under the genre of fantasy including lewis carroll's alice in wonderland j||k||rowling's harry potter series and j||r||r||tolkien's the lord of the rings||creators of fantasy sometimes introduce imaginary creatures and beings such as dragons and fairies.||literary fiction is a term used in the book-trade to distinguish novels that are regarded as having literary merit from most commercial or genre fiction||neal stephenson has suggested that while any definition will be simplistic there is today a general cultural difference between literary and genre fiction||on the one hand literary authors nowadays are frequently supported by patronage with employment at a university or a similar institution and with the continuation of such positions determined not by book sales but by critical acclaim by other established literary authors and critics||on the other hand he suggests genre fiction writers tend to support themselves by book sales||however in an interview john updike lamented that the category of 'literary fiction' has sprung up recently to torment people like me who just set out to write books and if anybody wanted to read them terrific the more the merrier||..||i'm a genre writer of a sort||i write literary fiction which is like spy fiction or chick lit||likewise on the charlie rose show he argued that this term when applied to his work greatly limited him and his expectations of what might come of his writing so he does not really like it||he suggested that all his works are literary simply because they are written in words.literary fiction often involves social commentary political criticism or reflection on the human condition||in general it focuses on introspective in-depth character studies of interesting complex and developed characters||this contrasts with genre fiction where plot is the central concern||usually in literary fiction the focus is on the inner story of the characters who drive the plot with detailed motivations to elicit emotional involvement in the reader||the style of literary fiction is often described as elegantly written lyrical and ..||layered||the tone of literary fiction can be darker than genre fiction while the pacing of literary fiction may be slower than popular fiction||as terrence rafferty notes literary fiction by its nature allows itself to dawdle to linger on stray beauties even at the risk of losing its way.||realistic fiction typically involves a story whose basic setting time and location in the world is real and whose events could feasibly happen in a real-world setting non-realistic fiction involves a story where the opposite is the case often being set in an entirely imaginary universe an alternative history of the world other than that currently understood as true or some other non-existent location or time-period sometimes even presenting impossible technology or a defiance of the currently understood laws of nature||however all types of fiction arguably invite their audience to explore real ideas issues or possibilities in an otherwise imaginary setting or using what is understood about reality to mentally construct something similar to reality though still distinct from it.in terms of the traditional separation between fiction and non-fiction the lines are now commonly understood as blurred showing more overlap than mutual exclusion||even fiction usually has elements of or grounding in truth||the distinction between the two may be best defined from the perspective of the audience according to whom a work is regarded as non-fiction if its people places and events are all historically or factually real while a work is regarded as fiction if it deviates from reality in any of those areas||the distinction between fiction and non-fiction is further obscured by an understanding on the one hand that the truth can be presented through imaginary channels and constructions while on the other hand imagination can just as well bring about significant conclusions about truth and reality.literary critic james wood argues that fiction is both artifice and verisimilitude meaning that it requires both creative invention as well as some acceptable degree of believability a notion often encapsulated in poet samuel taylor coleridge's term: willing suspension of disbelief||also infinite fictional possibilities themselves signal the impossibility of fully knowing reality provocatively demonstrating that there is no criterion to measure constructs of reality.||eco umberto ||on the ontology of fictional characters: a semiotic approach||the first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in temple rooms in sumer some dating back to bc||these archives which mainly consisted of the records of commercial transactions or inventories mark the end of prehistory and the start of history.things were much the same in the government and temple records on papyrus of ancient egypt||the earliest discovered private archives were kept at ugarit besides correspondence and inventories texts of myths may have been standardized practice-texts for teaching new scribes||there is also evidence of libraries at nippur about bc and those at nineveh about bc showing a library classification system.over clay tablets from the library of ashurbanipal have been discovered at nineveh providing modern scholars with an amazing wealth of mesopotamian literary religious and administrative work||among the findings were the enuma elish also known as the epic of creation which depicts a traditional babylonian view of creation the epic of gilgamesh a large selection of omen texts including enuma anu enlil which contained omens dealing with the moon its visibility eclipses and conjunction with planets and fixed stars the sun its corona spots and eclipses the weather namely lightning thunder and clouds and the planets and their visibility appearance and stations and astronomic/astrological texts as well as standard lists used by scribes and scholars such as word lists bilingual vocabularies lists of signs and synonyms and lists of medical diagnoses||the tablets were stored in a variety of containers such as wooden boxes woven baskets of reeds or clay shelves||the libraries were cataloged using colophons which are a publisher's imprint on the spine of a book or in this case a tablet||the colophons stated the series name the title of the tablet and any extra information the scribe needed to indicate||eventually the clay tablets were organized by subject and size||unfortunately due to limited to bookshelf space once more tablets were added to the library older ones were removed which is why some tablets are missing from the excavated cities in mesopotamia.according to legend mythical philosopher laozi was keeper of books in the earliest library in china which belonged to the imperial zhou dynasty||also evidence of catalogues found in some destroyed ancient libraries illustrates the presence of librarians.||the library of alexandria in egypt was the largest and most significant great library of the ancient world||it flourished under the patronage of the ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from its construction in the rd century bc until the roman conquest of egypt in bc||the library was conceived and opened either during the reign of ptolemy i soter – bc or during the reign of his son ptolemy ii – bc||an early organization system was in effect at alexandria||the great library of alexandria would remain as the intellectual capital of the western world during the rise of christianity even after the library had suffered through fires and conquest||this great library was more than a place to hold books and records it became a place of culture||the alexandrian book collections steadily diminished as a result of natural causes war and wholesale theft by corrupt administrators.the library of celsus in ephesus anatolia now part of selçuk turkey was built in honor of the roman senator tiberius julius celsus polemaeanus completed in by celsus' son gaius julius aquila consul ad||the library was built to store scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for celsus||private or personal libraries made up of written books as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in archives appeared in classical greece in the th century bc||the celebrated book collectors of hellenistic antiquity were listed in the late nd century in deipnosophistae||all these libraries were greek||the cultivated hellenized diners in deipnosophistae pass over the libraries of rome in silence||by the time of augustus there were public libraries near the forums of rome||there were libraries in the porticus octaviae near the theatre of marcellus in the temple of apollo palatinus and in the bibliotheca ulpiana in the forum of trajan||the state archives were kept in a structure on the slope between the roman forum and the capitoline hill||private libraries appeared during the late republic: seneca inveighed against libraries fitted out for show by illiterate owners who scarcely read their titles in the course of a lifetime but displayed the scrolls in bookcases armaria of citrus wood inlaid with ivory that ran right to the ceiling: by now like bathrooms and hot water a library is got up as standard equipment for a fine house domus||libraries were amenities suited to a villa such as cicero's at tusculum maecenas's several villas or pliny the younger's all described in surviving letters||at the villa of the papyri at herculaneum apparently the villa of caesar's father-in-law the greek library has been partly preserved in volcanic ash archaeologists speculate that a latin library kept separate from the greek one may await discovery at the site||in the west the first public libraries were established under the roman empire as each succeeding emperor strove to open one or many which outshone that of his predecessor||rome's first public library was established by asinius pollio||pollio was a lieutenant of julius caesar and one of his most ardent supporters||after his military victory in illyria pollio felt he had enough fame and fortune to create what julius caesar had sought for a long time: a public library to increase the prestige of rome and rival the one in alexandria||pollios's library the anla libertatis which was housed in the atrium libertatis was centrally located near the forum romanum||it was the first to employ an architectural design that separated works into greek and latin||all subsequent roman public libraries will have this design||at the conclusion of rome's civil wars following the death of marcus antonius in bc the emperor augustus sought to reconstruct many of rome's damaged buildings||during this construction augustus created two more public libraries||the first was the library of the temple of apollo on the palatine often called the palatine library and the second was the library of the porticus of octaviae.two more libraries were added by the emperor tiberius on palatine hill and one by vespasian after ad||vespasian's library was constructed in the forum of vespasian also known as the forum of peace and became one of rome's principal libraries||the bibliotheca pacis was built along the traditional model and had two large halls with rooms for greek and latin libraries containing the works of galen and lucius aelius||one of the best preserved was the ancient ulpian library built by the emperor trajan||completed in / the ulpian library was part of trajan's forum built on the capitoline hill||trajan's column separated the greek and latin rooms which faced each other||the structure was approximately fifty feet high with the peak of the roof reaching almost seventy feet.unlike the greek libraries readers had direct access to the scrolls which were kept on shelves built into the walls of a large room||reading or copying was normally done in the room itself||the surviving records give only a few instances of lending features||most of the large roman baths were also cultural centres built from the start with a library a two-room arrangement with one room for greek and one for latin texts||libraries were filled with parchment scrolls as at library of pergamum and on papyrus scrolls as at alexandria: the export of prepared writing materials was a staple of commerce||there were a few institutional or royal libraries which were open to an educated public such as the serapeum collection of the library of alexandria once the largest library in the ancient world but on the whole collections were private||in those rare cases where it was possible for a scholar to consult library books there seems to have been no direct access to the stacks||in all recorded cases the books were kept in a relatively small room where the staff went to get them for the readers who had to consult them in an adjoining hall or covered walkway||most of the works in catalogs were of a religious nature such as volumes of the bible or religious service books||in a number of cases the library was entirely theological and liturgical and in the greater part of the libraries the non-ecclesiastical content did not reach one third of the total in addition to these types of works in some libraries during that time plato was especially popular||in the early middle ages aristotle was more popular||additionally there was quite a bit of censoring within libraries of the time many works that were scientific and metaphysical were not included in the majority of libraries during that time period||ludwig wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to address the definition of the word game||in his philosophical investigations wittgenstein argued that the elements of games such as play rules and competition all fail to adequately define what games are||from this wittgenstein concluded that people apply the term game to a range of disparate human activities that bear to one another only what one might call family resemblances||as the following game definitions show this conclusion was not a final one and today many philosophers like thomas hurka think that wittgenstein was wrong and that bernard suits' definition is a good answer to the problem.||french sociologist roger caillois in his book les jeux et les hommes games and men defined a game as an activity that must have the following characteristics: fun: the activity is chosen for its light-hearted character separate: it is circumscribed in time and place uncertain: the outcome of the activity is unforeseeable non-productive: participation does not accomplish anything useful governed by rules: the activity has rules that are different from everyday life fictitious: it is accompanied by the awareness of a different reality||computer game designer chris crawford founder of the journal of computer game design has attempted to define the term game using a series of dichotomies: creative expression is art if made for its own beauty and entertainment if made for money||a piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive||movies and books are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment||if no goals are associated with a plaything it is a toy||crawford notes that by his definition a a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules and b the sims and simcity are toys not games||if it has goals a plaything is a challenge||if a challenge has no active agent against whom you compete it is a puzzle if there is one it is a conflict||crawford admits that this is a subjective test||video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in pac-man||finally if the player can only outperform the opponent but not attack them to interfere with their performance the conflict is a competition||competitions include racing and figure skating||however if attacks are allowed then the conflict qualifies as a game.crawford's definition may thus be rendered as: an interactive goal-oriented activity made for money with active agents to play against in which players including active agents can interfere with each other.||a game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict defined by rules that results in a quantifiable outcome||katie salen and eric zimmerman a game is a form of art in which participants termed players make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal||greg costikyan according to this definition some games that do not involve choices such as chutes and ladders candy land and war are not technically games any more than a slot machine is||a game is an activity among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context||clark c||abt at its most elementary level then we can define game as an exercise of voluntary control systems in which there is an opposition between forces confined by a procedure and rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome||elliot avedon and brian sutton-smith a game is a form of play with goals and structure||kevin j||maroney to play a game is to engage in activity directed toward bringing about a specific state of affairs using only means permitted by specific rules where the means permitted by the rules are more limited in scope than they would be in the absence of the rules and where the sole reason for accepting such limitation is to make possible such activity||bernard suits when you strip away the genre differences and the technological complexities all games share four defining traits: a goal rules a feedback system and voluntary participation||jane mcgonigal||games can be characterized by what the player does||this is often referred to as gameplay||major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of game.||games are often classified by the components required to play them e.g||miniatures a ball cards a board and pieces or a computer||in places where the use of leather is well-established the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history resulting in a worldwide popularity of ball games such as rugby basketball soccer football cricket tennis and volleyball||other tools are more idiosyncratic to a certain region||many countries in europe for instance have unique standard decks of playing cards||other games such as chess may be traced primarily through the development and evolution of its game pieces||many game tools are tokens meant to represent other things||a token may be a pawn on a board play money or an intangible item such as a point scored||games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not use any obvious tool rather their interactivity is defined by the environment||games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is altered||for example hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game in a park an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course even with the same cars.||whereas games are often characterized by their tools they are often defined by their rules||while rules are subject to variations and changes enough change in the rules usually results in a new game||for instance baseball can be played with real baseballs or with wiffleballs||however if the players decide to play with only three bases they are arguably playing a different game||there are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own rules but even then there are often immutable meta-rules||rules generally determine the time-keeping system the rights and responsibilities of the players and each player's goals||player rights may include when they may spend resources or move tokens||common win conditions are being first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens as in settlers of catan having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the game as in monopoly or some relationship of one's game tokens to those of one's opponent as in chess's checkmate.||a game's tools and rules will result in its requiring skill strategy luck or a combination thereof and are classified accordingly||games of skill include games of physical skill such as wrestling tug of war hopscotch target shooting and stake and games of mental skill such as checkers and chess||games of strategy include checkers chess go arimaa and tic-tac-toe and often require special equipment to play them||games of chance include gambling games blackjack mahjong roulette etc||as well as snakes and ladders and rock paper scissors most require equipment such as cards or dice||however most games contain two or all three of these elements||for example american football and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy while tiddlywinks poker and monopoly combine strategy and chance||many card and board games combine all three most trick-taking games involve mental skill strategy and an element of chance as do many strategic board games such as risk settlers of catan and carcassonne.||most games require multiple players||however single-player games are unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces||unlike a game with multiple players

economics for this important result which extended von neumann's theory of zero-sum games||nash's stable solution is known as the nash equilibrium.if cooperation between players is allowed then the game becomes more complex many concepts have been developed to analyze such games||while these have had some partial success in the fields of economics politics and conflict no good general theory has yet been developed.in quantum game theory it has been found that the introduction of quantum information into multiplayer games allows a new type of equilibrium strategy not found in traditional
